      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are established therapeutics for weight loss that are increasingly used for BMI optimization prior to spine surgery. However, emerging evidence has suggested that GLP-1 agonists might reduce bone mineral density (BMD), increasing the risk of postoperative biomechanical complications. CT-based Hounsfield units (HUs) have gained popularity as a method for measuring spinal BMD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GLP-1 agonist-induced weight loss on spinal BMD as measured by opportunistic CT-based HUs.",

PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however, its application to CD remains unknown.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular degeneration in Erdheim-Chester disease: prevalence, burden, and outcomes.",
      "abstract": "Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare systemic histiocytic neoplasm, with cardiac morbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and cardiac conditions, playing a significant yet poorly understood role in the disease burden. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and prognosis of ECD in patients with (ECD-C) and without cardiac involvement (ECD-noC) and compared the burden of cardiac morbidities with matched controls. Patients diagnosed with ECD between 1990 and 2021 at a tertiary center were included, with cardiac involvement centrally assessed using radiographic studies. Cardiac morbidities were compared with a control group without ECD, matched for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking history. Among 104 patients with ECD, 39 (37%) had cardiac involvement. Patients with ECD-C had higher rates of hypertension (67% vs 46%), hyperlipidemia (67% vs 40%), heart failure (36% vs 8%), and pericardial effusion (28% vs 2%) than those with ECD-noC. Compared with the matched non-ECD cohort, patients with ECD had higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (20% vs 7%), heart failure (18% vs 4%), and antihypertensive drug use (55% vs 40%). Notably, patients with ECD-C had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) from frontline therapy compared with patients with ECD-noC (5-year PFS, 28.3% vs 70.5%). These findings highlight the burden of CV risk factors and cardiac conditions in ECD, even without a clinical diagnosis of ECD-C. Importantly, this cardiac morbidity burden is substantial for patients with ECD-C compared with ECD-noC. Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive cardiac risk assessment and management strategies to improve patient outcomes.",

      "title": "Infection-sensing minigenome as a novel therapeutic approach against Ebola virus.",
      "abstract": "We describe here a molecular therapy that uses the virus's own proteins to combat itself. In this approach, infection-sensing RNAs encoding therapeutic genes are flanked by viral promoters and packaging signals in negative-sense orientation. These therapeutic minigenome RNAs do not express the transgene and remain silent in the absence of a viral infection. In contrast, if the cell is infected, the virus acts as a helper virus, providing viral proteins in trans to transcribe, replicate, and package the therapeutic minigenomes. Proof of concept for this therapeutic approach is demonstrated here using Ebola virus (EBOV) minigenomes expressing two antiviral transgenes: a short-hairpin (sh) RNA targeting the EBOV viral protein VP24 and an open-reading frame expressing a host peptide from the retinoblastoma-binding protein 6 (RBBP6). By using an EBOV tetracistronic-minigenome as a virus life cycle modeling system, we show here that both therapeutic minigenomes suppressed viral RNA replication and viral protein production, and a more than 50% reduction in the reporter signal was observed when cells were challenged with EBOV transcription/replication-competent virus-like particles. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of infection-sensing minigenome to combat EBOV and perhaps other viral pathogens.",

      "abstract": "Following resection of a primary bone tumour, reconstruction is commonly performed using either a megaprosthesis or biological reconstruction. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains one of the most frequent complications.

This study aimed to investigate the global practices regarding DAIR in tumour cases through an electronic survey among orthopaedic oncology surgeons.",

      "abstract": "Reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) ratio found with long echo-time proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H-MRS) of deep brain structures in a Seabees Battalion in 1997-1998 was soon replicated by two studies but not in a later one using intermediate echo time. We undertook this study in 2008-2009 to repeat the previous long echo-time 1H-MRS study with 1H-MRS at both long (TE = 270 ms) and short (TE = 30 ms) echo time and higher field strength (3T) to test whether the abnormality of NAA/tCr affecting this Battalion had normalized or been obscured by effects of the T2 decay curve. Under investigator blinding, 39 Seabees in the three GWI variant groups and 16 Seabees controls prospectively underwent 1H-MRS at both short (TE = 30 ms) and long (TE = 270 ms) echo time to measure metabolites and at five TE values between 60 ms and 270 ms to measure transverse relaxation time (T2) in the basal ganglia. A mixed-effects linear model adjusting for age tested group differences. Findings supported the observations of the prior studies, demonstrating that veterans with GWI no longer had reduced NAA/tCr at long echo time but had significantly lower basal ganglia NAA/tCr than controls at short echo time (left: 1.22 ± 0.02 vs. 1.38 ± 0.03, P < 0.0001; right: 1.12 ± 0.02 vs. 1.18 ± 0.03, P = 0.059). The group differences were mainly due to higher [tCr] (left: 14.1%, P = 0.0001; right: 9.1%, P = 0.009) rather than lower [NAA] in the ill groups. Longer echo time substantially reduced the sensitivity of 1H-MRS. Chronic metabolite abnormalities persisted in GWI for 10 more years but remained detectable only at short echo time. That reduced NAA/tCr is due primarily to increased [tCr] rather than decreased [NAA] supports recent studies implicating mitochondrial dysfunction with ATP depletion and neuroinflammation as causative factors and therapeutic targets in GWI.",
