      "title": "Bridging the Physician Knowledge Gap in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Breast Imaging Care.",
      "abstract": "Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face unique challenges in accessing affirming, evidence-based breast imaging care because of longstanding disparities in provider education, institutional practices, and imaging guidelines. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, such as chest masculinization or breast augmentation, impact breast tissue composition and cancer risk, necessitating individualized imaging approaches. Through multiple clinical vignettes, this article illustrates potential pitfalls and key considerations in breast imaging for TGD patients, including appropriate imaging recommendations, inclusive system-level changes, and navigating patient encounters. Education of breast imaging radiologists, technologists, and front-desk staff is critical to bridge the known knowledge gap and improve outcomes for this patient population. By adopting inclusive, culturally competent, and trauma-informed practices, breast imaging professionals can help reduce disparities and improve the experience and health outcomes of TGD patients.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.

      "title": "USP29 and SMURF1 orchestrate FSP1-mediated ferroptosis suppression to facilitate chemoresistance in gastric cancer.",
      "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Chemoresistance poses a major obstacle to successful treatment for GC patients. Here, we demonstrate that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) enables chemoresistance in GC by inhibiting ferroptosis, resulting in diminished chemotherapy response and reduced patient survival rate. USP29 and SMURF1 are subsequently discovered as the deubiquitinase and E3 ligase of FSP1, respectively, orchestrating the ubiquitination of FSP1 to modulate ferroptosis and chemoresistance in GC. In the ubiquitination process, SMURF1 is observed to interact with and polyubiquitinate FSP1 within K63/K193 sites. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of FSP1 by iFSP1 is shown to synergize with chemotherapeutic agents across chemoresistant cellular and mouse models. Our findings thus underscore the pivotal role of the USP29 and SMURF1 in regulating GC chemoresistance via FSP1-mediated ferroptosis suppression. FSP1 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic avenue to overcome chemoresistance in GC.© 2025. The Author(s).",

      "llm_summary": "This study found that the proteins USP29 and SMURF1 help gastric cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy by regulating a protein called FSP1, which suppresses a type of cell death called ferroptosis. Inhibiting FSP1 was shown to make chemotherapy more effective in resistant cancer cells and animal models, suggesting that targeting FSP1 could be a promising approach to overcoming chemoresistance in gastric cancer.",
