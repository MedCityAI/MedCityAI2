41145405,"Seroprevalence and Incidence of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella in Adult Solid Organ Transplant Recipients in the United States: A Large Database Analysis.","Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is rare. We aim to investigate the pretransplant seroprevalence, MMR infection posttransplant, and whether immediate pretransplant MMR vaccination is associated with MMR infection.We queried the TriNetX database in December 2024 to assess (1) pretransplant MMR seroprevalence, (2) characteristics and outcomes of posttransplant MMR infections, and (3) outcomes for recipients who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant. Only US data were included. MMR infection was identified through International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.Among 313 548 SOT recipients identified in the database (from 2009 to 2024), IgG positivity for MMR was 72%, 80%, and 78% when available (~5% each). Based on ICD codes, posttransplant MMR infections occurred in 107 (0.03%), 124 (0.04%), and 38 (0.01%) recipients, respectively. The 90-d rejection rates were 36%, 27%, and 42%, whereas mortality rates were 7%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, in patients with MMR infection. Among 114 recipients vaccinated within 30 d pretransplant, none developed posttransplant MMR infections.Overall, posttransplant MMR infections in adult SOT recipients were uncommon in this data set, and no vaccine-associated infections were documented among those who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant in real-world practice. The primary limitation of this study is that most MMR infections were identified using ICD codes without confirmation through serological testing or polymerase chain reaction, and we were unable to further characterize the infections because the de-identified database lacked information on the patient's ZIP code and transplant hospital. Our study highlights the need for improvement in MMR serology screening and pretransplant MMR vaccination.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41144907,New Clues to the Challenge of Knee Arthrofibrosis: From Molecules to Therapies.,"Knee arthrofibrosis (AF) is a debilitating complication after total knee arthroplasty. AF is characterized by formation of fibrotic adhesions, loss of joint mobility, and pain. With osteoarthritis prevalence and associated total knee arthroplasties projected to rise sharply, AF is becoming increasingly prevalent, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood and no effective treatments exist. Like other fibrotic diseases, knee AF is a multifactorial disease that exhibits TGFβ1-driven myofibroblast transformation and excessive collagen deposition. However, knee AF also displays unique features, including rapid disease development and the establishment of a highly fibrotic mass rather than fibrotic tissue infiltration. Our integrative research approach uses human patient fibroblasts, multiomics profiling, and in vivo animal models to dissect disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Our work suggests altered adipogenic cell differentiation in the knee and epigenetic pathways controlling myofibroblastogenesis to be involved in AF development. Anti-inflammatory interventions with ketotifen and celecoxib reduce knee AF in vivo, indicating a contributory role of inflammation as well. Together, our novel findings elucidate causal and mechanistic drivers of AF and define this disease as an adipose-depleted fibrotic disorder driven by aberrant differentiation and epigenetic regulation, suggesting new therapeutic avenues for intervention.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Oct 28, 2025",2025,Oct,28,Thaler R|Payne A N|Berry D J|Abdel M P,Thaler R,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Thaler R, Payne A N, Berry D J, Abdel M P",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144907/,"Knee arthrofibrosis is a serious complication that can occur after knee replacement surgery, causing pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility.

40590852,"Impact of transplant conditioning, NPM1 mutations, and measurable residual disease in FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia.","We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1506 (MORPHO), a randomized trial of gilteritinib vs placebo as posttransplantation maintenance for patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), focusing the interactions between conditioning regimen intensity, measurable residual disease (MRD), and NPM1 comutation status reported from diagnosis. Comparing FLT3-ITD MRD before and after conditioning, there was no difference between myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in eradication or reduction of FLT3-ITD MRD. For participants who were FLT3-ITD MRD negative before HCT, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse during follow-up between those receiving MAC vs RIC. NPM1 comutation was associated with the largest magnitude of relapse-free survival benefit from post-HCT gilteritinib, and in these participants, post-HCT gilteritinib in the setting of RIC appeared to be as effective as MAC at preventing relapse. MAC appeared superior to RIC in preventing relapse only in participants who were NPM1 wild type at diagnosis and FLT3-ITD MRD positive before HCT. Our findings suggest that only a subset of patients with FLT3-ITD AML undergoing HCT may benefit from MAC and that, similar to AML therapy before HCT, the intensity of the HCT regimen should be adapted according to the molecular features of the disease.

40222034,Assessing the Outcomes of the Initial Virtual Breast Imaging Fellowship Interview Season.,"To assess breast imaging fellowship program directors' perspectives of the outcomes of the first-ever virtual interview season. A 19-question survey was constructed by members of the Fellowship Match Committee of the Society of Breast Imaging and distributed via email to 103 program directors. An initial email with a link to the survey was distributed on May 17, 2023, with 2 reminder emails sent on May 31, 2023, and June 20, 2023. The survey was closed on June 26, 2023. Results were compiled, and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Excel. There were 36 total responses yielding a response rate of 35% (36/103). The majority of programs, 61% (22/36), did not fill positions with any internal candidates. Overall, 72% answered that the perception of their fellow's performance was equal to or higher than those in prior years. Despite the effects of the pandemic on clinical exposure for this cohort, 73% of programs stated that the fellow's foundational knowledge was equivalent or better. Remarkably, 81% of respondents stated that procedural skills were equivalent or better, and 78% stated that communication skills were equivalent or better. This is the first study to investigate the outcomes of the unexpected pivot to virtual interviews. Despite the lack of preparation for this operational shift, it does not appear to have negatively impacted the program directors' impressions of their matched fellows.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.

40788396,Challenges of using natriuretic peptides to screen for the risk of developing heart failure in patients with diabetes: a report from the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Bio-Markers (C-CB).,"Several guidelines groups have made recommendations about how to use natriuretic peptides (NPs) to screen patients with diabetes for incipient heart failure. This group is at risk for undetected and stage B heart failure, where structural heart disease is present despite the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. These recommendations are based on trial data that suggest there are therapeutic options to benefit these patients.These guidelines do not adequately account for the marked analytic differences between NP assays nor their high degree of biological and analytical variability. Thus, without additional data and guidance, these recommendations could lead to excessive testing for some groups but might disadvantage others. In addition, these issues could lead to difficulties in the interpretation of values. Accordingly, the Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Bio Markers of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry has developed a consensus educational document to describe these difficulties and define areas where additional data are needed. Clinicians should be cognizant of differences in the assays for NPs, the high degree of variability of values, differences in sex and ethnicity and the need to factor in a variety of clinical and treatment variables in interpreting NP values.These suggestions for diabetes eventually will include others at high risk. They will require close attention to the issues involved in measuring and interpreting NP values.© 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"Oct 27, 2025",2025,Oct,27,Jaffe A S|Sandoval Y|Mills N L|Omland T|Aakre K M,Jaffe A S,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, 4352 Mayo Clinic , Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Minneapolis Heart Institute, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, and Center for Coronary Artery Disease, Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation, Minneapolis, MN, USA.|BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.|Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.|Department of Cardiology, Division of Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.|K.G.

40935587,Patient-Reported and Radiological Outcomes of Primary Bilateral Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using a Principles-Based Approach.,"Bilateral sacroiliac joint fusion (BSIJF) is an accepted management strategy for sacroiliac joint dysfunction, though outcomes data are limited by patient number and lack of long-term follow-up. This study investigated the clinical, radiological, and patient-reported outcomes of BSIJF.A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent BSIJF with a single surgeon between 2020 and 2023. All BSIJF utilized a principles-based approach: joint decortication, bone grafting, compression, and rigid stability. Patient-reported outcomes at preoperative, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up timepoints were recorded for the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), PROMIS Pain Interference (PI), and PROMIS Physical Function (PF). Fusion grading was assessed by computed tomography after 1 and 2 years.Forty-eight patients who underwent BSIJF were included, of whom 31 (65%) were women with a mean age of 54 ± 14 years and a mean body mass index of 29 ± 5. Twenty-five patients (52%) had prior lumbar spine surgery (PLSS). One patient required revision for implant malpositioning and nerve impingement. Bridging bone across the sacroiliac joint was observed in 85% of patients. Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores dropped significantly from 7.6 preoperatively to 3.9, 3.3, and 3.7 at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-ups, respectively (P ≤ 0.004). PI and PF scores were significantly improved at all timepoints (all P < 0.001). ODI scores demonstrated sustained improvement from 52.3 preoperatively to 33.3 at 1-year follow-up and 29.3 at 2-year follow-up (P < 0.001). SANE scores were 80% at 1-year follow-up and 85% at 2-year follow-up. PI, PF, and ODI scores were significantly improved at all timepoints, independent of PLSS status. The mean SANE score in patients with PLSS was 82% ± 22% at 2-year follow-up. Patient history of hip surgery prior to BSIJF was associated with inferior postoperative ODI and SANE scores.BSIJF is a safe and effective treatment that is associated with high rates of bony bridging at the sacroiliac joint and long-term clinically significant improvements in pain and function.This manuscript is generously published free of charge by ISASS, the International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery.

The study period was divided into early (2010-2014), mid (2015-2019), and late (2020-2024) eras. The primary outcome was valve reintervention. The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and temporal change in prosthetic valve gradient and clinical indices of disease severity.Overall, 341 patients (age 38±17 years; 175 [51%] males) received 346 prostheses (pulmonary [N=236, 68%], tricuspid [N=75, 22%], aortic [N=22, 8%], and mitral [N=7, 2%]). The prostheses were Sapien (N=181, 52%), Melody (N=142, 41%), and Harmony prostheses (N=23, 7%). The number of transcatheter valve implantations increased from the early era (N=75), mid era (N=109), to the late era (N=162). The 10-year incidence of valve reintervention was 35%, and was similar between Sapien versus Melody prosthesis (41% versus 33%; P=0.11). The 10-year incidence of all-cause mortality was 13%. There was a temporal increase in prosthetic valve Doppler mean gradient (baseline versus 10 years) for pulmonary (12±5 versus 28±11 mmHg; P<0.001), tricuspid (3±1 versus 8±3 mmHg; P<0.001), and aortic prosthesis (13±5 versus 26±12 mmHg; P<0.001). There was a temporal increase in predicted peak oxygen consumption (absolute ∆, 9% [95% CI, 4-13]; P=0.006) and a decrease in NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) level (absolute ∆, -138 pg/mL [95% CI, -209 to -64]; P<0.001) at 1-year postintervention.There has been a temporal increase in the number of transcatheter valve implantations over time. Transcatheter valve replacement was associated with clinical improvement across multiple domains. However, there was a significant increase in prosthetic valve gradient within 10 years of follow-up, suggesting limited prosthesis longevity. There is a need for strategies to improve prosthetic valve longevity, which in turn may improve outcomes in this population.",Circulation.

41143601,Cell-Of-Origin Subtype Predicts Response to Polatuzumab Vedotin in Large B Cell Lymphoma.,"Polatuzumab vedotin (polatuzumab) was approved for upfront treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (Pola-R-CHP) based on the POLARIX trial. However, when stratified by cell-of-origin (COO), polatuzumab appears to have greater efficacy in activated B-cell (ABC) than germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype. Most studies of polatuzumab used RNA expression to assess COO, whereas, in routine clinical practice the immunohistochemistry-based Hans algorithm is used.To assess the impact of COO by immunohistochemistry on polatuzumab efficacy, we conducted a multicenter real-world study of adults with LBCL receiving polatuzumab from 2015-2024, split by receipt of polatuzumab in frontline versus relapsed/refractory settings. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) to polatuzumab-based treatment in GCB versus non-GCB relapsed/refractory LBCL.Of 740 patients, 305 received polatuzumab in the frontline and 435 in the relapsed/refractory setting. In the relapsed/refractory cohort, ORR in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL was 59.7% versus 36.3% (OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.77-3.84, p<0.0001), with complete response rate (CRR) of 35.7% versus 17.7% (OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.66-4.02, p<0.0001). Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer for patients with non-GCB versus GCB COO (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.5-0.83, p=0.0006). In the frontline cohort, ORR, CRR, and PFS were similar in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL, as hypothesized based on outcomes in the Pola-R-CHP arm of POLARIX, suggesting addition of polatuzumab overcomes the adverse risk of non-GCB COO in patients receiving R-CHOP.Based on these data, COO classification by Hans algorithm is a strong predictor of polatuzumab efficacy in LBCL, informing real-world treatment decisions.",Clin Cancer Res,"Oct 27, 2025",2025,Oct,27,Scheffer Cliff E R|Pelaez G D|Wan F|Iyengar V|Zhou J|Chung K|Abdel-Razeq N|Allen J|Major A|Sharp J|Epperla N|Gould P|Cherng H J|Houshyar S|Wallace D S|Lynch R C|Kallam A|Mei M G|Merryman R W|Fleyshman M|Rhodes J M|Kidwell A|Fenske T S|Malakhov N|Mulvey E|Watkins M P|Alhaj Moustafa M|Hilal T|Nowakowski G S|Wang Y|Torka P|Russler-Germain D A,Chung K|Abdel-Razeq N|Houshyar S|Wallace D S|Alhaj Moustafa M|Hilal T|Nowakowski G S|Wang Y,"Peter Maccallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.|Washington University in St. Louis, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, United States.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.|ShenZhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.|Mayo Clinic, United States.|University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.|University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, United States.|James Cancer Hospital, Columbus, OH, United States.|Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.|Columbia University, United States.|University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.|University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.|City Of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, United States.|Rutgers Cancer Institute, United States.|Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.|Medical College of Wisconsin, United States.|Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.|Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States.","Scheffer Cliff E R, Pelaez G D, Wan F, Iyengar V, Zhou J, Chung K, Abdel-Razeq N, Allen J, Major A, Sharp J, Epperla N, Gould P, Cherng H J, Houshyar S, Wallace D S, Russler-Germain D A, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41143601/,This research explores how the type of cancer cell that gives rise to a type of blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can affect how well a new drug called polatuzumab vedotin works.

The authors aimed to compare in-person versus livestream CME using outcomes of learner engagement and perceived teaching effectiveness and evaluate the relationship between learner digital proficiency, learner engagement, and teaching effectiveness in livestream CME.A nonrandomized comparison study was performed at a CME course in January to February 2022. Participants self-selected in-person or livestream modality. Measurements included the Learner Engagement Inventory, CME Teaching Effectiveness instrument completed after each presentation (score range 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree [favorable]), and the Pew Digital Savviness Classifier (ie, digital proficiency) self-reported at baseline. Analyses accounted for repeated measures by participants.Two hundred twenty-eight attendees consented to participate (172 in-person and 56 livestream) and submitted 6010 responses across 37 presentations. Learner engagement and teaching effectiveness were not significantly different between in-person and livestream CME (Learner Engagement Inventory mean 4.58 versus 4.63; difference -0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.15 to 0.05, P = .33 and CME Teaching Effectiveness 4.70 versus 4.66; difference 0.04; 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.14; P = .46). In the livestream group, participants with low versus high self-reported digital proficiency reported similar learner engagement (4.52 versus 4.42, difference 0.09 [95% CI: -0.24 to 0.43, P =.58) and teaching effectiveness (4.60 versus 4.53, difference 0.08 [95% CI: -0.23 to 0.38), P = .62).Learner engagement and teaching effectiveness were not statistically different between in-person and livestream CME modalities, and digital proficiency did not influence this relationship.

To address response dynamics and the impact of measurable residual disease (MRD), we analyzed prospectively collected plasma samples from 56 study patients using the EuroClonality immunoglobulin gene (IG)-NGS assay. At baseline, disease-related clonotypes were identified in 50/56 (89%) patients by IG-NGS in cell-free (cf)DNA and/or FFPE samples. MRD markers were successfully identified in 49/52 (94%) cfDNA samples and 35/41 (85%) FFPE samples. Baseline cfDNA and circulating tumor (ct)DNA levels correlated with preclinical risk factors, and high cfDNA levels ≥3.35 log10hGE/ml plasma were significantly associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio (HR): 3.1). ctDNA clearance was rapid with 52% of patients MRD-negative at C2D1, 83% patients at C4D1, and 82% patients after finishing six 21-day cycles (end of treatment (EOT)) and a sustained treatment response (93% MRD negative) six months after EOT. ctDNA detection was associated with worse PFS outcomes at C2D1 (p = 0.039, HR:4.51, 95%Cl:0.93-21.74), C4D1 (p = 0.07, HR:3.34, 95%Cl:0.83-13.48) and EOT (p = 0.01, HR:6.38, 95%Cl:1.27-32.01) and inferior overall survival at these time points.

A total of 2142 MRI features were extracted, and relevant features were selected to create predictive models for optic nerve and choroidal invasion.Among 31 eyes of 29 patients, 14 eyes had optic nerve invasion and 6 had choroidal invasion. The predictive model for optic nerve (ON) invasion achieved Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (accuracy 0.84, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.76) using the radiomic features of maximum 2D diameter slice on the unaffected optic nerve (ON), correlation of grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) on the affected ON, and kurtosis of affected ON. For choroidal invasion the model achieved AUROC of 0.86 (accuracy 0.94, sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.96) using the radiomic features of sphericity of affected vitreous and surface volume ratio of affected ON.Radiomics could be useful to guide the decision of globe salvage versus enucleation in advanced retinoblastoma.

41145855,The Use of Poly-4-Hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) Scaffold in Cosmetic Breast Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The P4HB scaffold (GalaFLEX) is an effective tool in breast reconstruction, but its role in cosmetic breast procedures, such as mastopexy, requires further evaluation. We performed a proportions meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of P4HB scaffold use in aesthetic breast surgery.A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase through December 2024 for studies on cosmetic breast surgery using the P4HB scaffold that reported safety and efficacy outcomes. A random-effects model and Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation were applied. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2.Three studies with 406 female patients (average age 39) were included, with mastopexy and augmentation-mastopexy being the most common procedures. Pooled analysis showed a delayed wound healing rate of 5.94 per 100 (95% CI: 0.34-16.62%), recurrent implant malposition at 0.47 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-1.58%), infection at 0.42 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-2.47%), seroma at 0.31 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-1.32%), recurrent capsular contracture at 0.18 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-1.21%), scaffold palpability at 0.11 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-0.93%), and red breast syndrome at 0.00 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-1.22%).This meta-analysis suggests that the P4HB scaffold may be a valuable adjunct in aesthetic breast procedures, potentially reducing complications such as implant malposition and capsular contracture, while showing low rates of other complications including delayed wound healing, infection, and seroma.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The researchers conducted a large-scale genetic analysis, examining millions of DNA variations across the human genome in over 40,000 individuals, both with and without bipolar disorder. By closely examining specific regions of the genome, they were able to pinpoint several genes that appear to play a key role in increasing a person"
41146403,"GRADE-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Emergency Department Delirium Risk Stratification, Screening, and Brain Imaging in Older Patients With Suspected Delirium.","This portion of the Geriatric Emergency Department (GED) Guidelines 2.0 focuses on delirium in the emergency department (ED).A multidisciplinary group applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations related to older ED patients with possible delirium.The GED Guidelines 2.0 Delirium Work Group derived six evidence-based recommendations for risk stratification, diagnosis, and brain imaging. To reduce universal screening, the Delirium Risk Score may be used to identify older adults at low risk for delirium, though the evidence certainty is very low. In adults over 65 admitted to ED observation units, Zucchelli's risk assessment tool (threshold ≥ 4) may stratify delirium risk, also with very low certainty. For adults over 75, the REDEEM Score may be used to identify low- or high-risk individuals, again with very low certainty. For diagnosis, 4AT, bCAM, CAM-ICU, mCAM, AMT-4, or RASS may be used to rule delirium in or out, based on very low certainty. The Delirium Triage Screen (DTS) may be used to rule out, but not to rule in, delirium, also with very low certainty. For diagnostic imaging, there is very low certainty of evidence to recommend for or against obtaining a head CT as part of the evaluation for older ED patients with delirium. All recommendations are conditional, reflecting very low certainty of evidence due to the lack of high-quality ED-based studies and comparative effectiveness research.Rigorous ED-based research is needed to strengthen evidence and guide delirium care for older adults in geriatric emergency medicine.© 2025 The Author(s).
