41253179,Prospective clinical trial analyzing serum mast cell tryptase levels and arthrofibrosis rates after total knee arthroplasty.,"Arthrofibrosis affects a notable percentage of patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Elevated serum mast cell tryptase (SMCT) levels have been linked to fibrosis, suggesting that SMCT could serve as a biomarker for arthrofibrosis. As such, the aims of this study were to assess SMCT levels in TKA patients, and their possible association with arthrofibrosis and clinical outcomes in a prospective clinical trial.We conducted a prospective study involving 219 patients undergoing primary TKA at a single academic medical centre between January 2018 and December 2022. SMCT levels were measured preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at six weeks, three months, and one year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included revision rates, complications, and Knee Society Scores (KSSs). Allergic and inflammatory conditions were assessed for their influence on SMCT levels.At one year postoperatively, eight patients had developed arthrofibrosis (4%), and three (1.5%) had undergone manipulation under anaesthesia. The mean preoperative SMCT level was 5.6 µg/L (SD 3.4), which decreased significantly to 4.1 µg/L (SD 2.7) immediately postoperatively (p < 0.001). At six weeks the mean SMCT level was 6.4 µg/l (SD 4.1), and was 6.1 µg/l at both three months (SD 4.1) and one year (SD 4.0). Elevated preoperative SMCT levels were not significantly associated with the risk of arthrofibrosis development (OR 3; p = 0.370), nor were immediate postoperative levels (OR 2; p = 0.754) or those at six weeks (OR 1; p = 0.989). Of note, elevated SMCT levels at three months (OR 5; 95% CI 0.4 to 64; p = 0.191) and one year (OR 13; 95% CI 1 to 232; p = 0.077) trended toward an increased risk of arthrofibrosis development, without reaching significance.In patients undergoing TKA, with the numbers included in this study, there was no significant difference in SMCT levels between patients who did and did not develop arthrofibrosis at any timepoint. However, there was a trend towards elevated SMCT levels at three months and one year in those who developed arthrofibrosis, which merits further study.© 2025 Meissner et al.",Bone & joint research,"Nov 19, 2025",2025,Nov,19,Meissner N|Tibbo M E|Larson D R|Morrey M E|Sanchez-Sotelo J|Hannon C P|Berry D J|Abdel M P,Meissner N|Tibbo M E|Larson D R|Morrey M E|Sanchez-Sotelo J|Hannon C P|Berry D J|Abdel M P,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Meissner N, Tibbo M E, Larson D R, Morrey M E, Sanchez-Sotelo J, Hannon C P, Berry D J, Abdel M P",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41253179/,"This study examined the relationship between serum mast cell tryptase (SMCT) levels and the development of arthrofibrosis (scarring) after total knee replacement surgery.

41254255,Diagnostic performance of X-ray-based deep learning models for detecting ankle and foot fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lower extremity fractures are prevalent in vulnerable populations leading to significant burdens, which highlight the need for timely and precise diagnosis. Integrating deep learning with imaging findings has shown promising results for enhancing fracture detection accuracy. This study assesses the diagnostic accuracy of AI models using X-ray images to detect ankle and foot fractures and investigates the probable factors influencing their performance.A comprehensive search of four databases was done up to September 30th, 2025. Studies that investigated the accuracy of deep learning models for the detection of ankle and foot fractures utilizing X-rays were included. A bivariate random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis.A total of 506 studies were reviewed, and 14 were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of all the representative models of the included studies had a cumulative sensitivity and specificity of 93.2% and 94.5% (95% CI 88.8-95.9%, 90.1-97.0%, respectively, I2 6.6%). The pooled F1 score was estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.97). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in the sensitivity or specificity of studies using multi-view vs. single-view X-rays (P = 0.64, P = 0.89, respectively). Models detecting calcaneal fractures performed significantly better than models detecting foot or ankle fractures, with a pooled sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 93.0-96.6%, P = 0.008), specificity of 98.3% (95% CI 97.00-99.0%), and a DOR of 1751.8 (95% CI 445.9-6882.5). The type of dataset used (validation vs. test, internal testing vs. external testing) did not significantly affect performance.Deep learning models can be considered a notably accurate method for the detection of ankle and foot fractures. Further studies with larger samples, external validation, and clinical implementations are required.This systematic review and meta-analysis study was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42024624044.© 2025.

41091083,Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients With Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction: The Underlying Role of Visceral Adiposity.,"It has been hypothesized that an impairment of kidney function may contribute to the development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the conventional threshold for the identification of intrinsic renal disease in HFpEF (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) does not consider age-related physiological changes. When adjusted for age, the appropriate threshold is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, leading to a prevalence of impaired glomerular function of ≈15% to 25% among patients with HFpEF. However, even this estimate of chronic kidney disease is inflated, since heart failure and its treatments lead to reversible changes in renal perfusion, renal venous pressures, and intrarenal hemodynamic changes, which do not reflect structural kidney disease. Accordingly, the risk of end-stage kidney disease in patients with HFpEF is exceptionally low, ie, <0.5% annually, far lower than the risk of death. It is generally assumed that hypertension and diabetes are the most important modifiable risk factors for the development of kidney disease in patients with HFpEF. However, in large-scale trials, pharmacological efforts to lower blood pressure or blood glucose have not had favorable effects on glomerular function or the risk of end-stage kidney disease. Instead, the principal driver of chronic kidney disease in patients with HFpEF appears to be obesity and visceral adiposity. Both obesity and visceral adiposity are accompanied by neurohormonal activation and imbalances in adipokine secretion that are established causal mechanisms-not only of HFpEF-but also of glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis-actions that are potentially augmented by increases in the mass of adipose tissue surrounding the kidneys. Alleviation of obesity and visceral adiposity with the use of bariatric surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduces the risk of both HFpEF and major adverse kidney outcomes. The sodium avidity and systemic inflammation seen in patients with HFpEF are not attributable to the presence of intrinsic renal disease, but are likely related to neurohormonal and adipokine-mediated pathways that are driven by secretions from an expanded fat mass. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that visceral adiposity is not only the primer driver of HFpEF, but it is also the principal determinant of its association with chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

39357888,Braids and beyond: a comprehensive study on pipeline device braid stability from PREMIER data.,"The pipeline embolization device (PED) has been increasingly used to treat brain aneurysms; however, concerns have been raised about braid stability with newer drawn filled tubing technology devices.To evaluate braid stability of PED early generations using data from the PREMIER trial.All consecutive intracranial aneurysms treated with PED (Classic and Flex) within the PREMIER trial were reviewed for braid stability (fish mouthing, foreshortening, braid bump, braid collapsing). Immediate postprocedure cone-beam CT and angiography were compared with 1- and 2- years' follow-up. Analyses included safety, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, including +1 mRS point and a good clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2), vessel stenosis ≥50%, effectiveness measured with Raymond-Roy Scale, and re-treatment rates.133/141 aneurysms had a complete dataset. 8/133 (6%) aneurysms showed braid deformations. Inter-reader agreement was excellent (κ=0.83). Braid deformations were statistically significantly associated with in-stent vessel stenosis >50% (P=0.029), without impact on effectiveness or safety. Fish mouthing was found in 1/133 (0.75%) at 1 year, causing >50% vessel stenosis. Foreshortening occurred in 6/133 (4.5%), and braid bump in 1/133 (0.75%) associated with severe in-stent stenosis. Four other cases (3.0%) of asymptomatic in-stent stenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia were seen without braid changes. No new braid stability deformations were found at the 2-year follow-up.Our study demonstrates excellent braid stability among patients treated with the PED Classic and Flex in the PREMIER trial. Within the uncommon braid changes observed, none affected the PED safety or efficacy.NCT02186561.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

39366733,Comparing stand-alone endovascular embolization versus stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III: a propensity score matched study.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon cerebral lesions that can cause significant neurological complications. Surgical resection is the gold standard for treatment, but endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are viable alternatives.To compare the outcomes of endovascular embolization versus SRS in the treatment of AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III.This study combined retrospective data from 10 academic institutions in North America and Europe. Patients aged 1 to 90 years who underwent endovascular embolization or SRS for AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III between January 2010 and December 2023 were included.The study included 244 patients, including 84 who had endovascular embolization and 160 who had SRS. Before propensity score matching (PSM), complete obliteration at the last follow-up was achieved in 74.5% of the SRS group compared with 57.8% of the embolization group (OR=0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.48; P=0.01). After propensity score matching, SRS still achieved significantly higher occlusion rates at last follow-up (78.9% vs 55.3%; OR=0.32; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90; P=0.03).Hemorrhagic complications were higher in the embolization group than in the SRS group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance after PSM (13.2% vs 2.6%; OR=5.6; 95% CI 0.62 to 50.47; P=0.12). Similarly, re-treatment rate was higher in the embolization group (10.5% vs 5.3%; OR=2.11; 95% CI 0.36 to 12.31; P=0.40) compared with the SRS group.Our findings indicate that SRS has a significantly higher obliteration rate at last follow-up compared with endovascular embolization. Also, SRS has a higher tendency for fewer hemorrhagic complications and lower re-treatment rate. Further prospective studies are needed.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. No commercial re-use.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the predictive value of TCD parameters following successful MT (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3).In July 2024, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, to identify observational studies in which TCD parameters were measured within 48 hours of MT. Using random-effects models, we compared four TCD parameters (mean flow velocity (MFV), MFV index, pulsatility index (PI), and peak systolic velocity (PSV) among groups with vs without hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and favorable vs poor functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 vs 3-6).Eleven studies comprising 1432 patients (59% male; mean age range: 63-73 years) were included. The MFV and MFV index were higher in patients with HT (Hedges' g=0.42 and 0.54, P=0.015 and 0.005, respectively). Patients with MFV index ≥1.3 showed a higher risk of all HT (RR 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.03, P=0.002), symptomatic HT (RR 4.68; 95% CI 1.49 to 14.65, P=0.008), and poor functional status at 90 days (RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.14, P=0.029), respectively. There was no difference in mean PSV (P=0.1) and PI (P=0.3) among groups with and without HT.This study underscores the prognostic value of the MFV index in predicting HT, symptomatic HT, and poor functional recovery after successful MT in the anterior circulation. Large-scale, multi-center studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to validate the MFV index as a reliable predictor for improving post-thrombectomy care.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with chronic hypoPT had higher risk of valvular heart disease [hazard ratio (HR) 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-2.60], peripheral artery disease (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.41-2.26), heart failure (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.44-1.90), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.38-1.81), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.05-1.64), and fatal cardiovascular disease (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.40-1.80) compared to matched controls. No significant difference in risk of stroke/TIA was observed. Cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between patients with surgical and nonsurgical chronic hypoPT. Females with hypoPT had a significantly increased risk of valvular heart disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and fatal cardiovascular disease compared to female controls. There were no differences in any cardiovascular outcomes between males with hypoPT and male controls.The risk of cardiovascular diseases was increased in patients with chronic hypoPT, particularly among women.

40960442,Is Type 2 Diabetes a Modifiable Risk Factor for the Evolution and Progression of Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but it is not clear whether this metabolic disorder is causal or represents a modifiable risk factor. Mechanisms by which diabetes may be associated with HFpEF can be grouped into the following: 1) those related to hyperglycemia and amenable to antihyperglycemic drugs; and 2) those related to the association of type 2 diabetes with obesity and visceral adiposity, and thus, treatable with interventions that reduce adipose tissue mass or improve adipocyte biology.Experimentally, acute and chronic hyperglycemia caused by islet cell destruction can lead to cardiac dysfunction, but these models resemble type 1 (not type 2) diabetes. Heightened levels of environmental glucose can cause enzymatic or nonenzymatic modification of proteins and signaling through the polyol pathway, but interference with these mechanisms has not produce clinical benefits in patients with heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, lowering of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes with insulin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones has not reduced the risk of heart failure.In marked contrast, experimental models that link type 2 diabetes to HFpEF are typically accompanied by excess adiposity. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the association between type 2 diabetes and HFpEF is mediated primarily through a common link with central obesity and an expanded visceral fat mass. Changes in the biology of adipocytes as a result of visceral adiposity are sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and diabetes. Interestingly, the primary metabolic defect in the diabetic heart is lipid overload, not an impairment in glucose uptake or insulin resistance. Adiposity can promote HFpEF through the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines that lead to sodium retention and cardiac steatosis and fibrosis. Additionally, excess adiposity can drive the production of and enhance cardiac sensitivity to advanced glycation end products. Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter reduce the risk or progression of HFpEF, but this benefit is not related by the presence of diabetes or to the glucose-lowering effects of these drugs. Instead, their favorable cardiac effects may be mediated by their action to induce or mimic a state of caloric deprivation, thus restoring adipokine balance and alleviating the state of cardiac steatosis. Similarly, bariatric surgery alleviates both visceral adiposity and type 2 diabetes and reduces the risk of HFpEF.Taken together, these findings suggest that diabetes-associated HFpEF is mediated primarily through its association with excess adiposity. Diabetes is a modifiable risk factor if treatment is directed toward adiposity rather than hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41031977,Central Adiposity or Hypertension: Which Drives Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"The 2 most prevalent risk factors for the development of heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are hypertension and obesity, but their relative importance in driving the evolution and progression of HFpEF has not been critically evaluated. The role of excess adiposity in HFpEF has been substantially underappreciated, largely because of reliance on body mass index (rather than waist-to-height ratio) to identify an expanded fat mass and on a meaningful elevation of natriuretic peptides to identify HFpEF. In the general population, changes in central obesity and visceral adiposity are observed years before HFpEF becomes clinically manifest, and central obesity is present in >80% to 90% of patients with established HFpEF, with the degree of adiposity being strongly related to the hemodynamic and clinical severity of HFpEF. Therapeutic amelioration of excess adiposity by bariatric surgery or incretin-based drugs appears to have substantial effects on the evolution and progression of HFpEF, with reported reductions of 40% to 60% in the risk of heart failure hospitalizations. Hypertension also increases the risk of heart failure, but in Mendelian randomization studies, HFpEF is more strongly linked to obesity than to hypertension. Furthermore, the available evidence from clinical trials does not support a consistent link between blood pressure lowering and a reduced risk of HFpEF, particularly in patients with coexisting obesity. Although a history of hypertension is exceptionally prevalent among patients with established HFpEF, in trials of patients with established HFpEF, drugs that lowered systolic blood pressure by 3 to 7 mm Hg yielded a heart failure event risk reduction of only 5% to 18%. Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed benefit on heart failure events was not related to the elevation of baseline systolic blood pressure or the magnitude of the drug-related decreases in blood pressure. Adiposity causes hypertension, and if excess adiposity is not alleviated, blood pressure lowering with many antihypertensive drugs may not be able to alleviate left ventricular systolic and diastolic and vascular stiffness. Taken together, the totality of evidence suggests that-in the current era-central adiposity appears to be more important than hypertension as a determinant of the evolution and progression of HFpEF.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41225295,Socioeconomic status and concussion recovery in young athletes.,"Socioeconomic status (SES) may be associated with time to return to play (RTP) after sport-related concussion (SRC), but the literature is limited and has yielded mixed results. The purpose of our study was to determine the association between SES and concussion recovery in high school and middle school athletes.High school and middle school athletes from 24 schools in southeast Minnesota who sustained a SRC between 2020 and 2023 were included in this study. Data obtained for each concussion included date of injury and date of clearance to complete a RTP protocol. A validated measure of SES, HOUSES (HOUsing-based index of SES), was used to determine SES by pairing home addresses to publicly available property data. SES was divided into four quartiles determined for the region (Q1 = lowest SES quartile, Q4 = highest SES quartile). A negative-bimodal regression model was used to analyze the relationship between SES and RTP time.A total of 132 athletes (mean age 15.9 ± 1.5 years, 75.0% male) were included in the study. Among the total cohort, median RTP time was 12.0 days. Within each HOUSES quartile, median RTP time was 16 days in Q1, 12 days in Q2, 13 days in Q3, and 11 days in Q4. After adjusting for sex, race, ethnicity, and prior diagnosis of migraines, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, and mood disorder, athletes were estimated to have 23.9% fewer recovery days for each 1-unit increase in HOUSES quartile (p < 0.001).RTP time after concussion may be related to SES in young athletes, with higher SES associated with shorter RTP timelines.",The Physician and sportsmedicine,"Nov 18, 2025",2025,Nov,18,Kreitner L A|Crowley E M|Hentz R C|Wi C I|Soma D B,Kreitner L A|Crowley E M|Hentz R C|Wi C I|Soma D B,"Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Orthopedics - Division of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences - Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic,Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Community Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Kreitner L A, Crowley E M, Hentz R C, Wi C I, Soma D B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41225295/,This study found that young athletes from higher socioeconomic backgrounds had shorter recovery times after a concussion compared to those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

41251650,Ambient Artificial Intelligence Versus Human Scribes in the Emergency Department.,"To compare the use of ambient artificial intelligence (AI) versus human scribes in the emergency department in terms of note quality and time spent in the electronic health record.A quality improvement pilot was performed with 5 early adopters from December 2024 to January 2025. Physicians were assigned to a human or AI scribe. Two physicians, blinded to the chart's origin, scored notes using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). We accessed our electronic health record for time metrics and note contributions and compared PDQI-9 scores, time metrics, and note contribution between groups.There were 710 visits, 284 with human scribes (123 adult and 161 pediatric) and 426 with AI-assisted charting (271 adult, 155 pediatric). PDQI-9 scores were similar for adults, but AI scribes scored lower for pediatric patients (41.36 versus 42.25, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = -1.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.58 to -0.20]). More time in the electronic health record notes section per patient was spent when using AI scribes (adult: 4.3 versus 1.8 minutes, aRR = 2.38 [95% CI 1.85 to 3.05]; pediatric: 3.5 versus 1.6 minutes, aRR = 2.21 [95% CI 1.94 to 2.51]). Note length was similar but physicians contributed significantly more characters per note when using AI (adult: 60.1% versus 30.8%, adjusted mean differences = 32.9 [95% CI 20.8 to 45.0]; pediatric: 62.3% versus 27.1%, adjusted mean differences = 35.2 [95% CI 29.7 to 40.7]).In comparison to human scribes, AI scribes were associated with more time spent in the electronic health record notes section, more physician note contribution, and similar to lower quality notes.Copyright © 2025 American College of Emergency Physicians.

41254208,Uncertainty-aware large language models for explainable disease diagnosis.,"Explainable disease diagnosis, which leverages patient information (e.g., symptoms) and computational models to generate probable diagnoses and reasoning, holds strong clinical promise. Yet, when clinical notes lack sufficient evidence for a definitive diagnosis, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty commonly arises, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Despite its importance, the explicit identification and explanation of diagnostic uncertainty remain under-explored in artificial intelligence-driven systems. To fill this gap, we introduce ConfiDx, an uncertainty-aware large language model fine-tuned with diagnostic criteria. We formalized the task of uncertainty-aware diagnosis and curated richly annotated datasets that reflect varying degrees of diagnostic ambiguity. Evaluating on real-world datasets demonstrated that ConfiDx excelled in identifying diagnostic uncertainties, achieving superior diagnostic performance, and generating trustworthy explanations for diagnoses and uncertainties. Moreover, ConfiDx-assisted experts outperformed standalone experts by 10.7% in uncertainty recognition and 26% in uncertainty explanation, underscoring its substantial potential to improve clinical decision-making.© 2025.

39304195,Improved technical outcomes with converting thrombectomy techniques after failed first pass recanalization.,"A higher number of recanalization attempts reduces the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion (LVO). We assessed the impact of switching EVT techniques after a failed first pass on procedural and clinical outcomes.This multicenter international study, conducted between January 2013 and December 2022, included patients undergoing EVT for anterior circulation LVO (internal carotid artery or M1 segments) with failed first pass recanalization. Propensity score matching identified a 1:1 matched cohort of patients in whom EVT technique was changed after a failed first pass and those with the same technique repeated. The primary outcome was successful recanalization at second attempt defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) score of 2B or higher. Secondary outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Score (mRS) and postprocedural hemorrhage.Among 2167 patients, converting to an alternative technique after a failed first pass was associated with higher odds of successful recanalization (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.5, p=0.041), and higher odds of mRS 0-2 at 90 days (aOR=1.6, p=0.005) without additional risk of symptomatic hemorrhage (p=0.379). Using a propensity score matched cohort of 490 patients, technique conversion at second attempt increased odds of successful recanalization at second attempt (aOR=1.32, p=0.006) and 90-day mRS 0-2 (aOR=1.38, p=0.008).Early conversion to an alternative EVT technique after a failed first pass recanalization in patients with AIS is associated with better technical success and clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.
