41347395,Effects of Sex and Obesity on Lipid Metabolism During Low Intensity Exercise and Post-Exercise Period.,"Whether there are sex- and obesity-differences in fat oxidation and free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization during low intensity exercise is unclear.We studied 21 (9 females) participants without and 24 (16 females) with obesity during 5 hours of treadmill walking (~2 mph). We measured energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) and FFA-palmitate kinetics and oxidation with isotopic palmitate infusions ([U- 13 C]palmitate, and [1- 14 C]palmitate or [9,10- 3 H]palmitate). Skeletal muscle samples were collected at 1.5 and 5 hours of exercise and 24 hours after exercise. We calculated fatty acid (FA) oxidation, palmitate rate of disappearance (Rd), and intramyocellular triglyceride (imTG)-derived palmitate fractions during exercise.At rest, EE was 1.24 ± 0.23 kcal/min, with FA oxidation contributing 49 ± 13% of total EE. During exercise, FA oxidation accounted for 73 ± 8% of EE, and was not different between males and females (p = 0.34). Plasma FFA-palmitate concentrations were greater in females than males (p = 0.003), mean palmitate Rd and plasma palmitate clearance were not different (p = 0.32 and 0.14, respectively). Plasma FFA-palmitate Rd was correlated with EE (r = 0.49, p = 0.001), with a proportionally greater Rd response in females (p < 0.001). Although absolute plasma FFA-palmitate oxidation rates were comparable between sexes, the percent contribution of FFA-palmitate oxidation to EE was greater in females (p = 0.001). During exercise, imTG-palmitate fraction amounts remained stable.Lipid oxidation during low-intensity exercise is similar in males and females, independent of obesity, although next-day values were greater in participants with normal weight. Energy expenditure correlates with plasma palmitate disappearance rates, but is proportionally greater in females. Contribution of plasma palmitate oxidation is greater in females than in males during low intensity exercise.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,"Dec 08, 2025",2025,Dec,08,Costa D N|Jensen M D,Costa D N|Jensen M D,"Mayo Clinic, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Rochester, MN.|University of Maryland Midtown Campus, Internal Medicine, Baltimore, MD.","Costa D N, Jensen M D",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41347395/,"This study found that during low-intensity exercise, lipid oxidation is similar in men and women, regardless of obesity. However, women have higher plasma free fatty acid levels and a greater contribution of plasma fatty acid oxidation to their overall energy expenditure compared to men.

41354970,Physical and Occupational Therapist Evaluations for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department: A Geriatric ED Guidelines 2.0 Systematic Review.,"Older adults are at high risk for severe injuries and death from falls. Physical therapist (PT) and occupational therapist (OT) evaluations have been introduced into Emergency Department (ED) care to assist with fall risk evaluation and fall prevention care. An evaluation of current evidence was undertaken to inform the Geriatric ED Guidelines 2.0.Systematic review of physical and/or occupational therapy evaluation for fall prevention in the ED. The intervention was evaluation by a rehabilitation therapist (PT, OT, or both) for fall prevention, fall assessment, or mitigation of fall risk factors. Studies that did not perform the evaluation during the ED or ED Observation Unit visit were excluded, such as referrals for home consultation. The published literature was searched using strategies created by a medical librarian and was implemented in Embase and PubMed in March 2025. Covidence was used for article collation and review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias v2 and the Ottawa-Newcastle scale.The search resulted in 387 articles with 52 duplicates, for 335 unique citations. Ten articles on 6 datasets were included (4 abstracts and 6 published manuscripts). One article was at high risk of bias as very few intervention patients received therapist evaluation. The remaining 5 datasets had varied co-interventions in addition to PT and/or OT evaluations. PT or OT evaluation in the ED was associated with reduced ED revisits at 1, 2, and 6 months. Evaluations in the ED were not associated with increased hospital admission rates or ED length of stay. A meta-analysis was infeasible due to varied outcome timeframes.PT and/or OT evaluations for fall prevention were associated with reduced subsequent ED revisits for older adults. However, the impact of co-interventions and heterogeneity limits strong conclusions.© 2025 The Author(s).

41353737,A new validated staging system for AL amyloidosis with Stage IIIC defining ultra-poor risk: AL International Staging System (AL-ISS).,"Outcomes in systemic AL amyloidosis have improved with modern therapy limiting utility of existing risk stratification models. We validate a new staging system, incorporating longitudinal strain (LS) to the biomarker-based (NT-proBNP and Troponin-T) staging system in the contemporary treatment era (2015-2024).AL International Staging System (AL-ISS) was derived from a cohort of patients with AL amyloidosis from the UK National Amyloidosis Centre (2015-2019). The model was validated in patient cohorts from Europe (Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland), USA (2015-2024) and UK (2020-2024).2493 patients were included (derivation, n=573; validation n=1920). In a multivariable model for the derivation cohort, LS≥-9% and cardiac biomarkers at previously validated thresholds (NT-proBNP 332 ng/L and 8500 ng/L and hs-TnT>50 ng/L) were independent poor prognostic factors stratifying patients into stages I, II, IIIA, IIIB and IIIC. In the validation cohort, the patient stages were stage I: 317 (17%), II: 782 (41%), IIIA: 551 (29%), IIIB: 174 (9%) and IIIC: 96 (5%), respectively (first-line daratumumab treated: 826; 43%). With a median follow-up of 34 months, median overall survival (OS) was not reached (NR); estimated 1-year, 2-year and 3-year OS was 82%, 74% and 70% respectively. Median survival for stages I-II, IIIA, IIIB and IIIC were NR, 67, 26 and 7 months (1-year OS IIIC 53% v 68% for IIIB in the daratumumab-treated patients), respectively (p<0.001). External validation exhibited good predictive performance: 12-month calibration slope was 1.09, Harrell's C 0.69, Royston's D 1.19, R2D 0.25.

41353597,Timing for Repair of Urosymphyseal Fistula After Diagnosis Determines the Incidence Postoperative Outcomes.,"There is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing of urosymphyseal fistula (USF) repair. Our aim was to conduct a comparative analysis evaluating the postoperative complications and surgical outcomes among patients undergoing surgery for USF, comparing those treated in an early versus delayed fashion.Fifty-eight patients with diagnosis of USF and who underwent fistula decompression, pubic bone resection, and urinary tract reconstruction were included. Patients who underwent USF repair within 100 days of diagnosis were classified as having early repair, while those treated after 100 days were considered to have delayed repair.Thirty-one underwent delayed USF repair (53.4%), while 27 underwent early repair (46.6%). Most patients were male (96.8%). The median age (72 years vs. 69 years, p = 0.13) and mean BMI (28.7 vs. 28.6, p = 0.97) were comparable between groups. The rate of overall 90-day complications following USF repair was comparable between groups (77.4% vs. 63%, p = 0.228). We did not find a difference between the rates early complications among groups. The rates of long-term recurrent pain (46.7% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.004), recurrent osteomyelitis (20% vs. 0%, p = 0.014), and fistula (23.3% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.033) were higher in the delayed USF repair group compared to the early USF repair group. The follow up time was similar between groups too (25.43-months vs. 32.8-months, p = 0.257).While early USF repair might not affect the incidence of early complications within 90 days post-surgery, it is associated with reduced rates of long-term recurrent pain, recurrent osteomyelitis, and fistula recurrence compared to delayed USF repair.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Journal of surgical oncology,"Dec 07, 2025",2025,Dec,07,Escandón J M|Kreutz-Rodrigues L|Fadel A E|Kemble J P|Paget J T|Houdek M T|Viers B|Bakri K,Escandón J M|Kreutz-Rodrigues L|Fadel A E|Kemble J P|Paget J T|Houdek M T|Viers B|Bakri K,"Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Escandón J M, Kreutz-Rodrigues L, Fadel A E, Kemble J P, Paget J T, Houdek M T, Viers B, Bakri K",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41353597/,"The key finding of this medical research is that early repair of urosymphyseal fistula (within 100 days of diagnosis) is associated with lower rates of long-term complications, such as recurrent pain, osteomyelitis, and fistula recurrence, compared to delayed repair.

41353287,Reproducibility of digital pathology features extracted from deep learning and foundational AI models on sequential tissue slides.,"Numerous deep learning (DL) and foundational models (FMs) designed for digital pathology analysis employ advanced feature extraction techniques from digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides obtained from tissue sections. These extracted features may serve as the input for complex models enabling automated classification tasks, slide searching, and other various medical inferences. Subtle variations in morphology observed in distinct cross sections of the same tissue sample may introduce variability that may be of little to no clinical relevance. The reproducibility of features derived from DL models and FMs on ostensibly identical tissue cross sections remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to characterize the reproducibility of features extracted from three sequential cross sections of 50 independent normal prostate samples. Slides were sectioned at approximately 50 μm intervals and we extracted cell-type specific counts, proportions, and spatial features per slide using DL models, along with feature embeddings from popular digital pathology FMs. Reproducibility of the features across sequential cross sections of tissues was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for DL model features, while extracted FM embedding distributions were evaluated via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein's distance. The median [IQR] ICC estimates for cell-type specific proportion and spatial features from the cross sections was 0.838 [0.764, 0.897], and 0.873 [0.809, 0.923] respectively. The bootstrapped mean differences of ICC estimates for the features were significantly lower (p-value < 0.05) for distant cross sections compared to the two neighboring cross sections. The feature embeddings derived from state-of-the-art digital pathology FMs showed an overall high agreement with the median [IQR] MMD of 0.06 [0.016, 0.169], and median [IQR] Wasserstein's distance of 0.021 [0.011, 0.038]. These findings demonstrate that the features derived from multiple cross sections of the same tissue exhibit overall high reproducibility, while also illustrating the expected increase in intra-sample variability as a function of physical distance between sections.© 2025.

41352976,Comparison of partial breast radiation modalities in women with early-stage breast cancer: a target trial emulation.,"Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is an effective treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, evidence comparing different PBI modalities is limited.This trial emulation uses electronic health records from a multi-state large tertiary health system. Three PBI modalities were compared proton radiation therapy, photon radiation therapy, and applicator-based brachytherapy. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to balance confounders. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR).Between 2013-2023, 1,041 women with early-stage breast cancer were treated with PBI. 1,026 patients were included in the analyses. The median age was 66 years; 22.51% had DCIS, and 97.56% were estrogen receptor positive. With median followup of 38.2 months, the rate of IBR in the overall group was 3.05% (95% CI 1.99-4.65%) at 3 years. After IPW, Compared to photon PBI, the hazard ratio (HR) for IBR for proton PBI was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-6.33), and for brachytherapy, 3.86 (95% CI 1.39-10.69). Compared to proton PBI, the HR for IBR for brachytherapy was 1.83 (95% CI 0.88-3.81). IBR risk was similar across PBI modalities for patients with tumor size ≤ 10 mm and in patients treated for DCIS. Among patients with tumor size >10 mm, the HR for IBR for brachytherapy was 7.64 (95% CI 1.64-35.58) and 3.59 (95% CI 1.22-10.56) relative to photons and protons, respectively.Partial breast irradiation with applicator-based brachytherapy was associated with higher ipsilateral breast recurrence than photon or proton PBI in patients with tumor size > 10 mm, suggesting the need for more careful PBI patient selection for this modality.© The Author(s) 2025.

41351635,Perioperative Continuous Propofol Infusion in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: A 25-Year Retrospective Study.,"In pediatric cardiac critical care, patients often require specific anesthesia and sedation considerations due to unique physiological vulnerabilities. This study assessed the incidence of propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS) in Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PCICU) patients receiving continuous propofol infusion for non-procedural sedation. We conducted a retrospective review of post-operative congenital heart disease patients < 18 years admitted to the PCICU from 1/1/2000-9/30/2024, who received continuous propofol infusions ≥ 12 hours and/or ≥ 2.4 mg/kg/hour. The primary outcome was the incidence of PRIS. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and survival to hospital discharge. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, stratified by physiological complexity (single vs. double ventricle) and surgical mortality risk scores (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery [STAT] score). A total of 641 patients were included. No statistically significant differences in propofol characteristics were found across physiologic or surgical risk groups. The median infusion rate was 1.2 mg/kg/hour, with a median duration of 22.7 hours. No cases of PRIS occurred. Survival to hospital discharge was 97%. The median ICU length of stay was 7.1 days. In this single center, retrospective study of post-operative congenital heart disease patients, continuous propofol infusion was not associated with any cases of PRIS. These findings support the cautious use of propofol in pediatric cardiac critical care. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate safety across the heterogenous congenital heart disease population, including those with single ventricle physiology.© 2025.

41351627,"Non-invasive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy: systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness, safety, and optimal stimulation parameters.","Drug-resistant epilepsy is a common and disabling condition, with few non-surgical treatment options. Non-invasive neurostimulation is an emerging therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy, though evidence is mixed and comparisons between modalities remain challenging. This review systematically appraises and compares the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), low-intensity focused ultrasound (LI-FUS), transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) in drug-resistant epilepsy. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness in seizure reduction (primary outcome), and a meta-regression analysis was conducted to investigate optimal parameters. Sixty-three studies (1342 active participants, 505 controls) were included. At the end of follow-up, pooled mean changes in seizure frequency were: rTMS - 30.2% (95% CI: [- 49.6, - 10.7%]), tDCS - 46.9% (95% CI: [- 66.6, - 27.3%]), and tVNS - 49.2% (95% CI: [- 86.7, - 11.8%]). There was insufficient data to determine effect sizes in tACS, LI-FUS and TNS. Responder rates (percentage of participants with a > 50% decrease in seizure frequency) were: rTMS 38% (95% CI: [24, 51%]), tDCS 49% (95% CI: [32, 66%]), tVNS 29% (95% CI: [7, 50%]), and TNS 42% (95% CI: [24, 60%]); with inadequate data for tACS and LI-FUS. No serious adverse events were reported, and seizure precipitation was rare. rTMS and tDCS demonstrate the strongest evidence for effectiveness, while tVNS and TNS show promise, and tACS and LI-FUS require further study. These findings, while encouraging, should be interpreted in the context of methodological heterogeneity between studies and overall low certainty of evidence.© 2025.

41351430,Learning Anatomy With Radiology: A Systematic Review.,"Radiology education is critical for medical students' anatomical competence and clinical readiness. However, it remains insufficiently integrated in medical curricula as residency program directors describe interns' basic image interpretation as unsatisfactory. This review aims to assess the efficacy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray in facilitating the learning of anatomy among medical students. Following PRISMA guidelines, 983 articles were screened, and 52 studies published between 2000 and 2025 met the inclusion criteria by comparing radiology-integrated anatomy education with traditional methods such as cadaver and atlas use. Data extraction covered study design, radiology modalities, and effect sizes. Both integrated and traditional methods consisted of medical student cohorts assessed on objective knowledge and skills with recorded quantitative outcomes. Included studies showed knowledge gains on multiple choice assessments (pooled Cohen's d = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.34-1.65) but with high heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 99.5%). Controlled designs were used in 21% of studies. Other investigations (68% of studies) used attitudinal surveys that revealed strong student preference for radiology-integrated learning. Of the modalities present, ultrasound was predominant (85% of studies), with other modalities (CT: 15%; MRI/X-ray: < 5%) substantially underrepresented despite clinical relevance. Radiology integration was shown to enhance anatomy education and clinical preparedness. The incorporation of radiology, specifically ultrasound, into anatomical education leads to a significant and substantial improvement in student learning outcomes. Future investigations can standardize assessments, expand multimodal research, and address global curricular disparities.© 2025 The Author(s).
