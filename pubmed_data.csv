41267336,Modeling the acoustic profiles of vocal emotions in American English and Mandarin Chinese.,"This study examined the acoustic profiles of five basic emotions in American English and Mandarin Chinese using a big data approach. A total of 6,373 features were extracted using the openSMILE toolkit, and key discriminative features were identified through random forest classification. In American English, vocal emotions were primarily conveyed through pitch-related features, while Mandarin Chinese, shaped by its tonal constraints, relied more on spectral and voice quality cues, including MFCCs, HNR, and shimmer. Linear mixed-effects models confirmed significant effects of emotion on the top-ranked features, and Cohen's d further supported distinct acoustic profiles for each emotion. K-means clustering revealed both categorical groupings and dimensional overlaps, such as the clustering of high-arousal emotions like happy and surprised, and low-arousal emotions like sad and neutral. These results suggest that vocal emotion expression is shaped by language-specific prosodic systems, as well as by both discrete emotion categories and continuous affective dimensions, supporting an integrated model of emotional prosody.© 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Phonetica,"Nov 24, 2025",2025,Nov,24,Wang F,Wang F,"Department of Neurology, 6915 Mayo Clinic , Rochester, MN 55905, USA.",Wang F,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41267336/,"This study examined how vocal emotions are expressed in American English and Mandarin Chinese.

41276297,Mechanical thrombectomy for cervical artery dissection-related stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a well-established treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, its role in cervical artery dissection-related (CeAD) LVO remains debated due to anatomical complexities and procedural challenges. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of MT in patients with AIS due to CeAD-related LVO compared with other AIS etiologies.PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were systematically searched from inception to March 2025. Comparative observational studies evaluating the use of MT in adult patients with AIS due to LVO were included, specifically those comparing outcomes in patients with CeAD versus non-CeAD etiologies.MT for CeAD-related AIS showed no statistically significant difference in successful recanalization compared with non-CeAD cases (OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.04), P=0.10). However, patients with CeAD-related AIS had significantly higher rates of 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) (OR 2.17 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.05), P<0.01) and lower 90-day mortality (OR 0.34 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.53), P<0.01). Rates of distal embolization (OR 1.60 (95% CI 0.69 to 3.70), P=0.27), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.38), P=0.49), or iatrogenic dissection (OR 1.58 (95% CI 0.59 to 4.22), P=0.36) did not differ significantly between patient groups.MT in patients with CeAD-related LVO is safe, effective, and associated with improved functional outcomes and lower mortality compared with patients with non-CeAD acute ischemic causes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41275393,Lucid Episodes in People with Advanced Dementia: Characterizing caregiver reports to advance definition and measurement of episodes.,"Lucid episodes (LEs) in advanced dementia are characterized by spontaneous, transient recovery of functional abilities. Despite recent increases in research on this previously understudied phenomenon, standard definitional criteria are lacking, presenting challenges for research. Researchers have proposed a preliminary framework to guide uniform labeling and operationalization of salient data elements for investigating LEs and developing definitional criteria. This study leverages this framework to characterize reports of LEs from caregivers and advance their definition and measurement.Family caregivers (N = 259) completed an electronic survey with quantitative and open-ended questions about LEs they witnessed (N = 479 episodes). Respondents were purposively sampled for qualitative interviews. Open-ended question responses (n = 208) and in-depth interviews (n = 24) were analyzed using content analysis.Caregiver descriptions suggest that the content and context of LEs are heterogeneous. Descriptions included observable changes from baseline, with behavior or communication that was distinguishable from routine cognitive fluctuations. LEs were sometimes, but not always specified by logically organized actions; recognition or awareness of people, emotions and surroundings; and insight of their cognitive limitations. Many LEs required deep personal knowledge to attribute it as a meaningful shift.Findings suggest that definitional features may universally specify a significant return of ability with more flexible criteria for how this return manifests in observed actions and domains of recovery (ie, insight, function, and communication). The impact of LEs on observers may be better measured separately, although further research should explore this.© The Author(s) 2025.

41275378,"Comparative clinical and economic outcomes of peritoneal dialysis in urban teaching, urban non-teaching, and rural hospitals in the United States: a nationwide analysis from the national inpatient sample.","Hospital settings may influence outcomes and resource utilization in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, data on PD outcomes across hospital settings remain limited. This study aims to evaluate characteristics, in-hospital treatments, complications, and healthcare costs for PD patients in urban teaching, urban non-teaching, and rural hospitals across the United States.We conducted a cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample database in the United States from 2003 to 2018. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were employed to compare in-hospital treatment outcomes, mortality, and healthcare costs across hospital settings, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics.A total of 99,528 hospitalized ESKD patients receiving PD were included. Among these patients, 60,833 (61%) were in urban teaching hospitals, 32,714 (33%) in urban non-teaching hospitals, and 5,981 (6%) were in rural hospitals. In multivariable analysis, patients in urban non-teaching hospitals had lower risk of PD catheter adjustments (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.97), hyperkalemia (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95), metabolic acidosis (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.78), volume overload (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95), and mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93) but higher risk of PD peritonitis (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.36), and sepsis (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24), compared with urban teaching hospitals. Meanwhile, patients in rural hospitals had a lower risk of metabolic acidosis (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90) and volume overload (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.89) but higher need for hemodialysis (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19), and risk of PD peritonitis (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.24). Urban non-teaching and rural care were associated with lower hospitalization length of stays by 1.5 and 0.5 days and costs by $31632 and $10376, respectively.Rural and urban non-teaching hospitals experienced fewer metabolic complications and less volume overload but faced higher rates of PD-related peritonitis compared to urban teaching hospitals. These findings highlight clinical and economic differences in PD across hospital settings in the United States and crucial strategies for personalizing PD care and optimize resources.

41275369,"Care coordination in screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT): A scoping review.","Implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for substance use in primary care remains challenging. Care coordination (CC) may strengthen SBIRT by supporting brief interventions, improving referral follow-through, and enhancing continuity. CC models and outcomes vary, however, and no prior scoping review has synthesized these.A comprehensive search of 10 resources, including Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, was conducted on 4/15/2025. Eligible studies described outpatient SBIRT models adding CC for any age group. Articles were excluded if they lacked CC, presented no original data, or were not in English. Relevant implementation and patient-level outcomes were extracted to describe CC models and their impact.Of 737 abstracts and 50 full texts reviewed, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Studies spanned primary care, specialty care, and age ranges. CC models included embedded behavioral health providers, centralized linkage managers, and remote coordinators using phone or digital platforms. CC was associated with higher screening completion, brief intervention delivery, referral initiation, and treatment engagement. Successful integration incorporated structured communication, follow-up protocols, and accessible technology. Barriers included limited billing infrastructure, weak electronic record integration, and unclear roles.CC appears to enhance SBIRT implementation and treatment engagement across outpatient settings. Embedded approaches offer relational benefits, while remote and digital strategies show promise for scalability. Comparative studies are needed to assess effectiveness, cost, and contextual fit.Provides the first review of CC models within SBIRT, highlighting their implementation impact and guiding future optimization.© 2025 The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP).",The American journal on addictions,"Nov 23, 2025",2025,Nov,23,Hadani Y|Tarikogullari I|Oesterle T S|McGinnis M T|Nidey N|Lai B|Kalata A H|Sharma P|Bormann N L,Hadani Y|Tarikogullari I|Oesterle T S|McGinnis M T|Lai B|Kalata A H|Sharma P|Bormann N L,"Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Mayo Clinic Libraries, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.|Department of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System, Mayo Clinic, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA.","Hadani Y, Tarikogullari I, Oesterle T S, McGinnis M T, Nidey N, Lai B, Kalata A H, Sharma P, Bormann N L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41275369/,"This study reviewed different models of care coordination (CC) that can be used to improve the implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for substance use in primary care.
