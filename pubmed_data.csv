41092248,Cerebral Blood Flow in Children and Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia.,"Understanding age-related changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF, rate of blood delivery to brain tissue) in sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a prerequisite to incorporating CBF as a marker of brain health. CBF decreases from school-age through adulthood in nonanemic people. In SCA, CBF is generally increased to compensate for anemia, but knowledge of age-related norms is limited. We hypothesized that age-related CBF trajectories differ for SCA vs nonanemic healthy persons: CBF increases from childhood to early adulthood in SCA to compensate for reduced blood oxygen content and then plateaus because of reduced vasodilatory capacity with older age.Children and adults with SCA and race-matched controls (hemoglobin [Hb] AA) aged 6-45 years were enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study from 2014 to 2023 at an academic and community health center. History of overt stroke or arterial stenosis >50% were exclusions. Brain MRIs were performed at 3T with arterial-spin-labeling measurements of gray matter CBF. Regression analyses assessed how age, imaging markers of ischemia, Hb, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) related to CBF.In 192 Black participants with SCA (N = 126; mean age = 18.7 ± 9.0 years, 52.4% female) or without SCA (N = 66; mean age = 22.4 ± 9.7 years, 54.5% female), total Hb was lower in SCA (mean Hb = 8.9 ± 1.3 g/dL) vs control (mean Hb = 13.4 ± 1.5 g/dL) participants (p < 0.001) and did not differ with age in the SCA group. SpO2 was reduced in SCA (median SpO2 = 96%; interquartile range [IQR] = 94-97.4%) vs controls (median SpO2 = 98%, IQR = 97-99%, p < 0.001). In SCA participants, SpO2 was lower in adults (median SpO2 = 95%, IQR = 94%-97%, p = 0.001) compared with children (SpO2 = 96.5%, IQR = 95%-98.2%). Regression analyses, including an interaction between age and group (SCA vs control), showed that CBF increases in SCA by 5.03 mL/100 g/min per decade (95% CI 1.70-8.37) and plateaus at approximately age 30-35 years. In controls, CBF decreased by -5.20 mL/100 g/min per decade (95% CI -8.96 to -1.94).The divergent age dependency of CBF between SCA and non-anemic persons may be explained by a gradient of increasing CBF with age required to compensate for reductions in blood oxygen content in SCA, with possible exhaustion of cerebral vasodilatory abilities in the fourth decade of life.

40472282,Individual response to lifestyle interventions: a pooled analysis of three long-term weight loss trials.,"We explored the manifestations of individual weight loss (WL) response to long-term lifestyle interventions on cardiometabolic risk.We pooled data from three large long-term lifestyle WL-intervention trials: 24-month DIRECT (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00160108; n = 322; 87% adherence), 18-month CENTRAL (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01530724; n = 278; 86% adherence), and 18-month DIRECT PLUS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03020186; n = 294; 89% adherence). We analyzed longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic risk markers, including anthropometrics, blood biomarkers, and magnetic-resonance-imaging-assessed fat depots, and measured DNA-methylation, proteomics, and metabolomics. Among trial completers (n = 761, mean age = 50.4 years; 89% men, baseline body-mass-index = 30.1 kg/m2), mean WL was -3.3 kg (-3.5%). We classified participants as Successful-WL (36%) with relative-WL > 5%, WL-Resistant (28%) who did not lose or gained weight, and Moderate-WL (36%) with WL between 0% and 5%. Successful-WL achieved the greatest improvements in multiple health indicators. However, the WL-Resistant also showed some significant improvements, with increased high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) and decreased leptin and visceral fat (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Overall, each 1 kg sustained lifestyle-induced WL was associated with improvements in lipid markers and insulin resistance [HDLc (+1.44%), triglycerides (-1.37%), insulin (-2.46%), HOMA-IR (-2.71%), leptin (-2.79%)] and intrahepatic-fat regression (-0.49 absolute-units)] and modest but significant change in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (-0.26% and -0.36%). We identified 12 significant methylation sites that are associated with Successful-WL (FDR < 0.05; AUC = 0.73).While only ∼one-third of individuals achieved long-term WL, the Moderate-WL and WL-Resistant individuals could benefit improvements in visceral adiposity and cardiometabolic risk by shifting towards a healthy lifestyle pattern, beyond WL. Site-specific DNA methylation may predict an individual's likelihood of successful WL.NCT00160108, NCT01530724, NCT03020186.© The Author(s) 2025.

40561511,Efficacy and safety of thrombolysis for pediatric venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We conducted this systematic review to evaluate outcomes of thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone in pediatric patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This systematic review addresses mortality, VTE resolution, recurrence, bleeding, and organ-specific outcomes in 5 PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) questions on thrombolysis across pulmonary embolism (PE), extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), right atrial thrombosis (RAT), cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT), and renal vein thrombosis (RVT). Meta-analysis reported risk ratios or differences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]), and absolute effects per 1000 patients. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of recommendation, assessment, Development, and Evaluation) guidelines. Thirteen nonrandomized studies were included and no randomized clinical trials addressed these questions. Thrombolysis might be associated with a higher risk of major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, or unspecified bleeding with risk differences of 0.09 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.23), 0.06 (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.22), and 0.09 (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.23), respectively. In PE with hemodynamic compromise, thrombolysis might be associated with a lower risk of mortality but conclusions on PE progression were uncertain in submassive PE. In DVT, thrombolysis may have little to no effect on mortality or thrombus resolution but might be associated with lower risk of postthrombotic syndrome. In RAT, thrombolysis might have little to no effect on thrombus resolution but a higher risk of major bleeding and mortality. For CSVT and RVT, the evidence was very limited. These findings were based on very-low-certainty evidence because of confounding and imprecision from small sample sizes.

40674706,"High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified: an LLMPP study.","Molecular characterization of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBCL-NOS), is hindered by its rarity, evolving definition, and poor diagnostic reproducibility. To address this challenge, we analyzed 92 HGBCL-NOS tumors collected across Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project sites. Leveraging comparison cohorts of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS (DLBCL-NOS) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and molecular frameworks described in these entities, our analysis revealed a heterogenous molecular landscape, reminiscent of DLBCL-NOS but with an enrichment of BL features. By cell-of-origin classification, 59% were germinal center B-cell-like (GCB), and 25% were activated B-cell-like (ABC). LymphGen, a genetic classifier for DLBCL-NOS, assigned a genetic subtype to 34% of HGBCL-NOS. Although classification rate was lower than in DLBCL-NOS (66%), assigned subtypes spanned the spectrum of LymphGen classes, including 31% of ABCs classified as MCD. Features differentiating HGBCL-NOS from DLBCL-NOS included MYC rearrangement (47% vs 6%); dark zone signature (DZsig) expression (45% vs 7%); and more frequent mutation of ID3, MYC, CCND3, and TP53, all common to BL. A genetic classifier that differentiates DLBCL-NOS from BL classified 53% of DZsig+ tumors as BL-like, and those classified as DLBCL-like were frequently BCL2-rearranged. Among DZsig- GCB tumors, 95% were DLBCL-like. Centralized pathology review reclassified almost half of tumors as DLBCL-NOS but did not identify a more homogenous HGBCL-NOS population, with no difference in features between confirmed and reclassified tumors. In conclusion, molecular testing enables a subset of HGBCL-NOS to be assigned to established categories. Based on rarity and diagnostic challenges, broader inclusion of HGBCL-NOS should be considered in biomarker-driven DLBCL trials.Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), permitting only noncommercial, nonderivative use with attribution.",Blood advances,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Collinge B|Hilton L K|Wong J|Alduaij W|Ben-Neriah S|Slack G W|Farinha P|Boyle M|Meissner B|Cook J R|Ott G|Rosenwald A|Campo E|Amador C|Greiner T C|Raess P W|Song J Y|Inghirami G|Ondrejka S L|Jaffe E S|Weisenburger D D|Chan W C|Holte H|Beiske K|Fu K|Delabie J|Pittaluga S|Iqbal J|Wright G|Savage K J|Mungall A J|Staudt L M|Steidl C|Feldman A L|Morin R D|Rimsza L M|Scott D W,Feldman A L,"Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.|Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.|Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus and Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.|Institute of Pathology, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.|Hematopathology Section, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigaciones Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.|Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.|Department of Pathology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.|Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.|Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital and K.G.

40737539,Real-world outcomes of infections following tisagenlecleucel in patients with B-cell ALL: a CIBMTR analysis.,"Tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) is a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL). We report infectious complications for 100 days (D100) following tisa-cel therapy in 471 pediatric and young adults (median age 13.8 years) with R/R B-ALL reported from September 2017 to June 2022. By D100, 137 (29%) patients had an infectious event, with an infection density of 0.542 per 100 person-days at risk. D100 cumulative incidences of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were 14.1%, 11.6%, and 1.3%, corresponding to infection density scores of 0.296, 0.213, and 0.033 per 100 person-days at risk, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, receipt of ≥3 lines of therapy before tisa-cel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.08; P = .015), any-grade cytokine release syndrome (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.17-2.71; P = .007), and lack of neutrophil recovery (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.47-4.69; P = .001) were associated with an increased risk for any infection. Similar associations were observed for bacterial infections, with the addition of younger age as an adverse risk (<6 vs 6-15 years; HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.23-4.61; P = .01). Risk factors for viral infections included increasing age (1-year increase; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .016), prior history of any infection (HR, 2.76, 95% CI, 1.40-5.46; P = .004), and prior hematopoietic cell transplant (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.18-3.71; P = .011). D100 infection-related mortality (IRM) rate was low at 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.8).

40763269,Treatment and outcomes of progression of disease post-CAR T-cell therapy in mantle cell lymphoma: a multicenter analysis.,"The treatment patterns and clinical outcomes for patients experiencing progression of disease (POD) following CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are undefined. We identified all patients who received CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy for R/R MCL therapy across 15 international centers, and studied those experiencing POD post-CAR T-cell therapy in detail. We extracted clinical/treatment/pathologic variables, and associated these features with survival outcomes. In total, 384 patients received CAR T-cell therapy, and 135 (35%) experienced POD. POD occurred at a median of 6 months following CAR T-cell therapy infusion, and most (64%) patients with POD had complete response as best response to CAR T-cell therapy. Tumor features at POD included blastoid/pleomorphic morphology in 29 of 78 (37%) patients, and TP53 mutation in 21 of 41 (51%) patients. Following POD, 17 patients received no further therapy, 13 underwent local therapy, and 105 received systemic therapy. The most common first-line systemic therapies were chemo(immuno)therapy (22 patients; overall response rate [ORR], 40%), pirtobrutinib (17 patients; ORR, 36%), and bispecific antibodies (13 patients; ORR, 67%). Among patients experiencing POD, the median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 2.5 months and 5.4 months, respectively, from POD. Lack of response to CAR T-cell therapy and short time from CAR T-cell therapy infusion to POD (<3 vs 3-6 vs >6 months), among other factors, were associated with inferior OS after POD. In conclusion, we confirm the challenging prognosis for patients experiencing POD following CD19 CAR T-cell therapy for R/R MCL, and establish a benchmark for future investigations in this patient population.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

FDA-approved first-line systemic therapies include atezolizumab/bevacizumab (atezo/bev) and durvalumab/tremelimumab (durva/treme); however, there is a lack of comparative data.We reviewed outcomes of patients with uHCC who initiated atezo/bev or durva/treme between 2017 and 2024, across six institutions. Overall survival (OS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox models, adjusting for baseline characteristics.Four hundred fifty-two uHCC pts were included.

41052305,Management of Canadian patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the real world: a subanalysis of the RE-MIND2 study.,"In the current Canadian treatment landscape for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL), eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) guides the choice of salvage treatment. CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies have improved outcomes in patients with chemorefractory DLBCL, but access is limited to eligible patients. This subanalysis of the RE-MIND2 observational retrospective cohort study investigated treatment patterns for R/R DLBCL in Canada.Data from patients enrolled in RE-MIND2 treated between 2010 and 2020 at 2 Canadian centers were retrospectively collected from health records. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze baseline characteristics, treatment initiated, and duration of treatment by line of therapy.One hundred and nine patients were included; 74.2% of patients were eligible for ASCT as 2L therapy, and 45.4% received transplants. ASCT eligibility for third- (3L) and fourth-line (4L) therapy declined to 17.1% and 5.9%, respectively. Patients received a wide variety of treatments in 3 and 4L. CAR-T therapy became available in 3 and 4L by the end of 2019. Median durations of treatment were <2.6 months in all lines of therapy; median time to next treatment ranged from 3.4 months in 4L to 5.3 months in 2L.Results of our study support that ASCT-ineligible patients have a poor prognosis with conventional salvage chemotherapy. Before the availability of novel immunotherapies, no apparent standard of care was observed for Canadian patients with R/R DLBCL who were ineligible for or did not receive ASCT, especially after 2L treatment.© The Author(s) 2025.

41056528,Factors Associated With More Medication Trials Before Surgical Evaluation and Postsurgical Outcomes in Pediatric Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.,"Despite strong evidence supporting timely surgical evaluation, many children with drug-resistant epilepsy undergo multiple antiseizure medication (ASM) trials before surgery. Because guidelines recommend evaluation after failure of 2 appropriate ASMs, evaluation after failure of >2 ASMs serves as a clinically relevant benchmark. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with initiation of surgical evaluation after failure of >2 ASMs and evaluate its association with seizure freedom.We performed a retrospective analysis using the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium Surgery Database, including 24 US pediatric epilepsy centers. Children aged 18 years and younger who initiated epilepsy surgery evaluation between January 2018 and February 2023 were included. Timing of evaluation was defined by the number of ASM failures before first phase I evaluation (≤2 vs >2). Unadjusted analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of later evaluation and assess its association with seizure freedom, adjusting for etiology, seizure type, MRI findings, and surgical procedure.Among 1,767 patients, 802 (45.4%) initiated surgical evaluation after failing ≤2 ASMs and 965 (54.6%) after failing >2 ASMs, with a median age at seizure onset of 5.96 and 4.00 years, respectively. Factors independently associated with later initiation of surgical evaluation included genetic etiology (odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.60), generalized seizures (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.58-4.40), daily seizures (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-2.14), multiple seizure types (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.39-1.82), normal MRI (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.52-2.18), and abnormal neurologic examination (OR 2.44, 95% CI 2.01-2.96). Surgical intervention rates were similar (∼50%) between groups. Patients who initiated surgical evaluation after failure of ≤2 ASMs had significantly higher seizure freedom rates (60.8% vs 39.3%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, failure of >2 ASMs before surgical evaluation was independently associated with lower odds of seizure freedom (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96, p = 0.028).Initiation of surgical evaluation after failure of more than 2 ASMs is associated with more complex epilepsy phenotypes and lower rates of seizure freedom. However, 80% of these patients still experienced a >50% reduction in seizures, highlighting the therapeutic benefits of timely epilepsy surgery-even when seizure freedom is unlikely-regardless of epilepsy subtype.",Neurology,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Samanta D|Newell G|Caraway A R|Brock E|Albert G W|Novotny E J|Depositario Cabacar D F|Oluigbo C O|Gaillard W D|Tatachar P|Bolton J B|Wong-Kisiel L|Romanowski E F|Mcnamara N A|Eschbach K|Alexander A L|Auguste K I|Gonzalez-Giraldo E|Bernardo D|Ostendorf A P|Coryell J|Karia S|Karakas C|Javarayee P K|Pichon P D|Olaya J|Shrey D W|Reddy S B|Ganesh A|Hauptman J S|Singh R K|Ciliberto M|Marashly A|Grinspan Z M|Nangia S|Arredondo K|Miller D J|Sattar S|Montenegro M|Agarwal N|Galan F N|Wagner J|Abel T J|Knox A T|Perry M S,Wong-Kisiel L,"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.|University of Colorado, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora.|Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX.|Seattle Children's Hospital, WA.|Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC.|Ann & Robert H.

41066723,Core Clinical Features Associated With Survival in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies.,"This analysis used clinical data from prospectively followed participants meeting criteria for probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) between 1998 and 2024. DLB is characterized by unique core features of visual hallucinations (VHs), parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive fluctuations with a variable disease course. DLB is associated with a poor prognosis, but whether these unique DLB core clinical features influence survival is unknown. We aimed to determine whether core clinical features are associated with survival in patients with probable DLB.Patients followed in the Mayo Clinic ADRC between 1998 and 2024 underwent annual clinical assessments. Those who met clinical criteria for probable DLB were analyzed. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models using age as the time scale determined associations between the individual and cumulative number of core clinical DLB features and survival. The prognostic significance of core features present at the time DLB criteria were met was assessed in separate models. Models were adjusted for sex and duration from the onset of cognitive symptoms to DLB diagnosis.Of 488 patients with probable DLB meeting inclusion criteria, 118 (24%) were women with a mean age of 71.9 ± 8.4 years at the time of meeting probable DLB criteria. Shorter survival was associated with the development of VHs (hazard ratio [HR] 3.25, 95% CI 2.46-4.29) and parkinsonism (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.54-3.39) during the disease course and VHs at the time of DLB diagnosis (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.18-2.16). All four core features were also associated with shorter survival (4 core features vs 2 core features, HR 3.58 95% CI 2.66-4.80, 4 core features vs 3 core features, HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.86-3.25). In 191 patients (45 women (24%) with a mean age of 71.2 ± 8.6 years at probable DLB diagnosis) with autopsy-confirmed DLB, VHs, parkinsonism, and all four core features were associated with shorter survival. Sex was not associated with survival.VHs, parkinsonism, and the development of all 4 core features were associated with shorter survival in probable and in autopsy-confirmed DLB. These findings have important prognostic and management implications for patients with DLB and their caregivers.",Neurology,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,McCarter S J|Ferman T J|Grant K M|Aakre J|Knopman D S|Graff-Radford N R|Forsberg L K|Fields J A|Day G S|Miyagawa T|Savica R|Botha H|Jones D T|Ramanan V K|Lachner C|Nguyen A T|Murray M E|Petersen R C|Reichard R R|Dickson D W|Kantarci K|Boeve B F|Graff-Radford J,McCarter S J|Ferman T J|Grant K M|Aakre J|Knopman D S|Graff-Radford N R|Forsberg L K|Fields J A|Day G S|Miyagawa T|Savica R|Botha H|Jones D T|Ramanan V K|Lachner C|Nguyen A T|Murray M E|Petersen R C|Reichard R R|Dickson D W|Kantarci K|Boeve B F|Graff-Radford J,"Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Center for Sleep Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL; and.|Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","McCarter S J, Ferman T J, Grant K M, Aakre J, Knopman D S, Graff-Radford N R, Forsberg L K, Fields J A, Day G S, Miyagawa T, Savica R, Botha H, Jones D T, Ramanan V K, Lachner C, Graff-Radford J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41066723/,

41183210,The RANK/RANKL axis controls vascular dynamics in the bone marrow.,"Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is an essential cytokine that induces osteoclastic differentiation by monocyte-macrophage lineage precursors. Here, we showed that in addition to its conventional action, RANKL controls vascular permeability in the bone marrow, where it facilitates the mobilization of hematopoietic monocytic cells, including osteoclast precursors, and resultantly regulates bone metabolism. RANK, a cognate receptor for RANKL, is abundantly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and controls vascular permeability by regulating the expression patterns of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. High RANKL expression was detected in perivascular C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12-abundant reticular (CAR) stromal cells. Specific deletion of RANKL expression in CAR cells abrogated the vascular leakage, suggesting that perivascular RANKL is responsible for controlling permeability.

41217693,The effect of Peyton's four-step method for teaching point-of-care ultrasound psychomotor skills: an experimental study.,"Medical education commonly utilizes the ""see one, do one"" two-step approach for teaching psychomotor skills; however, recent evidence suggests that Peyton's four-step method leads to superior learning. There is limited evidence, and almost no high-quality studies, specifically evaluating the effect of Peyton's Four‑Step method on long-term retention of ultrasound/POCUS procedural skills. The purpose of this research project was to evaluate the effectiveness of Peyton's four-step method on teaching the POCUS psychomotor skills of image acquisition to novice learners. Additionally, this research project assessed the influence of Peyton's four-step method at three different points in time during the skill acquisition phase, in the setting of ongoing deliberate skill practice.A single-blinded, repeated measures interventional study based on experimental design was completed. Physician Assistant students from one large academic medical center were randomized into a control group (using the two-step method) and intervention group (using Peyton's four-step method). Students were taught POCUS of the aorta, bladder, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Students' POCUS skills were assessed during the immediate, intermediate, and delayed learning phases. At each assessment, an organ-specific score and a total score were obtained. Scores were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. An ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed using a generalized linear mixed model with a multinomial distribution and cumulative logit link function to assess the overall effect of Peyton's four-step method.Students who were taught using Peyton's method were found to have an increased likelihood of higher total scores compared to those taught using usual instruction (OR = 4.2, p = 0.003). Peyton's method was found to have increased likelihood of higher scores for cardiac (OR = 2.3, p = 0.032), lung (OR = 2.5, p = 0.034), and kidney (OR = 3.0, p = 0.015). Student performance statistically improved with Peyton's four-step method during the immediate (p = 0.031) and delayed (p = 0.011) skill acquisition phases, but not in the intermediate phase.Peyton's four-step method improves overall psychomotor skill acquisition for POCUS. Peyton's four-step method specifically improved psychomotor skills in the immediate skill acquisition phase and the delayed skill acquisition phase. The benefit of Peyton's four-step method was more prominent in POCUS applications with higher complexity.© 2025.

41215658,Quality of life and healthcare resource utilization among adult patients with short bowel syndrome: A mixed-methods study leveraging an integrated database.,"Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a chronic condition requiring parenteral nutrition (PN) support and multidisciplinary management. However, disparities in access to care and standardized treatment pathways, in addition to economic burden, remain considerable for patients. Understanding healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and treatment patterns, especially in relation to patient-reported outcomes (PROs), is critical for improving care.A cross-sectional, multiphase study was conducted in 2023. This analysis focuses on phase 3, using a deidentified database that integrated claims and PROs from 68 patients in phase 2. Twenty-three patients were included in the analytic cohort after applying additional criteria. Descriptive statistics summarized patient demographics, HCRU, and treatment patterns for the overall cohort and stratified by median SBS-quality of life (QoL) score.The median age at SBS diagnosis was 35 years, and 91% of patients were female. Patients saw a median of 35 different healthcare providers and underwent approximately five procedures before diagnosis. In the 6 months after diagnosis, 39% had been hospitalized, and 26% had emergency room (ER) visits. Healthcare costs increased after diagnosis, with long-term PN use accounting for 34% of total costs. Patients with worse QoL had a higher number of ER visits than patients with better QoL. Patients who self-reported being treated by SBS specialists had lower healthcare costs than patients who did not receive specialized care.SBS is associated with high HCRU and costs, particularly for patients with poor QoL. Multidisciplinary care, especially from SBS specialists, may help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.© 2025 Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

41215723,Review Article: The Evolving Role of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Gastroenterology Practice.,"Obesity affects over 40% of the US population and contributes to worse outcomes in a variety of diseases and disorders. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have drawn attention for their impact on obesity. With a dense population of receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract, it is critical to understand the way that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists impact gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.To evaluate the expanding role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity and gastrointestinal disease, with a focus on therapeutic applications, impact on gastrointestinal cancers, safety profile, and implications for gastroenterology practice.New conducted a narrative review of recent clinical trials, cohort studies, and guideline updates through 2025. Evidence was synthesised on efficacy, safety, and clinical implications across gastrointestinal disorders including steatotic liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, and obesity-associated cancers.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists induce substantial and durable weight loss and improve obesity-related gastrointestinal outcomes. They are approved for steatotic liver disease, with demonstrated histologic and biochemical benefits. Evidence suggests a reduced incidence of several gastrointestinal cancers. The most common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and delayed gastric emptying, which may affect peri-endoscopic management. Discontinuation rates remain substantial but can be mitigated by careful titration and specialist oversight.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a critical therapy for obesity and several related gastrointestinal conditions. Gastroenterologists are uniquely positioned to optimize their use, manage adverse events, coordinate multidisciplinary care, and ensure safe and effective integration into practice.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Pomenti S|Gerber A|Katzka D|Camilleri M|Hur C,Camilleri M,"Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Clinical Enteric Neuroscience Translational and Epidemiological Research (C.E.N.T.E.R.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Pomenti S, Gerber A, Katzka D, Camilleri M, Hur C",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41215723/,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a promising treatment for obesity and related gastrointestinal conditions, as they can lead to significant and long-lasting weight loss and improve outcomes in diseases like fatty liver disease and certain cancers.

41217357,Competency-Based Simulation Training for Procedural Skills: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"We conducted a systematic review of competency-based simulation education for medical procedural skills, encompassing a diverse range of healthcare domains and professions. Meta-analysis showed competency-based simulation is more effective than noncompetency-based simulation for skill outcomes (large effect). Outcomes are favorable, but small, for behaviors in practice and patient effects. Specific instructional design features examining different simulators and different types and sources of feedback were common themes identified among studies though no instructional design features were found to have significant impact on skill acquisition. This review also identified significant gaps in research including a lack of standardized terminology and reporting methods as well as a limited number of studies assessing the impact on behaviors in practice and patient effects. This study contributes to the ongoing evidence to support competency-based simulation training and highlights the need for further research to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of training of healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41217438,An Overview of Allowable Total Error in the Clinical Laboratory.,"Allowable total error (ATE) is a quality concept that defines acceptable analytical performance for a clinical laboratory assay. ATE will vary in terms of the amount of error permissible not only between assays but also based on the test setting and the assay's clinical use. In the clinical laboratory, ATE limits are routinely applied, for example, when evaluating new analytical methodology or equipment for patient testing, troubleshooting unacceptable quality control, or in evaluating instrument comparability.Currently, there are no universally applicable standards for defining the maximum magnitude of allowable error. However, there are several resources available for users to consider when setting ATE limits. Examples include clinical outcomes studies, biological variation of the measurand, state-of-the-art, professional organizations, and requirements set by regulatory agencies and proficiency testing/external quality assessment scheme organizers. Each of these approaches varies in terms of the resulting magnitude of allowable error for the same assay. This review describes these resources in more detail and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.ATE users should be aware of different resources and their limitations before defining acceptance criteria for an assay in their clinical laboratory.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.

41217518,Development of anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis outcome rating score using the Rasch analysis.,"Anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis is an immunotherapy-responsive condition with growing interest in clinical trial development. However, the lack of reliable outcome measures is a major barrier. We aim to design a disease-specific outcome measure for anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis.The anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis outcome rating (LOR) score was proposed through expert consensus and literature review. It was applied to a development cohort of 81 patients, followed by Rasch analysis to evaluate item-person targeting, reliability, and dimensionality. Adjustments were made to improve its psychometric performance. The finalized score was re-applied to the development cohort and validated in a separate cohort of 54 patients. Finally, the score was assessed in a longitudinal cohort of 53 patients for responsiveness.The LOR score consists of 6 items: seizure type, seizure frequency, memory, orientation, behavioral disturbance, and gait, with a total score of 19. Compared to the CASE score, the LOR score can better capture patients across varying levels of severity, without major floor or ceiling effects. The scoring within each item proportionally reflected the item's difficulty. The score was relatively unidimensional. The reliability (0.63) and separation (1.34) indicated very small random errors. The inter-rater and intra-rater reliability (κ > 0.85) was excellent. In the longitudinal cohort, the changes in LOR score are significantly different among different clinical impression of change (IOC) categories (p < 0.01), indicating its ability to detect clinically meaningful changes.The LOR score is a psychometrically reliable, sensitive, responsive, and relatively unidimensional outcome measure, which may be used in clinical practice and trial settings.© 2025.

40435511,Infection after CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma: real-world analysis from CIBMTR.,"Infection is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) receiving CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The current study analyzed the natural history, risk factors, and outcomes of infection in 3350 patients with R/R LBCL receiving commercial CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (n = 2804 axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi-cel], n = 546 tisagenlecleucel) from December 2017 to June 2022. Infection developed in 834 patients (24.9%) within 100 days after infusion, resulting in an infection density of 0.43 per 100 patient days and a 100-day cumulative incidence of 22%. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were recorded in 527 (15.7%), 374 (11.2%), and 108 patients (3.2%), respectively, with corresponding infection densities of 0.23, 0.15, and 0.04 per 100 patient days. After a 24-month median follow-up, 1482 patients (44%) had died, with infection as the primary cause in 173 cases (12%). The 100-day infection-related mortality (IRM) was 1.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.0). Patients with a Karnofsky performance score of ≤80, infection history before CAR T-cell therapy, axi-cel therapy, severe cytokine release syndrome (grade ≥3), and severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (grade ≥3) had increased infection risk. Infections within 100 days were an independent risk factor for inferior overall survival beyond day 100 after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. In conclusion, study results show a significant incidence of infection and IRM in patients with R/R LBCL treated with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Furthermore, results identify patients at a heightened risk of infection, offering insights to guide potential interventions aimed at mitigating infection and improving patient outcomes after CAR T-cell therapy.Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), permitting only noncommercial, nonderivative use with attribution.",Blood advances,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Wudhikarn K|Herr M M|Chen M|Martens M J|Baird J H|Gowda L|Rangarajan H G|Abid M B|Kharfan-Dabaja M A|Williams K M|Ganguly S|Young J H|Sharma A|Fatobene G|Jain T|Kanakry C G|Modi D|Grover N S|Salem B|Batista M V|Vergidis P|Yin D E|Beitinjaneh A M|Kelkar A H|Nishihori T|Holter Chakrabarty J|Gergis U|Smith M|El Boghdadly Z|Dandoy C E|Murthy H S|Huppler A R|Perales M|Chemaly R F|Hill J A|Riches M|Auletta J J,Kharfan-Dabaja M A|Vergidis P|Murthy H S,"Center of Excellence in Translational Hematology and Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.|CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Biostatistics, Data Science Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Lymphoma, Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.|Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale Cancer Center and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH.|Divisions of Hematology/Oncology and Infectious Diseases, Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Hematology-Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.|Houston Methodist Hospital and Neal Cancer Center, Houston, TX.|Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.|Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.|LIM31, Disciplina de Hematologia, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.|Division of Hematological Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Center for Immuno-Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.|Division of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI.|Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.|Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.|Department of Infectious Disease, A.C.
