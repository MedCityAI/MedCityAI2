40634180,Meeting Report From the 2024 Symposium on IRAK4 in Cancer: Highlights and Clinical Updates.,"Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. IRAK4 drives the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which promotes cell survival, inflammation, and proliferation. Aberrant activation of IRAK4 and TLR signaling has been implicated in multiple malignancies. At the 3rd Annual IRAK4 in Cancer Symposium, experts discussed the role of IRAK4 in cancer biology, the potential for synergism between IRAK4 inhibition and other treatments to overcome resistance, and how IRAK4 inhibition may improve clinical outcomes. Preclinical data were presented demonstrating the activity of IRAK4 inhibition alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, melanoma brain metastases, gastrointestinal cancers, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Clinical data from the targeted small-molecule IRAK4 inhibitor emavusertib (CA-4948) were presented, including data from the TakeAim Leukemia and TakeAim Lymphoma trials of emavusertib in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, respectively, and preliminary data from trials of emavusertib in multiple solid tumors. The meeting closed with expert discussion of the emerging profile of IRAK4 inhibition in cancers and the potential for IRAK4 inhibition to improve outcomes across both solid and liquid tumors.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40631425,The Effects of Childhood Abuse on Emerging Adulthood Inflammation: Investigating Protective Characteristics.,"Biological embedding of stress is a process commonly observed among individuals with histories of early life adversity. Adverse experiences can get ""under the skin"" and influence the neural and biological characteristics of an individual, impacting a range of health domains including inflammation. This study aimed to identify characteristics that protect individuals against immune health challenges following childhood abuse (e.g., physical, emotional, sexual). Childhood self-regulation and peer likeability were tested as moderators in the effects of abuse on emerging adulthood inflammation. Participants (N = 421) were drawn from a follow-up study of emerging adults with and without maltreatment histories who participated in a research camp program as children. Maltreatment was determined based on CPS record data, self-regulation was informed by camp counselor report, peer likeability was indicated through camp participants' ratings, and adulthood inflammation was identified via salivary C-reactive protein (CRP). Results indicated that childhood abuse did not have a significant main effect on emerging adulthood inflammation. However, among youth who were more behaviorally disinhibited, the experience of abuse was predictive of lower inflammation. Peer likeability did not significantly moderate the association between abuse and inflammation. Results underscore how multifinality in health outcomes following abuse, including resilience, may be shaped by individual characteristics.",Child maltreatment,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Ross A J|Russotti J|Cicchetti D|Handley E D,Ross A J|Russotti J|Handley E D,"Mt.

40611804,Interobserver reproducibility of hilar soft tissue invasion in testicular germ cell tumours among genitourinary pathologists.,"Compared to lymphovascular invasion (LVI), hilar soft tissue invasion (HSTI) is a relatively novel pT2 staging parameter in testicular germ cell tumours (GCT), associated with metastasis at the time of diagnosis and a risk factor for disease relapse. Given diagnostic variability in how pathologists interpret HSTI, herein we explore interobserver reproducibility among genitourinary (GU) pathologists.Twenty haematoxylin and eosin-stained digitized slides from testicular GCTs were distributed to 30 GU pathologists to classify each as HSTI or not HSTI based on their respective clinical practices; slides with concomitant LVI were excluded. Slides were then evaluated for the following morphologic features: tumour invasion beyond prominent hilar vessels, tumour invasion beyond the rete, tumour invasion beyond the level parallel to hilar adipose tissue and tumour within (directly touching) hilar adipose tissue. Interobserver reproducibility was assessed, and the morphological features were correlated with HSTI. Relationships between pathologists' interpretations, morphological features and HSTI were evaluated using hierarchical clustering.Although the diagnosis of HSTI was relatively uniform with a majority agreement (>67%) reached in 17/20 slides, overall interobserver reproducibility was only moderate (kappa = 0.50). Morphological features such as invasion beyond the level parallel to hilar adipose tissue and invasion into fat were more sensitive and specific for HSTI, while features such as invasion beyond hilar vessels and invasion beyond rete were less useful.These findings suggest that more specific defined diagnostic criteria for testicular GCT HSTI are needed.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Histopathology,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Wu D J|Akgul M|Williamson S R|Pacheco R|Acosta A|Al-Obaidy K|Amin M|Berney D|Brimo F|Cheng L|Colecchia M|Compérat E|Cornejo K|Dhillon J|Downes M|Epstein J I|Hirsch M S|Jimenez R|Kaushal S|Lobo A|Lopez-Beltran A|Mehra R|Mohanty S K|Paner G|Rao P|Reuter V|Shah R B|Shen S|Smith S|Tretiakova M|Trpkov K|Wobker S E|Tamboli P|Zynger D|Sangoi A R,Jimenez R,"Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, California, USA.|Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.|Albany Medical Center, Albany, New York, USA.|Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.|McLaren Pathology Group, McLaren Healthcare, Flint, Michigan, USA.|University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA.|Queen Mary University, London, UK.|McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.|Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.|Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.|Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|H.

40607767,Multi-Institutional Survey of 4-Year Ultrasound Quality Control Findings.,"Periodic quality control (QC) testing of ultrasound (US) imaging systems is essential to ensure and maintain image quality and safety. The study aims to analyze QC findings from medical physics annual surveys of modern clinical US systems in a multi-institutional survey.QC results from annual surveys between 2018 and 2021 were retrospectively collected from 12 medical physicists from 11 institutions or consulting companies (hereafter referred to as sites). QC tests were classified as scanner- and transducer-related tests, where scanner-related tests also included evaluation of diagnostic workstation display monitors and routine QC programs if applicable. Test methodology and pass/fail criteria were established by each site. QC findings were defined as results requiring follow-up action by service engineers, vendors, or other personnel. The percentage of annual findings was calculated for each site and averaged across the years of data contributed. Furthermore, findings across all sites were aggregated for an overall analysis.QC data from a total of 1069 scanner tests and 4542 transducer tests were collected. The average annual percentage of scanner-related findings varied from 0 to 40.8% among all sites (first quartile 8.7%, median 18.2%, and third quartile 34.1%), while that of transducer-related findings ranged between 0.5% and 19.9% (first quartile 3.9%, median 7.2%, and third quartile 14.5%). For scanner-related tests, the top 3 categories of findings were associated with physical and mechanical integrity (171 findings, 74.7%), quantitative testing of the scanner display monitor (40 findings, 17.5%), and scanner port creating artifacts (10 findings, 4.4%). The top 3 findings for transducers related to uniformity and artifact (227 findings, 79.9%), physical and mechanical integrity (44 findings, 15.5%), and sensitivity in fundamental mode (9 findings, 3.2%).Medical physics annual surveys revealed considerable actionable findings of modern US systems, which inform the status of current US QC practices in the United States and may guide future standardization and recommendation of QC tests.© 2025 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.",J Ultrasound Med,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Long Z|Russ M|Larson S|Holland M R|Lu Z|Kofler C|Zhou W|Chen J|Li Z|Zagzebski J|Stickel J|Dohatcu A,Long Z,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Clinical Imaging Physics Group, Department of Radiology, Duke University Health System, Durham, NC, USA.|Department of Radiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.|Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.|Department of Radiology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.|Department of Radiology, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.|Department of Radiology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA.|Department of Radiology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.|Department of Medical Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.|Diagnostic and Nuclear Medicine section, Colorado Associates in Medical Physics, Colorado Springs, CO, USA.|Radiation Safety, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.","Long Z, Russ M, Larson S, Holland M R, Lu Z, Kofler C, Zhou W, Chen J, Li Z, Zagzebski J, Stickel J, Dohatcu A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40607767/,"This study analyzed quality control (QC) findings from annual surveys of modern ultrasound (US) systems in multiple healthcare institutions.

40582417,Effects of Age at Surgery and Laterality of Cataract on Visual Acuity 5 Years after Surgery in Infants Left Aphakic.,"To evaluate 5-year visual acuity (VA) outcomes by age at surgery and laterality among infants left aphakic at initial lensectomy.Prospective Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group cataract registry.A total of 149 infants (203 eyes; 123 with bilateral surgery) underwent surgery before 12 months of age (median, 1.8; range, 0.6-11.6 months) for nontraumatic cataract without preexisting glaucoma or anterior/posterior segment anomalies who were left aphakic.Records were reviewed annually for 5 years after surgery. Children were grouped by age at first surgery (<2 months, 2 to <6 months, and 6 to <12 months). Analyses accounted for nonindependence of eye pairs.Mean VA and proportion of eyes with VA better than 20/200.Eighty-nine (60%) infants were female, 114 infants (77%) were White, 17 infants (11%) were Black, and 21 infants (14%) were Hispanic or Latino. In unilateral cases (N = 80), surgery before 2 months of age was associated with better mean VA at 5 years than with surgery between 2 and <6 months of age (0.79 vs 1.13 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR], difference = 0.34 [95% CI, 0.08-0.59], P = 0.01). In bilateral cases (N = 123), age at surgery was not associated with 5-year VA outcomes (P = 0.18). A larger proportion of bilaterally operated eyes had VA better than 20/200 compared with undergoing unilateral surgery before 2 months (87% vs 61%; difference = 26% [95% CI, 8%-43%]; P = 0.004) and 2 to <6 months of age (95% vs 23%; difference = 72% [95% CI, 55%-90%]; P < 0.001).For bilateral surgery in the first year of life, 5-year VA did not differ by age at surgery. However, for unilateral cataract, 5-year VA was better with surgery before 2 months of age compared with 2 to <6 months. These observations may inform surgical decision-making when treating a cataract in the first 2 months of life. Given the increased risk for glaucoma with early cataract surgery, the surgeon may choose a modest delay in the timing of surgery, accepting a decrease in the VA outcome for unilateral cases.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.Copyright © 2025 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

40578685,Cellular senescence and its association with aldose reductase promote cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common, life threatening inherited kidney diseases. In the kidney, senescence is accumulated in different renal cells, which are in a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in response to stresses. However, the role of cellular senescence in ADPKD remains elusive.Here, using different senescence markers, senolytic drugs, and transgenic INK-ATTAC mice, we define the role of senescence in ADPKD. Additionally, we identify SASP senescence-associated secretory phenotype by using our single-cell RNA sequencing database to monitor differential gene expressions in mutant and control mouse kidneys.Senescence is increased in Pkd1 mutant mice and human ADPKD kidneys. Treatment with D-galactose, an inducer of senescence, promotes cyst progression, whereas treatment with senolytic drugs, including dasatinib (D), quercetin (Q), and D plus Q, delays disease progression in Pkd1 mutant kidneys. Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delayed cyst growth in Pkd1RC/RC:INK-ATTAC mice, supporting a direct role of those cells in promoting cystogenesis in ADPKD. The secretion of SASP from senescent Pkd1 mutant cells induces senescence in neighboring cells and increases kidney epithelial cell proliferation and the activation of fibroblasts. We identify AKR1B1 (aldose reductase) as one of the Pkd1 gene mutation-associated SASP factors. Targeting AKR1B1 with its non-competitive and reversible inhibitor epalrestat delayed cyst growth in Pkd1 mutant mouse kidneys.Our study supports the idea that senescence-targeting interventions including senolytics, removal of p16-positive senescent cells, and inhibition of AKR1B1 are promising therapeutic strategies to delay cyst growth in ADPKD.Published by Elsevier Inc.",Kidney international,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Mao X|Li L|Lee G|Agborbesong E|Zhou J X|Calvet J P|Li X,Mao X|Li L|Lee G|Agborbesong E|Zhou J X|Li X,"Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

40572029,Secondary Peristalsis Is More Affected Than Primary Peristalsis by Increased Intragastric Pressure After Metabolic Bariatric Surgery: Findings From Functional Lumen Imaging Probe and High-Resolution Esophageal Manometry.,"Esophageal dysmotility following metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) may relate to decreased gastric compliance. We investigated high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) and secondary peristalsis assessed by functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) and their association with intragastric pressure after MBS.Patients undergoing HRM, FLIP, and barium esophagram (BE) after MBS were included. HRM metrics and proximal intragastric pressure at baseline (IGP baseline), during wet swallow-induced esophagogastric junction relaxation (IGP EGJ opening), and following wet swallow-induced esophagogastric junction opening with subsequent closure (IGP post EGJ closure) were measured. Contractile response was assessed during FLIP.Forty patients (26 Roux en Y gastric bypass, 14 sleeve gastrectomy) with FLIP a median of 4 years after MBS, were identified. HRM was normal or consistent with ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) in 33 (82.5%) patients, while the contractile response on FLIP was abnormal (disordered/impaired, absent, or spastic reactive) in 28 (70%). Delayed emptying on BE was numerically more frequent with abnormal FLIP (6% vs. 0%, p = 0.08). IGP post-EGJ closure (median 21.8 vs. 15 mmHg, p = 0.03) and ∆ IGP post-EGJ closure-IGP baseline (median 4 vs. 0 mmHg, p = 0.02) were greater and predictive of abnormal contractility on FLIP (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.2, p = 0.03 and OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.07-2.39, p = 0.003, respectively).Abnormal contractility on FLIP, reflecting disordered secondary peristalsis, frequently occurs despite normal HRM findings after MBS. Secondary peristalsis may be associated with reduced gastric compliance, reflected by elevated proximal intragastric pressure. FLIP contractility could serve as an early marker for post-MBS esophageal dysfunction.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Ravi K|Perananthan V|Hanscom M|Razzak F A|Mrad R|Abboud D M|Al Annan K|Kerbage A|Kassmeyer B|Storm A|Vargas Valls E J|Ghanem O M|Abu Dayyeh B K,Ravi K|Perananthan V|Hanscom M|Razzak F A|Mrad R|Abboud D M|Al Annan K|Kerbage A|Kassmeyer B|Storm A|Vargas Valls E J|Ghanem O M|Abu Dayyeh B K,"Division of Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Metabolic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.","Ravi K, Perananthan V, Hanscom M, Razzak F A, Mrad R, Abboud D M, Al Annan K, Kerbage A, Kassmeyer B, Storm A, Vargas Valls E J, Ghanem O M, Abu Dayyeh B K",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40572029/,"The key finding of this study is that secondary peristalsis, which is the esophageal contraction in response to increased pressure in the stomach, is more affected than primary peristalsis (the normal swallowing reflex) in patients who have undergone metabolic bariatric surgery.

Nevertheless, its expression and role in airway smooth muscle (ASM), an airway structural cell indispensable in asthma pathophysiology, are obscure. This study uncovers AhR expression, underlying mechanisms, and activity in ASM during inflammation and asthma.Cultured primary human nonasthmatic and asthmatic ASM cells were treated with TNFα/IL-13, with/without pharmacological inhibitors targeting PI3K, p38MAPK, JNK, NFkB, and AP1. AhR expression was analysed using RNA-sequencing, confocal microscopy, qPCR, and immunoblotting. AP1 specific role was confirmed using c-JUN (AP1) siRNA and ChIP-qPCR. AhR activity was determined by Nano luciferase in AhR agonist-treated cells.We found ubiquitous expression of AhR in ASM with up-regulation in asthmatic ASM. TNFα increased AhR expression, whereas IL-13 did not. Furthermore, p38 and JNK inhibition significantly reduced AhR expression with TNFα exposure, whereas PI3K inhibition had no effect. AP1 inhibition and c-JUN knockdown significantly down-regulated AhR expression, whereas NFkB inhibition showed no effect. TNFα promoted c-JUN binding to AhR promoter and increased AhR mRNA expression. Additionally, AhR agonists significantly increased the xenobiotic response element (XRE) activity, CYP1B1, and AhR nuclear expression. TNFα exposure reduced XRE activity and AhR nuclear expression.Our findings suggest inflammation and asthma transcriptionally up-regulates AhR through the p38/JNK-AP1 pathway in ASM, identifying a potential therapeutic target for modulating AhR and its downstream effects in asthma.© 2025 British Pharmacological Society.",British journal of pharmacology,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Reza M I|Balraj P|Thompson M A|Prakash Y S|Pabelick C M|Britt R D|Sathish V,Thompson M A|Prakash Y S|Pabelick C M,"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, USA.|Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Center for Perinatal Research, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.","Reza M I, Balraj P, Thompson M A, Prakash Y S, Pabelick C M, Britt R D, Sathish V",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40562410/,"This study found that inflammation and asthma increase the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in airway smooth muscle cells through the p38/JNK-AP1 signaling pathway.

40553634,Over 50 years of research on social disparities in pain and pain treatment: a scoping review of reviews.,"Research on social disparities in pain and pain treatment has grown substantially in recent decades, as reflected in a growing number of review articles on these topics. This scoping review of reviews provides a macrolevel overview of scholarship in this area by examining what specific topics and findings have been presented in published reviews. We searched CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science for English-language, peer-reviewed review articles, qualitative or quantitative, that aimed to characterize or explain pain-related differences or inequities across social groups. Of 4432 unique records screened, 397 articles, published over a 56-year period, were included. For each, we documented (1) axes of social difference studied (eg, sex/gender, race/ethnicity), (2) pain-related outcomes (eg, chronic pain prevalence), (3) broad findings, (4) types of mechanisms proposed, and (5) policy or practice recommendations. Findings reveal a sharp increase in the number of published review articles on pain-related disparities since approximately the year 2000. The most commonly studied social dimension was sex/gender, followed by race/ethnicity and age. Studies examining disparities by socioeconomic status, geography, or other categories were rarer. While most findings showed disadvantaged social groups to have worse pain outcomes, there were intriguing exceptions. Biological, psychological, and sociocultural mechanisms were considered much more frequently than sociostructural (macrolevel) ones. Policy/practice recommendations were typically individual-level behavioral suggestions for providers or patients. We identify high-priority areas for future research, including greater attention to lower-income countries, chronic pain prevention, and macrolevel drivers of pain disparities.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40550108,Call to action-Pediatric MASLD requires immediate attention to curb health crisis.,"Pediatric metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become more prevalent on a global scale over the last decades and is associated with significant comorbidities in childhood and a 40-fold higher risk of early mortality in young adulthood. MASLD has now become the leading indication for liver transplantation in young adults in the United States. However, pediatric MASLD is still perceived as an indolent condition by many patients, families, and clinicians. In this Call to Action, we aim to raise awareness of pediatric MASLD as a public health crisis. Herein, we describe insufficient screening and disease staging practices, and a lack of accurate non-invasive tests and effective pharmacotherapy, both stemming from a paucity of multicenter clinical trials in pediatric MASLD. We provide clear steps to address this public health emergency by promoting awareness campaigns, educating and empowering patients and families, addressing barriers including access to care, nutritional and exercise support programs, establishing multidisciplinary care, launching community initiatives, and conducting clinical trials in pediatric MASLD for an age-based evaluation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic options. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive public health policies to control the tide of pediatric MASLD and call upon stakeholders to act now.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Nov 01, 2025",2025,Nov,01,Hartmann P|Mouzaki M|Hassan S|Kehar M|Mysore K R|Mauney E|Nonga D|Karjoo S|Sood S|Tou A|Brichta C|Herdes R E|Pai N|Garner D K|Rinella M E|Noureddin M|Younossi Z|Allen A M|Sanyal A|Kohut T|Kohli R|Ramirez C M|Xanthakos S|Vos M B|Schwimmer J B|Ibrahim S H|Panganiban J,Allen A M|Ibrahim S H,"Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.|Department of Gastroenterology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.|University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada.|Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.|Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Boston Children's Health Physicians, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.|Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.|Ann & Robert H.

40543172,A simple and specific colorimetric biosensor for early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infections.,"Wound healing is a critical aspect of surgical care, often complicated by infections such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). In this study, we aim to develop a sensitive and specific colorimetric biosensor which allows early detection and naked-eye monitoring of PA wound infections. We used hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as a PA specific biomarker and aquacyanocobinamide (ACCbi), a vitamin B12 derivative, as the indicator which changes color from orange to violet upon interaction with HCN. We then encapsulated ACCbi with different electrospun fibers, including polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polyurethane (PU), and evaluated them for suitability as ACCbi carriers. The morphology of the fabricated membranes was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The performance of the materials was assessed for their structural integrity, sensitivity and sensor function. PVAc based membranes demonstrated the best stability and sensitivity, maintaining structural integrity and showing a distinct color change in response to HCN. In a real-world setup of negative pressure wound therapy, the optimized PVAc membranes exhibited a clear color change within 10 h of exposure to PA biofilms formed in vitro and within 12 h to that on ex vivo human skin wounds. The biosensor retained its functionality after two years of storage, offering a promising tool for the early PA detection in clinical wound care.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40534286,Detection of transient tissue displacement using wavelet MR elastography: Phantom validation and in vivo human brain repeatability study.,"While standard MR elastography (MRE) uses harmonic mechanical waves, there are some applications in which imaging and analysis of transient mechanical motion are of interest. Wavelet MRE has been developed for detecting broadband motion from transient excitation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of wavelet MRE for transient displacement detection in brain MRE applications.Transient motion was induced in a gel phantom, while MRE images were acquired using bipolar motion-encoding gradient (MEG) at multiple frequencies (20-200 Hz). Displacements were estimated using (1) combinations of multiple MEGs forming the wavelet MRE and (2) deconvolution from a single MEG. These estimated displacements were used to calculate the MRE phase for each MEG. Correlation (r2) between the calculated and acquired phases was evaluated. Three healthy volunteers were scanned twice in a clinical scanner using wavelet MRE with an occipital impact. Time-resolved brain translation, rotation, and maximal principal strain were calculated. Repeatability was assessed both qualitatively and through Pearson correlation.Wavelet MRE outperformed standard MRE in displacement estimation, showing higher correlations between calculated and acquired phase, even with fewer phase offsets. In the volunteer study, consistent temporal motion dynamics and spatial maximal principal strain distributions across repeated scans demonstrated the repeatability of wavelet MRE.This study validated the accuracy and efficiency of wavelet MRE for broadband motion detection and demonstrated its feasibility and repeatability in vivo.

40530531,Three-dimensional biomechanical analysis of flexible intramedullary nailing constructs in length-unstable pediatric femur fractures.,"Flexible intramedullary nail fixation of pediatric femoral shaft fractures offers advantages such as shorter hospital stays, faster return to function, and less associated costs when compared with traction and casting. This study compared the biomechanical performance of three configurations: 2CS, 2CL, and 3CL. Thirty synthetic femur models with identical, length-unstable, spiral fractures were tested using a three-dimensional camera system to assess real-time micromotion. Three groups were analyzed: (a) 2CS - two 3.5 mm C- and S-shaped nails inserted anterograde, (b) 2CL - one 'C' and one 'S' shaped 3.5 mm titanium nail-inserted retrograde from a single lateral entry, (c) 3CL - two 'C' shaped 3.5 mm titanium nails inserted medially and laterally with a third 'C' shaped 2.5 mm nail placed retrograde from an anterolateral site. Torsional loading, cyclical loading, and load-to-failure tests were conducted. The 3CL configuration demonstrated superior biomechanical performance. It exhibited the highest torsional stiffness [0.67 ± 0.06 Nm/° for external rotation (ER), 0.404 = ± 0.06 Nm/° for internal rotation (IR); P  = 0.002], least displacement (0.05  ± 0.02 vs. 0.30 ± 0.02 mm for 2CL and 0.57 ± 0.05 mm for 2CS; P  = 0.012), and required the highest load-to-failure (162 ± 83 vs. 106 4  ± 75 N for 2CL and 790 ± 34 N for 2CS; P  = 0.016).The 3CL configuration provided superior strength and stability across all tests, supporting its role in the fixation of length-unstable pediatric femoral fractures.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They were historically classified into Leydig cell tumour, Sertoli cell tumour, granulosa cell tumour, and unclassified sex cord-stromal tumour. More recently, classification was expanded to incorporate additional histologic types, including some associated with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. However, the classification of TSCSTs still relies entirely on morphology, with some tumour types being defined based on their resemblance to ovarian counterparts. In recent years, molecular studies have identified drivers and genomic alterations associated with aggressive behaviour and progression; however, these findings have not yet impacted classification and management.Under sponsorship of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS), a group of genitourinary pathologists was assembled in 2023 with the aim of assessing how to use these new data to improve the classification and management of TSCSTs.This paper summarizes the recommendations derived from the consensus activities and the first meeting of the testicular sex cord-stromal tumour (TESST) group (held at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, USA, 3/23/2024).© 2025 The Author(s).

40524563,Development and Validation of a Bowel Diary for Fecal Incontinence: Comparison With a Questionnaire.,"Bowel diaries are used to characterize the severity of fecal incontinence (FI) but have not been adequately validated for this purpose. Our aims were to validate a new bowel diary and to compare the characteristics of FI as assessed with a bowel diary and a validated questionnaire.In this four-center prospective study, patients with a history of FI and asymptomatic controls completed a 28-day bowel diary and validated questionnaires to evaluate bowel habits and FI, quality of life related to FI (FIQoL), and PROMIS scales for anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy.Among 59 participants with FI and 29 asymptomatic controls, the bowel diary was 97% sensitive and 93% specific for distinguishing between FI participants and controls. Over 28 days, FI participants experienced an average [SD] of 31.1 [50.7] FI episodes, consisting of staining (12.6 [14.9]), some stool (12.5 [20.3]), or a full bowel movement (4.4 [8.5]). Correlations between the questionnaire and diary were statistically significant for frequency (Spearman ρ = 0.5, p < 0.001), amount (ρ = 0.4, p < 0.001), and awareness of FI (ρ = 0.3, p = 0.04).

40522310,The Association Between Physician Demographics on Patient Satisfaction Survey Results in Pediatrics: A Role for Implicit Bias?,"We assessed associations of pediatrician demographic characteristics with patient satisfaction (PS) scores. We performed a retrospective analysis of PS scores among pediatricians at a single academic institution and their associations with individual demographic features including gender, race, and geographic location of medical school education. We analyzed PS survey results for 153 pediatricians, 48.4% of whom were female. Males received higher scores in 4 out of 10 questions including ""Likelihood of your recommending this care provider to others"" (P = .007). We observed similar findings for white pediatricians compared to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) (P = .033) and US medical school graduates compared to international school graduates (P = .044).

40653124,Prognostic significance of intraoperative graft flow on long-term patency of below knee popliteal and tibial bypasses with autologous vein in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,"Intraoperative graft flow (GF) is a quick, composite measure of bypass graft status, encompassing adequacy of conduit, technique as well as inflow/outflow. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of GF on long-term patency of below-knee (BKPB) popliteal and tibial (TB) bypasses performed with autogenous vein conduit in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).Data from consecutive patients who underwent BKPB or TB for CLTI using autologous vein between July 2003 and July 2023 and had intraoperative GF measurement (Optima Flow-QC transit-time ultrasound) were retrospectively reviewed. Primary endpoints were primary patency (PP), primary assisted patency (PAP), secondary patency (SP), and major limb amputation. Youden index was used to determine cutoff of GF.There were 177 bypasses in 163 patients (68.9% males; median age, 71 years), 68.4% with Rutherford IV ischemia and 31.6% with Rutherford V/VI ischemia. Comorbidities included hypertension (84.2%), diabetes mellitus (49.2%), coronary artery disease (59.3%), and end-stage renal disease (6.8%), and 26% were active smokers. Outflow targets included BKP or TP trunk in 36.2% and tibial in 63.8%. Venous conduits used were single-segment great saphenous vein (57.6%), arm vein (3.4%), and composite vein (39.0%). Median GF was 132 mL/min (BKPB vs TB; 150 vs 120 mL/min; P = .054). Median clinical follow-up was 47 months (interquartile range, 18-98 months). PP, freedom from major amputation, and overall survival at 1 year following BKPB and TB were 57.6%, 100%, and 86.9% and 40.3%, 86.8%, and 88.2%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, Rutherford VI (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2), GF <110 mL/min (HR, 1.7), and composite vein conduit (HR, 1.7) were associated with loss of patency. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, in grafts with GF >110 mL/min, PP, PAP and SP at 1 year (54%, 77%, and 85%) and 5 years (37%, 68%, and 70%) were significantly higher than those with GF <110 mL/min (1 year: 31%, 48%, and 66%; 5 years: 16%, 34%, and 50%; P < .01).In addition to nonmodifiable factors such as outflow target and composite vein conduit, intraoperative GF flow is an independent predictor of loss of patency of distal bypass grafts with vein conduit in patients with CTLI.

40675368,Grit and resilience among pulmonary and critical care physicians: A multi-institutional study.,"Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) physicians work in stressful environments and are at risk for burnout. Grit and resilience have been shown to protect against burnout in various medical specialties, but this relationship has not been explored among PCCM physicians. The purpose of this study was to determine associations between grit and resilience with burnout, academic productivity, and COVID-19-related clinical experiences in PCCM fellows and faculty.A cross-sectional, multi-institutional survey was conducted during the 2022-2023 academic year among PCCM fellows and faculty from six academic institutions. Measures included the Short Grit Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, single-item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, ICU-level COVID-19 experience, and academic productivity metrics. Mixed-effects proportional odds regression models assessed relationships between grit, resilience, burnout, and academic performance, considering clustering within institutions.One hundred and thirty-one participants were surveyed with a response rate of 40.3 %. Median scores for grit, burnout, and resiliency were 3.8 (0-5), 4 (0-12), and 31 (0-40), respectively. Higher grit correlated with less burnout (OR=0.34, p < 0.001), fewer PubMed publications (OR = 0.57, p = 0.048), and more national or international presentations (OR = 1.99, p = 0.027). Higher resilience was associated with less burnout (OR = 0.90, p = 0.001).This is the first study to examine grit and resilience in the field of PCCM. Higher grit and resilience were associated with less burnout in PCCM physicians. Additionally, physicians with higher grit and resilience scores experienced more COVID-19 related deaths. Given the intense and emotionally taxing nature of PCCM, further research on interventions to optimize grit and resilience in PCCM physicians is needed.Copyright © 2025.

This study evaluates FNA's accuracy in diagnosing Warthin's tumor (WT) and its safety in guiding observational management.Retrospective cohort study.Single institution, Tertiary referral center.Data from 2010 to 2022 including demographics, cytology, pathology, and surgical outcomes were extracted. Accuracy was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).Among 808 patients with parotid tumors, 234 were WTs. Seventy-eight patients underwent surgery with pathology while 156 underwent observation. FNA sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for WTs were 98.2%, 98.1%, 91.8%, and 99.6% respectively. No observational patients developed clinical signs of malignancy, and the median change in tumor size was 0 cm (range -3.1 to 2.1).FNA is highly specific for WT but limited by nondiagnostic results. Observation is a safe approach with minimal risk of growth, malignancy, or infection.","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology","Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Baratz H Q|Ali H M|Staricha K L|Yin L X|Tasche K K|Van Abel K M|Moore E J|Price D L,Baratz H Q|Ali H M|Staricha K L|Yin L X|Tasche K K|Van Abel K M|Moore E J|Price D L,"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.","Baratz H Q, Ali H M, Staricha K L, Yin L X, Tasche K K, Van Abel K M, Moore E J, Price D L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40509670/,"Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a highly accurate test for diagnosing Warthin's tumor, a type of parotid gland tumor.

40780235,Recompensation in decompensated cirrhosis.,"Recompensation of decompensated cirrhosis has been defined by the Baveno consensus as control or cure of the main underlying cause; resolution of clinical manifestations, including ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, without the use of prophylactic medications, and without variceal bleeding for 12 months; and restoration of hepatic function. Cure and recompensation are usually associated with regression of liver fibrosis. Recompensation can occur when hepatitis C virus is eradicated, if hepatitis B virus infection (without hepatitis D co-infection) is suppressed, and following persistent alcohol abstinence in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Although cirrhosis related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease can improve following lifestyle or pharmacotherapy-assisted weight loss, and autoimmune liver disease can respond to immunosuppression, it is unclear if true recompensation can be achieved in such patients. Recompensation of cirrhosis could be an achievable clinical target, offsetting costs of management of advanced liver disease, and decreasing the need for liver transplantation. Consequently, public health policies should pursue programmes that promote alcohol cessation, eliminate viral hepatitis, and address obesity.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

40779766,Alignment Strategies in Total Knee Arthroplasty and How to Effectively Achieve Them.,"Orthopedic surgeons now have multiple alignment strategies for total knee arthroplasty. Unlike the era dominated by mechanical alignment, the availability of diverse paradigms introduces both flexibility and potential uncertainty in selecting optimal lower limb alignment. The published literature does not show marked differences in outcomes between standard mechanical and newer alternative alignment strategies, which is at once reassuring and frustrating. Reassuring because the reliability and durability of total knee arthroplasty appears similar and yet frustrating because comparisons among the techniques often hinge on individual surgeon preferences more than objective data. This review focuses on surgical techniques, highlights differences between mechanical alignment principles and constitutional alignment principles, and compares and contrasts those strategies that primarily focus on coronal plane alignment versus those that deliberately consider three-dimensional alignment. We consider mechanical and anatomic alignment strategies to primarily target coronal plane alignment, whereas kinematic and functional alignment focus on three-dimensional constitutional knee alignment. A clear analysis of the advantages, limitations, and the latest clinical outcomes of each alignment strategy is presented. Using surgical illustrations and insightful tips and tricks, this review aims to serve as a technical guidebook, offering useful insights for clinicians to achieve their desired knee alignment goals.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Nov 01, 2025",2025,Nov,01,Ji B|Guarin Perez S F|Pagnano M W|Sierra R J|Perry K I,Ji B,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN and Department of Orthopedic, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China (Ji), and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Guarin Perez, Pagnano, Sierra, and Perry).","Ji B, Guarin Perez S F, Pagnano M W, Sierra R J, Perry K I",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40779766/,"The key finding of this medical research is that there are multiple alignment strategies available for total knee arthroplasty, and the published literature does not show marked differences in outcomes between the standard mechanical and newer alternative alignment strategies.

The databases included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, and Ovid. A separate search of African Journals Online was conducted using the same Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms as the database search. Additional publications were identified in the references during full-text extraction. The abstracts of all publications were evaluated by two reviewers. The full text was then examined by one reviewer for inclusion. A data extraction tool was used by a single reviewer to document the findings.Sixty-two publications were included in data extraction. Fourteen countries in SSA were represented. Prevalence was reported in eight SSA countries and ranged from 0% to 2.8%. The highest prevalence of 1.2% was found in a cross-sectional study in Banjul, Gambia. Diagnosis in urban areas is often made using slit lamps, although some sites had access to keratometry and/or topography, whereas rural areas use penlight exams alone. Penetrating keratoplasty was reported as an available treatment in 14 manuscripts, glasses and hard contact lenses in 10, and corneal cross-linking in two.

41166105,SAR Disease-focused Panel: Restaging Rectal Cancer MRI Synoptic Report-User Guide with Imaging Review.,"Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for patients with rectal cancer is intended to reduce the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis while preserving quality of life. Choosing the optimal approach after NAT is complex, requiring a personalized plan that considers the unique characteristics of each patient and their tumor, as well as the resources and capabilities of the treating institution. Advances in treatment, guided by insights from randomized clinical trials and increasing acceptance of organ preservation strategies, also known as nonoperative management or the watch-and-wait approach, emphasize the importance of precise treatment response assessment and multidisciplinary communication. A comprehensive evaluation using digital rectal examination, endoscopy, and MRI with a dedicated rectal cancer protocol ensures accurate clinical and locoregional response assessment. This integrative approach enables clinicians to make decisions regarding organ preservation, surgery, treatment de-escalation, or even additional NAT, with MRI having a critical role in surgical planning when resection is needed. The authors provide a comprehensive guide for interpreting postneoadjuvant rectal cancer MRI and applying the Society of Abdominal Radiology Colorectal and Anal Cancer Disease-focused Panel (SAR DFP) synoptic MRI restaging report template. The aim is to improve the quality, consistency, and clarity of MRI interpretations across different readers and institutions. Each section corresponds to the SAR DFP synoptic MRI restaging report template, addressing common areas of confusion and providing essential background material to ensure that clinically relevant information is clearly communicated to the treatment team, supporting effective decision making and enhancing patient outcomes. ©RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",Radiographics,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Sheedy S P|Arya S|Baheti A D|Chang K J|Gollub M J|El Homsi M|Kassam Z|Khatri G|Kim D H|Lalani T|Lee S|Nougaret S|Paroder V|Rauch G M|Wasnik A P|Weiser M R|Horvat N,Sheedy S P|Horvat N,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Radiodiagnosis, Tata Memorial Centre and Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.|Department of Radiology, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Mass.|Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.|Department of Medical Imaging, Schulich School of Medicine, Western University, St Joseph's Hospital, London, Ontario, Canada.|Department of Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Tex.|Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wis.|Department of Radiology, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School/U Mass Memorial Health Care, Worcester, Mass.|Department of Radiological Sciences, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, Calif.|Department of Radiology, PINKCC lab U1194, IRCM, Montpellier Cancer Institute, Montpellier, France.|Department of Abdominal Imaging, Division of Diagnostic Imaging, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex.|Department of Radiology, University of Michigan-Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Mich.|Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.","Sheedy S P, Arya S, Baheti A D, Chang K J, Gollub M J, El Homsi M, Kassam Z, Khatri G, Kim D H, Lalani T, Lee S, Nougaret S, Paroder V, Rauch G M, Wasnik A P, Horvat N, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41166105/,"The key finding of this medical research is the importance of a comprehensive evaluation using digital rectal examination, endoscopy, and MRI with a dedicated rectal cancer protocol to accurately assess the response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer.

However, the oncologic control afforded by RNU may be accompanied by significant renal function decline. Data regarding patients with immediate end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after RNU is limited. Herein, we investigate outcomes of patients undergoing RNU who were dialysis-dependent prior to surgery or rendered anephric by surgery relative to a matched control cohort.We queried our multi-institutional RNU database to identify patients with preoperative ESRD (n = 16) or solitary kidney (n = 12). We matched these 1:2 to a control cohort of RNU patients using age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, and pathologic T-stage. Oncologic and survival outcomes were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.The two groups had similar baseline clinical and oncologic characteristics, including utilization of perioperative systemic therapy. There was no significant difference in time to recurrence or cancer specific mortality. However, the dialysis cohort displayed a higher risk of overall mortality, with 3- and 5-year survival of 29% and 14%, compared to 60% and 57% in the control group (HR 2.13, P = 0.03).Patients undergoing RNU with immediate postoperative ESRD had similar oncologic outcomes but worse overall survival compared to matched controls. These results are likely related to the impact of ESRD and other nononcologic comorbidities, which must factor into treatment decisions. For those who ultimately elect RNU, all efforts should be made to optimize any potentially reversible comorbidities after surgery.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40754267,Piperacillin/tazobactam clearance predicted by non-creatinine based estimates of GFR in critically ill adults.,"As a renally-eliminated beta-lactam antibiotic, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a central component of piperacillin/tazobactam pharmacokinetics. This study aimed to determine the optimal eGFR equation for inclusion in population pharmacokinetic models for piperacillin and tazobactam among critically ill adults.The study included critically ill adults treated with piperacillin/tazobactam at a single academic medical center between 2018 and 2022. Excluded individuals had acute kidney injury, received kidney replacement therapy, or had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at piperacillin/tazobactam initiation. Non-linear mixed effects population pharmacokinetic models using eGFR equations with creatinine, cystatin C, or both were developed and compared.Using 377 samples from 120 critically ill patients, we found that a two-compartment model with first-order elimination best fit the piperacillin data and a one-compartment model with first-order elimination best fit the tazobactam data. For piperacillin, the final population mean parameters (standard error) were 8.36 (0.55) L/h for CL and 12.96 (1.17) L for V1. The values for Q and V2 were fixed at 0.98 L/h and 18 L, respectively, due to low interindividual variation in these parameters. For tazobactam, the final population mean parameters were 8.12 (0.52) L/h for CL and 16.87 (1.44) L for V. Both final models identified eGFRcystatinC expressed in mL/min as the eGFR equation that best predicted drug clearance as a covariate.An eGFR equation that includes cystatin C improves the predictive performance of pharmacokinetic models for piperacillin/tazobactam in critically ill adults.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

40752632,Psoriasis-associated lung disease: A comprehensive review and case series.,"Psoriasis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the skin and joints. Growing evidence suggests an association with pulmonary comorbidities, though lung involvement remains under characterized. We reviewed the literature and conducted a retrospective analysis to define pulmonary manifestations in psoriasis patients, termed Psoriasis-Associated Lung Disease (Psoriasis-LD).We identified 251 adult psoriasis patients at our academic center (2012-2022) who had chest CT scans and/or pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Data included demographics, psoriasis phenotype/treatment, respiratory symptoms, PFTs, radiographic features, and outcomes. Psoriasis-LD was defined by symptoms and/or CT abnormalities and/or abnormal PFTs. CT findings were categorized as: fibrotic (traction bronchiectasis/honeycombing), airway disease (bronchial wall thickening/bronchiectasis), or ground-glass opacities (GGO)/consolidation. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, group comparisons, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models.The mean patient age was 64.6 ± 14.7 years, with an equal gender distribution (50 % female). Common comorbidities included obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sleep apnea. CT abnormalities included pulmonary ground-glass opacification or consolidation (25.1 %), airway disease (8-9 %), and interstitial fibrosis (3-7 %), with over half of the patients displaying any one of these features. Airway disease and GGO were strongly linked to death or transplant (HR 2.07, 2.50, respectively). Follow-up showed that 39 % of patients died or received lung transplants. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was confirmed in 8.8 %, mainly NSIP and UIP patterns and most patients with ILD had additional risk factors.Pulmonary abnormalities frequently occur in psoriasis patients and correlate with poorer outcomes, suggesting that psoriasis may be a significant risk factor for pulmonary complications. Earlier detection and multidisciplinary management are essential to improving patient outcomes.Copyright © 2025.

40752051,Pediatric pickleball injuries: A multi-center database analysis of emergency department visits.,"Pickleball is a rapidly growing sport, with participation increasing from 4.8 million players in 2021 to 19.8 million in 2024 in the United States. While injury patterns in adults have been studied, pediatric injury patterns remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to examine the epidemiology of pediatric pickleball injuries presenting to emergency departments (EDs) across the United States.A retrospective analysis was conducted using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database from 2014 to 2024. Pickleball-related injuries were identified via narrative searches. Demographic information, injury type, and mechanism were recorded. Univariable logistic regression evaluated associations between age and injury characteristics.An estimated 3011 pediatric pickleball injuries occurred nationally, 58.4 % occurring in 2024. Most injuries were to males (61.4 %) and to children between 13 and 17 years old (57.4 %). Facial Injuries (27.1 %) and lacerations (23.8 %) were the most frequent types of injuries. Younger children were more likely to sustain a laceration (OR: 0.84, 95 % CI: 0.72-0.98, p = 0.03), and older players were more likely to suffer an injury to the knee (OR: 1.46, 95 % CI: 1.11-2.05, p = 0.01) or shoulder (OR: 1.82, 95 % CI: 1.13-3.77, p = 0.04). Only 4 % of injuries resulted in hospitalization.Pediatric pickleball injuries show age-specific trends: younger children are more prone to lacerations, while older children experience more joint injuries, although all injuries tend to be mild. As participation grows, understanding these trends is critical for developing age-targeted safety measures and prevention strategies.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40750497,Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy with or Without Metastasis-directed Therapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The Multicenter Phase 2 Randomized EXTEND Trial.,"Oligometastatic prostate cancer (omPC) is characterized by limited metastases. We hypothesized that metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) to all sites of omPC combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) would improve clinical outcomes.In the multicenter phase 2 EXTEND trial, patients with omPC were randomized 1:1 to ADT versus MDT + ADT in two independently powered and randomized baskets, one using intermittent ADT and one using continuous ADT. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included radiologic PFS (rPFS) and castration resistance-free survival (CRFS). Here, the primary results of the continuous ADT basket, the combined analysis of both baskets, and translational immune correlatives are reported.From September 2018 through August 2022, 174 patients were randomized and were eligible for the primary analysis. In the continuous ADT basket (N = 87), the median PFS was 47 mo with MDT + ADT versus 22 mo with ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; one-sided p = 0.036). In the combined analysis, the median PFS was 36 mo with MDT + ADT versus 17 mo with ADT (HR, 0.45; p < 0.001). Radiologic PFS and CRFS were also superior with MDT + ADT. Durable clinical responses after MDT + ADT were associated with systemic Th1-polarizing cytokine upregulation and CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Compared with ADT, MDT + ADT induced greater systemic immune activation, including T-cell receptor expansion/contraction, which we also observed in the independent ORIOLE trial of MDT. The greatest PFS benefit after MDT + ADT was observed in patients with systemic T-cell receptor expansion/contraction.MDT + ADT improves PFS compared with ADT in omPC patients, meriting phase 3 confirmation. Hypothesis-generating immune responses warrant mechanistic validation and future trials with T-cell-targeted immunotherapies.Copyright © 2025 European Association of Urology.

40744275,Treatment and follow-up of vascular graft and endograft infection: Delphi consensus document.,"Vascular graft or endograft infection (VGEI) is a severe complication requiring a multidisciplinary approach combining surgery and antimicrobial therapy. This study aimed to develop expert consensus on the management and follow-up of VGEI, with a focus on antimicrobial strategies.A modified Delphi method was conducted to reach consensus on key aspects of VGEI care, including antimicrobial treatment, surgical management, and follow-up. An expert panel representing infectious diseases, vascular and cardiothoracic surgery, microbiology, and nuclear medicine participated in four rounds of surveys. Ten general and 35 specific statements were rated using a five-point Likert scale. Statements with ≥75% agreement (agree/strongly agree) were considered to have achieved consensus. Internal consistency across rounds was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (>0.80).The panel agreed that empirical antimicrobial therapy should be initiated only in patients with complications (e.g. sepsis and bleeding) or when diagnostic intervention is delayed. Empirical therapy must be individualized based on graft location and risk factors. For abdominal VGEI without aorto-enteric fistula and unknown pathogens, initial coverage should target gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes, with consideration for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)/Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) based on risk. For thoracic VGEI without fistula, gram-positive coverage is prioritized, with optional MRSA coverage. Postoperative treatment duration should be individualized. In cases of complete graft removal and replacement with autologous veins, a 6-week antibiotic course is recommended, with early oral switch if bioavailable options are available. If prosthetic material remains, at least 4 to 6 weeks of intravenous therapy followed by oral treatment for a total of 12 weeks is advised. Prolonged therapy should be considered in cases with virulent pathogens, incomplete source control, or persistent inflammatory markers. The study provides practical, expert-based antimicrobial guidance for VGEI management and emphasizes the importance of individualized, microbiologically informed therapy within a multidisciplinary care framework.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40680199,Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes of Individuals Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy.,"Cardiovascular management of patients who receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is evolving as new medications and practice patterns emerge. We sought to identify factors associated with treatment-onset major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients undergoing ADT.This was a retrospective cohort of patients at a multicenter academic institution prescribed pharmacologic ADT from January 2018 to March 2024. Patients using leuprolide or degarelix were stratified into pre-relugolix (January 2018-November 2020) and post-relugolix (December 2020-March 2024) eras. MACE was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular-associated death.One thousand one hundred twenty-eight and 1398 patients were prescribed leuprolide in the pre-relugolix and post-relugolix era, respectively. Eighty patients were prescribed degarelix, and 367 patients were prescribed relugolix. The incidence of treatment-onset MACE in the pre-relugolix era was 5.4% and 8.3% for leuprolide and degarelix, respectively. Incidence in the post-relugolix era was 2.3%, 3.6%, and 2.1% for leuprolide, degarelix, and relugolix, respectively. Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR 1.12, CI 1.06-1.18, P < .001) and prior MACE (HR 5.32, CI 3.36-8.42, P < .001) were associated with increased risk of treatment-onset MACE. While patients with a history of previous MACE were more likely to be managed by cardiology while receiving ADT (55% vs 23%, P < .001), 27% lacked care from cardiology or primary care during therapy and received cardioprotective therapies.A history of heart attack or stroke is significantly associated with increased risk of MACE after initiating ADT. Relugolix was not associated with lower risk of MACE in our analysis.

The scope of this guideline includes the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after TJA. The population was limited to patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty because of a paucity of data on patients with other orthopaedic implants. Based on the best current available evidence, this guideline contains five options to assist all qualified clinicians, including orthopaedic surgeons and dental providers, considering the prevention of total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations.

However, key challenges remain, including optimizing hematologic response pre-kidney transplant and managing immunosuppression to mitigate recurrence and avoid infection complications. Ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential to refine transplant selection, integrate biomarkers for risk stratification, and develop tailored post-kidney transplant surveillance. These efforts may increase access to kidney transplant and improve outcomes for patients with plasma cell dyscrasia and end-stage kidney disease.Copyright © 2025 International Society of Nephrology.

40736623,Discontinuation of levothyroxine therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a pilot randomized clinical trial.,"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown no benefit of levothyroxine for subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in improving well-being, cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality. We aimed to evaluate study procedures' feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of levothyroxine discontinuation in adults with SCH.We conducted a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with 6-month follow-up at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Adults with SCH on levothyroxine ≤75 mcg daily were randomized to continue levothyroxine or switch to placebo. The primary outcome was feasibility.Fifty participants were randomized (32% enrollment rate); five were excluded post-randomization due to unconfirmed SCH, yielding 45 participants (21 levothyroxine, 24 placebo). One patient in the placebo group withdrew for personal reasons (98% completion rate). Participants' mean age was 68.2 years (SD 9.7); 80% were male, and 86.7% were White. At 6 months, there was no statistically significant difference between the placebo and levothyroxine groups in ThyPRO-Hypothyroid Symptoms [28.3 (22.8) vs. 22.9 (19.5)], Tiredness [27.6 (22.8) vs. 32.8 (22.1)], and EQ-5D score [0.750 (0.232) vs. 0.741 (0.180)]. The only notable adverse event was rib fractures in a placebo group participant (TSH 3.04 mIU/L at 6 months). Two participants in the placebo group restarted levothyroxine (n = 1, TSH > 10 mIU/L; n = 1, fatigue).We demonstrated feasibility of study procedures for discontinuing levothyroxine in patients with SCH and obtained preliminary effects on well-being. The low occurrence of adverse events suggests that levothyroxine discontinuation may be well-tolerated. These findings support conducting a larger multi-site RCT to comprehensively assess the effects of levothyroxine discontinuation.NCT04288115.© 2025.

40734520,Predicting Symptomatic Response to Prokinetic Treatment Using Gastric Alimetry.,"Chronic neurogastroduodenal disorders are challenging to manage, with therapy often initiated on a trial and error basis. Prokinetics play a significant role in management, but responses are variable and have been associated with adverse events, impacting widespread use. We investigated whether body surface gastric mapping (BSGM) biomarkers (using Gastric Alimetry) could inform patient selection for prokinetic therapy.Patients with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms taking oral prokinetic agents, regardless of gastric emptying status, were prospectively recruited and underwent BSGM (30 m baseline, 482 kcal standardized meal, 4 h postprandial recording) while off-prokinetic agents. Patients were followed up with daily symptom diaries. A subset was compared to matched patients not taking prokinetic agents. Prokinetic responders were defined based on symptom improvement greater than a minimum clinically important difference methodology.Forty-two patients (88% female; median age 36; median BMI 26) taking prokinetics were analyzed. Prokinetic prescribing, compared to matched patients, was independent of BSGM metrics (p > 0.15). In patients on existing prokinetics (withheld for BSGM), lower amplitudes predicted reduced symptom burden, whereas low rhythm stability predicted a worse symptom burden (p < 0.05). In prokinetic-naive patients (i.e., started on a prokinetic during the study), a lower postprandial amplitude predicted responders (mean 37.5 ± 10.6 uV in responders [n = 5] vs. mean 54.8 ± 6.6 uV among nonresponders [n = 3], p = 0.047).Gastric Alimetry biomarkers may help in the prediction of prokinetic response in patients with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms. Lower postprandial amplitudes, indicating a reduced meal response, appear to predict benefit, while impaired rhythm stability predicted poorer therapeutic response.© 2025 The Author(s).

40729536,Ultrasound-Guided Needle Electromyography of the Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus and Brevis Muscles for Preoperative Tendon Transfer Planning in Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries: Technique Description and Case Report.,"Reconstructive surgery, including tendon transfers, can potentially offer marked improvement in function in those with cervical spinal cord injuries. Given the anatomic redundancy of both the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis in producing active wrist extension, one muscle can be utilized as a donor for a tendon transfer without sacrificing wrist extension. Needle electromyography does not routinely evaluate the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis, and the functional status of each muscle is difficult to discern based on clinical exam alone. Here is presented a case of a 20-yr-old man with C6 complete tetraplegia and preserved active wrist extension who underwent a novel ultrasound-guided electromyography technique to accurately and reproducibly assess the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles. This technique was employed to aid his surgeon in determining candidacy for tendon transfer procedures utilizing the wrist extensors as donors. Ultrasound-guided electromyography showed intact volitional activation in both the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis. Subsequent extensor carpi radialis longus to flexor digitorum profundus tendon transfer was pursued, and he had preserved postoperative antigravity wrist extension strength through extensor carpi radialis brevis alone. Accurate assessment of the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis allows for more complete preoperative planning and provides critical information on whether active pinch and grasp reconstruction as possible.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40712774,Rapid post exercise venous refilling time is an independent contributor to chronic venous insufficiency.,"Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) results in complications such as pain, swelling, edema, skin changes, and ulcerations of the lower extremities. Valvular incompetence and venous obstruction are well-recognized contributors to CVI. Post-exercise venous refilling time (P-EVRT), the time to refill veins after calf muscle contractions during venous plethysmography study, is an understudied contributor to CVI.In this cross-sectional study of 4755 patients who were evaluated with venous air plethysmography, 9510 lower limbs were categorized based on P-EVRT into two groups: rapid (<20 seconds; n = 5256) and normal (n = 4254).Rapid P-EVRT was associated with higher mean CEAP scores (3.2 vs 2.5; P < .001) and a higher prevalence of active/prior ulcers (11.6 vs 4.1%; P < .001). Univariable analysis showed that age, male sex, the severity of incompetence, obstruction, calf pump function, and rapid P-EVRT were all significantly associated with active/prior ulcers. After multivariable adjustment for these significant factors, rapid P-EVRT was an independent contributor to active/prior ulcers (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.77). Among limbs without other venous pathology by plethysmography (incompetence, obstruction, reduced calf pump function), rapid P-EVRT remained significantly associated with higher mean CEAP scores (P < .001) and a higher prevalence of venous ulcers than limbs with normal P-EVRT (5.7% vs 2.7%; P = .001).In this large contemporary study using venous air plethysmography, we demonstrate that rapid P-EVRT is an important and unique venous physiologic parameter that informs our understanding of the clinical severity of CVI.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40709921,Does Femoral Rotation More Closely Mirror the Contralateral Side or a Population Mean of 15 Degrees of Anteversion? A Radiologic Study of 219 Healthy Patients.,"To compare whether femoral version more closely mirrors the contralateral femur or a population norm estimate of 15 degrees of anteversion.Radiologic observational study.Level I Trauma Center.Patients with no history of anatomy-altering femoral injury who underwent bilateral lower extremity computed tomography scans.Computed tomographies were analyzed to measure femoral version on each side. The asymmetry in femoral version between left and right in each patient (interfemoral rotational variance [IRV]) was recorded. The difference of each femur's version from a proposed population mean of 15 degrees of anteversion was also recorded.A total of 219 patients with a mean femoral version of 14.9 degrees ± 10.5 degrees of anteversion were included. Mean IRV was 5.3 degrees, compared with 8.2 degrees of mean variation from the population norm of 15 degrees of anteversion ( P < 0.001). Five percent of patients had IRV >15 degrees compared with 15% that had femoral rotation >15 degrees from the population mean of 15 degrees ( P < 0.001).In the setting of a comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture, knowledge of the appropriate target for restoration of rotational alignment is critical. This radiologic cohort study found that on average, femoral version more closely mirrors an individual patient's contralateral femur as opposed to a population norm of 15 degrees of anteversion.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40702965,Evaluation of Brain Stiffness in Patients Undergoing Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting Using Magnetic Resonance Elastography.,"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) in patients with carotid stenosis may have potential effects on brain parenchyma. However, current studies on parenchymal changes are scarce due to the need for advanced imaging modalities. Consequently, the alterations in brain parenchyma following PTAS remain an unsolved issue.To investigate changes to the brain parenchyma using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).Prospective.13 patients (6 women and 7 men; 39 MRI imaging sessions) with severe unilateral carotid stenosis patients indicated for PTAS were recruited between 2021 and 2024.Noncontrast MRI sequences including MRE (spin echo) were acquired using 3 T scanners.All patients underwent MRE before (preprocedural), within 24 h (early postprocedural) and 3 months after (delayed postprocedural) PTAS. Preprocedural and delayed postprocedural ultrasonographic peak systolic velocity (PSV) was recorded. MRE stiffness and damping ratio were evaluated via neural network inversion of the whole brain, in 14 gray matter (GM) and 12 white matter (WM) regions.Stiffness and damping ratio differences between each pair of MR sessions for each subject were identified by paired sample t tests. The correlations of stiffness and damping ratio with stenosis grade and ultrasonographic PSV dynamics were evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficients. The statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.The stiffness of lesion side insula, deep GM, and deep WM increased significantly from preprocedural to delayed postprocedural MRE. Increasing deep GM stiffness on the lesion side was positively correlated with the DSA stenosis grade significantly (r = 0.609). The lesion side insula stiffness increments were positively correlated with PSV decrements significantly (r = 0.664).Regional brain stiffness increased 3 months after PTAS. Lesion side stiffness was positively correlated with stenosis grades in deep GM and PSV decrements in the insula.

40683397,Hospital transfer and associated outcomes in acute limb ischemia.,"Timely access to care is critical in time-dependent pathologies such as acute limb ischemia (ALI). Interhospital transfer may increase access to specialist care but at the risk of increasing time to revascularization. The aim of this study is to explore associations between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients presenting with ALI, with the goal of generating hypotheses for future prospective research.A retrospective analysis was performed using survey-weighted data from the National Inpatient Sample database (2019-2021). Patients aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized with ALI, based on International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision codes, were analyzed. Outcomes including comorbid conditions, methods of revascularization, limb salvage, organ failure, and mortality. Comparisons were made between patients undergoing transfer or not as part of their care. The χ2 test was used for univariate comparison and multivariate modeling used to control for covariates. Comparisons are presented using proportions and odds ratio [95% confidence intervals] (P values).Among 33,434 survey-weighted cases of ALI, 7950 patients (24%) were transferred to another facility. Transfers were significantly more common in micropolitan (3.2 [3.0-3.4]; P < .001) and noncore areas (2.5 [2.3-2.7]; P < .001) when compared with large central and fringe metropolitan areas. Transferred patients exhibited higher rates of primary amputation (4.7% vs 2.7%, P < .0001) and amputation after attempted revascularization (4.6% vs 2.5%, P < .0001). Transferred patients underwent higher rates of surgical thrombectomy (46.5% vs 38.7% P < .001), fasciotomies (3.1% vs 2.1%, P < .001), and hemodialysis (2.4% vs 1.5%, P < .001). Transferred patients had a higher in-hospital mortality (8.6% vs 4.4%, P < .001) than those who were not transferred.Patients presenting with ALI who require hospital transfer have higher mortality and morbidity than patients undergoing definitive care on index admission. The reason for these finding is likely multifactorial and include disease complexity, prolonged warm ischemic times, and vascular surgical workforce distribution. Although expanding the vascular surgery workforce in underserved areas would be ideal, this remains unlikely in the short term. Although our findings are associative, they highlight the need for further research to clarify the drivers of poor outcomes. In the interim, practical strategies such as leveraging technology to reduce ischemic time during transfers and implementing emergency department-based activation protocols for ALI may help address current care delays.Copyright © 2025 Society for Vascular Surgery.

40681844,Metabolic plasticity: an evolutionary perspective on metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder.,"The emerging field of metabolic psychiatry has brought mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction into focus in bipolar disorder research. In this manuscript, we propose that the metabolic features of bipolar disorder provide a new vector from which to understand the role of circadian dysfunction in this condition. A notable feature of bipolar disorder is the photoperiod driven, seasonal occurrence of symptoms and episodes mediated by circadian systems, with mania occurring more frequently in the spring and autumn at times of rapid rate of change in photoperiod, and depression being more prevalent in the winter when photoperiod is attenuated. In this manuscript we note that seasonal adaptations in metabolism are highly conserved evolutionary traits across diverse taxa. Several of the underlying mechanisms mediating seasonal changes in metabolism are conserved in human biology and are implicated in bipolar disorder pathophysiology. Such mechanisms encompass targets of lithium involved in insulin signaling (the phosphatidylinositol cycle, GSK3β and Akt), clock genes (CLOCK and BMAL1), targets of psychiatric and metabolic medications (mTOR and AMPK) and hormonal signaling (melatonin and cortisol). We propose that bipolar disorder may represent a dysregulation of conserved mechanisms of chronometabolic regulation and provide a discussion of the evolutionary context of such mechanisms. Genetic predisposition coupled to novel environmental inputs to human biology including artificial light at night and sustained refined sugar and carbohydrate intake may contribute to states of metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder underlying episodes of mania and depression.© 2025.

40514007,Acute carbamoylated erythropoietin reduces social stress-induced anxiety and depression-related behaviors.,"The hormone and trophic factor Erythropoietin (EPo) promotes red blood cell production and has neurotrophic effects, modulating behavior and promoting neural plasticity, like neurogenesis. Modifying EPo by attaching a carbamoyl group (cEPo) results in similar neuronal effects without erythropoietic actions. We hypothesize that neuroplastic and learning effects of cEPo may be dependent on its action in dorsal dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis occurs. The Stress Alternatives Model (SAM) is a 4-day social stress and decision-making paradigm with a large novel aggressor that provides opportunities to avoid interaction via escape routes. Early, male test mice display stable Escape (avoiding aggression) or Stay (acquiescence to aggressor) behavioral phenotypes. In these studies, mice were given a single intracerebroventricular (icv; 100 ng), or single intra-dentate gyrus (iDG; 10 ng) injection of cEPo or vehicle. By Day 4, 30% of icv cEPo treated mice and 37.5% of iDG cEPo treated mice reversed their phenotype (Stay to Escape). Mice receiving vehicle injections did not change. Normalization of social preference, and reduction in fear freezing behavior, after cEPo treatment, coincide with transcriptional changes of orexin receptors (Hcrtr1 & Hcrtr2) in the hippocampus, including phenotype- and treatment-dependent alterations in learning-associated molecular signaling molecules. Hippocampal Hcrtr1 moderately colocalize with EPo receptors (Epor) in the dentate gyrus, while Hcrtr2 is expressed with Epor in CA1.

40505172,Assessment of choroidal melanoma and nevus lesions using ultrasound vibro-elastography and parametric imaging approach.,"The purpose of this study was to assess eye lesions by analyzing wave speed (WS) of lesions using ultrasound vibro-elastography (UVE) together with a parametric ultrasound imaging approach. Ten subjects with eye lesions (5 nevus (N) vs. 5 melanoma (M)) were recruited and tested using UVE. In addition, the sliding window method was used to reconstruct and analyze horizontal Normalized Shannon Entropy (hNSE) images and Nakagami-m/omega images. Two-way ANOVA statistical analysis was performed to compare mean values of the contrast to noise ratio (CNR), hNSE, and m/omega of these images between the two types of lesions. The results show that there were significant differences in CNR of the m map images (p = 0.0174) and omega map images (p = 0.0128) reconstructed from shear wave velocity (SWV) between the two types of lesions and significant differences in CNR of the m map images (p = 0.0209) and omega map images (p < 0.0001) reconstructed from two dimensional (2D) speed maps between the two lesions Furthermore, the m values of 2D speed maps shows significant differences between N vs. M of all three frequencies (i.e., 100 Hz (p = 0.0052), 150 Hz (p = 0.0100), 200 Hz (p = 0.0174)). The results suggest that CNR, m and omega of Nakagami method are useful biomarkers for assessing eye lesion with UVE technique. Nakagami imaging of SWV and 2D speed maps have better performance than hNSE imaging for analyzing characteristics of eye lesions. UVE based Nakagami imaging is a promising method for evaluating eye lesions.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

40788427,Trends in atrial fibrillation-related mortality among adults under 65 years in the USA.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the USA, contributing to increased risks of mortality and adverse cardiovascular events. While AF is predominantly seen in older adults, over 20% of cases occur in individuals younger than 65 years.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using de-identified data from the CDC WONDER database, covering all US deaths from 1999 to 2020. AF-related deaths were identified using ICD-10 codes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were calculated per 1 million population, standardized to the 2000 US census. Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.From 1999 to 2020, 137,808 AF-related deaths were recorded among adults aged 15-64 years. The AAMR rose from 14.0 in 1999 to 50.5 by 2020, reflecting a 6.3% annual increase. Adults aged 45-54 years showed the highest annual increase (6.7%), followed by adults aged 35-44 years (6.6%), and adults aged 55-64 years (6.2%). Males had a higher AAMR than females (35.4 vs 16.2). Non-Hispanic Blacks had the highest AAMR among racial groups (37.4). Rural areas showed higher AAMRs than urban areas (30.3 vs 24.6). AAMR varied widely across states, with Oklahoma having the highest rate (46.7).AF-related mortality among younger US adults has significantly increased in the last 2 decades. The findings highlight the shifting epidemiology of AF, with middle-aged adults showing the highest annual increases.© 2025.

40058746,Real-World Effectiveness and Safety of Upadacitinib in Crohn's Disease: A Multicenter Study.,"We aimed to describe the real-world effectiveness and safety of upadacitinib (UPA), an oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).A retrospective analysis was conducted across 9 centers in the United States, focusing on adults with CD treated with UPA, 45 mg, as induction therapy for active luminal disease. The coprimary end points were clinical remission at 12 weeks (Harvey Bradshaw Index ≤4 or absence of symptoms on physician's global assessment) and endoscopic remission at 6 months (Simplified Endoscopic Mucosal Assessment for Crohn's Disease score of 0-1 or absence of ulcers). Secondary outcomes included clinical, radiographic, and histologic outcomes, and adverse events.The study included 334 patients with CD (median age, 34 years; disease duration, 12 years; 44.6% female). Clinical remission was achieved in 52.1% at 12 weeks and 55.9% at 6 months. Endoscopic remission at 6 months was observed in 42.7% of patients. Advanced therapy-naive patients achieved a higher proportion of clinical remission at 12 weeks (58.6%) and 6 months (97.7%) compared with patients with 1 prior advanced therapy (53.3% and 66.7%) and 2 or more prior advanced therapy exposures (50.2% and 40.5%), respectively. Body mass index and longer disease duration was associated with lower odds of clinical remission at 12 weeks. Adverse events were reported in 13.5% and UPA discontinued in 19.1%.UPA was effective at inducing clinical and endoscopic remission in a real-world group of patients with CD, even with prior exposure to multiple prior advanced therapies.

40287350,Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis in the United States: Evidence From Real-World Clinical Practice.,"This study described real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis in the United States (US).De-identified chart review data were obtained from 117 adult patients diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis (01/01/2014-12/31/2021) who initiated 1 L treatment, outside of a clinical trial setting, on or after January 1, 2014, and received ≥ 1 treatment at a US medical center.Among patients, (median age: 63.2 years; female: 50.4%; White: 73.5%; Black/African American: 14.5%), most patients received 2 or more lines of treatment (62.4%) with 30.8% receiving 2 lines of treatment, predominantly cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD)-, daratumumab-, and dexamethasone-based regimens. In first-line, one third of patients had hematologic response (complete response [CR]: 31.6%; very good partial response (29.1%); for later lines, CR rates tended to decrease. By 57.5 months, ≥60% of patients were still alive (Kaplan-Meier rates - 12 months: 92.0%; 24 months: 84.4%). Median progression-free survival (41.4 months), event-free survival (24.4 months), and time to next treatment (43.2 months) were unexpectedly longest in second line.The study demonstrated that there was heterogeneity in the treatment of AL amyloidosis, and patients who receive treatment can survive for several years after diagnosis without progression.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40184308,Profiling Postpartum Recovery After Scheduled Cesarean Delivery With Neuraxial Anesthesia: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.,"Childbirth can have a substantial impact on maternal health-related quality of life. Cesarean delivery is the most performed inpatient operation, yet little is known about normal postpartum recovery profiles. The primary aim of our study was to longitudinally evaluate global health visual analog scale (GHVAS; 0-100) scores up to 12 weeks after scheduled cesarean delivery and identify the time to plateau of scores. The secondary aims were to evaluate different domains of postpartum recovery using validated patient-reported outcome measures (Obstetric Quality of Recovery score [ObsQoR-10] and 5-level 5-dimensional EuroQol questionnaire [EQ-5D]).After institutional review board approval, this single-center, prospective longitudinal study enrolled healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery. Women were excluded for gestational age <32 weeks, neonatal demise, neonatal intensive care unit admission, inability to read or understand English, and if general anesthesia was used. Women completed baseline surveys before delivery and then at 24 and 48 hours after delivery. After hospital discharge, women completed surveys (including GHVAS, OBsQoR-10, EQ-5D, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and activities of daily living) at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks postpartum. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect the difference in GHVAS and postpartum recovery outcomes with different follow-up time points.We enrolled 66 parturients and 3 were withdrawn. Response rates were 95%, 84%, 83%, and 76% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks, respectively. Mean ± standard deviation [SD] GHVAS scores were 78 ± 16 at baseline, 64 ± 17 at 24 hours, 69 ± 15 at 48 hours, 75 ± 19 at 1 week, 88 ± 11 at 3 weeks, 88 ± 15 at 6 weeks, and 90 ± 12 at 12 weeks postpartum ( P < .001). The global health VAS improved up until week 3 and then plateaued close to the maximum score between 3 weeks and 12 weeks postpartum. Mean ± SD ObsQoR-10 scores were 75 ± 15 at 24 hours, 85 ± 10 at 48 hours, and 81 ± 28 at 1 week postpartum ( P = .003). The mean ± SD EQ-5D composite scores improved at 6 weeks (4.9 ± 2.9) and 3 months (4.2 ± 2.6) compared to baseline (6.5 ± 1.8) with usual activities ( P = .001) and pain/discomfort ( P < .001) showing significant improvement over time. ObsQoR-10 score at 24 hours correlated with ObsQoR-10 scores at 48 hours (r = 0.629, P < .001) and 1 week (r = 0.429, P < .001) but did not correlate with EQ-5D scores at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.Our study demonstrates that GHVAS after scheduled CD plateaus at week 3.

Preference weights were estimated for 2 types of attributes that differed between fusion and non-fusion surgery: treatment outcomes (ie, appearance, confidence in planned correction, spinal motion, device failure, reoperation, and recovery period) and procedure-type requirements associated with each surgery type. Correlations between preference weights for patients, caregivers, and dyads were calculated to assess preference concordance between cohorts.ResultsA total of 344 respondents (124 patients, 92 caregivers, and 128 patient/caregiver dyads) completed the survey. Appearance was the most important treatment outcome for the average respondent in all cohorts. For patients, the least important treatment outcome was recovery time, whereas reoperation rate was the least important treatment outcome for caregivers and dyads. After controlling for treatment outcomes, patients and patient-caregiver dyads preferred the procedure-type requirements associated with fusion surgery, while caregivers preferred the procedure-type requirements associated with non-fusion surgery. Preferences of respondents who completed the survey prior to surgery were similar to those who completed the survey after surgery. Patient and caregiver preferences were more similar to the preferences of dyads than to each other.ConclusionsPatients and patient-caregiver dyads preferred the procedure-type requirements associated with fusion surgery, while caregivers preferred the procedure-type requirements associated with non-fusion surgery.

40164298,The effect of wrist flexion/extension on radiocapitellar joint kinematics during valgus extension of the elbow.,"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the capitellum is prevalent among youth baseball pitchers. Repetitive shear forces during pitching are contributing factors. During the acceleration phase of pitching, the wrist joint moves from extension to flexion. The interplay between wrist position and elbow joint biomechanics has not been thoroughly examined, particularly within the radiocapitellar joint. This study aims to elucidate how different wrist positions affect the displacement of compression forces within the radiocapitellar joint during elbow extension and examine the change in contact pressure during simulated active wrist flexion and extension.Seven fresh frozen cadaveric upper limbs were mounted in a custom testing machine and tested under simulated throwing conditions. Radial head motion was tracked using an intra-articular thin-film pressure transducer mounted on the capitellum. The contact pressure and location of the center of force (COF) in the radiocapitellar joint were measured during 3 wrist positions by loading the wrist flexors and extensors: flexion, neutral, and extension.Wrist flexion, compared to the neutral wrist position, displaced the COF significantly medially between 60° and 30° of elbow flexion (P < .05). Wrist extension slightly directed the COF laterally compared to the neutral wrist, but the differences were not significant. The total horizontal displacement between the COF during active wrist flexion and extension ranged from 1.6 mm to 1.8 mm. Mean contact pressure was significantly higher with the wrist in extension from 80° to 40° of elbow flexion and significantly lower with wrist flexion only at a 90° of elbow flexion (P < .05).This study demonstrated that simulated active wrist flexion shifts the COF medially, potentially reducing the risk of lateral OCD lesions. In contrast, wrist extension increases contact pressure, explaining the higher susceptibility to loading in the lateral compartment. These findings highlight the importance of wrist dynamics in pitching mechanics and suggest that minimizing wrist extension during practice may prevent OCD development.Wrist positions significantly influence the biomechanical behavior of the radiocapitellar joint during elbow extension.

40131000,Optimizing liver transplant candidacy in patients with cirrhosis and obesity.,"The epidemic of obesity in the United States has led to a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity in the liver transplant population, with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease becoming one of the most common indications for liver transplantation. Despite this rise in obesity, the optimal management strategies in the pretransplant, peritransplant, and posttransplant phases of care have not yet been determined. In the current review, we will present and discuss the available evidence for the surgical management of obesity, including the optimal timing, as well as a review of the novel medical therapies and how these strategies may best be utilized to provide ideal long-term outcomes for liver transplant patients with obesity.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Liver Transpl,"Nov 01, 2025",2025,Nov,01,Ha N B|Heimbach J K|Hameed B,Heimbach J K,"Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.|Department of Surgery, Division of Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ha N B, Heimbach J K, Hameed B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131000/,The study examines the best ways to manage obesity in liver transplant patients.

40072382,Outcomes of Older Adults With Delirium Discharged From the Emergency Department.,"To compare 30-day mortality and return emergency department (ED) visits among older adults with delirium who are discharged home with those discharged home without delirium and those who are admitted to the hospital with and without delirium.Adults aged 75 and older years were assessed for delirium using the Delirium Triage Screen followed by the Brief Confusion Assessment Method. We evaluated outcomes including return visits and 30-day mortality. Models were adjusted by age, sex, dementia, Modified Early Warning Score, and ED length of stay and summarized with adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The study included 22,940 visits. Among them, 202 (0.9%) delirium-positive patients were discharged, and 730 (3.2%) were admitted to the hospital to non-ICU and nonmonitored beds. Discharged patients with delirium had higher 30-day mortality (aRR 2.86, 95% CI 2.04 to 4.00) and were more likely to return to the ED within 30 days (aRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.61) compared with those discharged without delirium. Discharged delirium-positive patients were more likely to return to the ED within 30 days than hospitalized delirium-positive patients (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.92), though they experienced lower 30-day mortality (aRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93). Age, sex, Modified Early Warning Score, dementia, and length of stay were not associated with mortality or ED return.Patients discharged with delirium experienced a 3-fold increase in mortality within 30 days compared with those discharged without delirium. These findings suggest a need for more precise discharge criteria and enhanced follow-up care for delirious patients to improve safety. Implementing structured screening and tailored postdischarge support could reduce adverse outcomes in this population.Copyright © 2025 American College of Emergency Physicians.

40320589,Combined Heart and Liver Transplantation in the Failing Fontan: Systematic Review and Single-arm Meta-analysis.,"The Fontan procedure has transformed the management of congenital heart defects characterized by single ventricle physiology, yet it predisposes individuals to Fontan-associated liver disease. Combined heart and liver transplantation (CHLT) emerges as a therapeutic option, but evidence of its efficacy and safety remains limited. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate CHLT in Fontan patients, focusing on patient characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and posttransplant morbidity and mortality.Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. Studies meeting the intervention of CHLT in Fontan patients were included, and data were collected and synthesized using proportion meta-analysis techniques. Statistical analysis was carried out using R software.Four studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 67 Fontan patients undergoing CHLT. All included studies were observational retrospective cohorts performed in the United States. The 1-y survival rate post-CHLT was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70%-98%). Liver graft rejection rates were low, 4% (95% CI, 0%-22%), and no heart graft rejection greater than mild was reported. Postoperative complications included acute kidney injury 75% (95% CI, 50%-93%), temporary dialysis 27% (95% CI, 9%-51%), neurologic events 7% (95% CI, 0%-26%), infection 23% (95% CI, 3%-55%), and unplanned medical procedures 40% (95% CI, 23%-59%).CHLT in Fontan patients demonstrates promising survival rates, but graft rejection and postoperative complications pose challenges. The rate of renal complications is particularly notable and requires further evaluation. Future research should prioritize comparative different management strategies and long-term follow-up to refine protocols and optimize outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40014801,Design and Staged Implementation of a Multidisciplinary Preoperative Anemia Clinic at a Tertiary Care Medical Center.,"Preoperative anemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes in surgical patients. There is limited information to guide the design and implementation of preoperative anemia clinics (PAC), which represents a critical barrier to entry for many practices.This is a descriptive observational study highlighting the design and implementation of a multidisciplinary PAC, including key steps in planning, stakeholder engagement, organizational structure, identification of target populations, establishing anemia treatments, information technology and electronic health record integration, provider training, and data infrastructure. Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and anemia treatments for individuals evaluated in the PAC from November 4, 2019 through September 15, 2023 are enumerated. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing changes in anemia symptoms and well-being after surgery are evaluated for 2 subsets of patients (one before PAC implementation [pre-PAC], another after PAC implementation [post-PAC]), without formal statistical comparison given limited sample sizes.The PAC was initiated as a multidisciplinary effort under support from a Mayo Clinic Practice Transformation Award in 2019, including broad representation from anesthesiology, surgery, and medical practices, along with institutional project management support (eg, project manager, information technologists, systems engineers). While initially limited to cardiac surgery patients, the PAC underwent planned incremental expansion to include other surgical services. Over the study period, 1188 PAC consultations across 1159 unique patients met eligibility criteria, with a median age of 66 (57-73) years and 58.1% women. The most common etiology of anemia was iron deficiency (69.1%) followed by anemia related to cancer (17.3%). Anemia-directed therapies were recommended in 1038 (87.4%) encounters, with 730 (70.3%) of those receiving recommended treatment preoperatively. Seven hundred nine (97.1%) treatments included intravenous iron and 146 (20.0%) included erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Fifteen pre-PAC and 38 post-PAC implementation patients completed PROs. PAC implementation was accompanied by earlier resolution of anemia symptoms and less pronounced declines in postoperative well-being scores.This report highlights the key steps for successful PAC implementation. Treatment is possible for most patients and may be accompanied by improvements in patient-important outcomes.Copyright © 2025 International Anesthesia Research Society.",Anesthesia and analgesia,"Nov 01, 2025",2025,Nov,01,Crispell E H|Cassianni C E|Burt J M|Gonzalez J A|Petsch J L|Hanson A C|Robbins K A|Go R S|Crestanello J A|Jacob A K|Kor D J|Warner M A,Crispell E H|Cassianni C E|Burt J M|Gonzalez J A|Petsch J L|Hanson A C|Robbins K A|Go R S|Crestanello J A|Jacob A K|Kor D J|Warner M A,"From the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.|Patient Blood Management Program, Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology, Department of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Crispell E H, Cassianni C E, Burt J M, Gonzalez J A, Petsch J L, Hanson A C, Robbins K A, Go R S, Crestanello J A, Jacob A K, Kor D J, Warner M A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014801/,"This study describes the design and implementation of a preoperative anemia clinic at a major medical center.

This study compares the effectiveness of ""Bullet"" type and ""Banana"" type devices for sagittal plane correction.Patients who underwent 1-level or 2-level TLIF for degenerative pathology at a single tertiary care center were identified. Details were extracted on demographics, interbody dimensions, and preoperative and postoperative lumbopelvic parameters from upright radiographs. Cages were categorized as ""Bullet"" or ""Banana"" type based on morphology and manufacturer description of optimal position. Univariable comparisons between levels treated with ""Bullet"" and ""Banana"" type interbodies were performed. Multivariable linear regression was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative segmental lordosis and change in segmental lordosis.One hundred and ninety eight unique patients (median 66.6 years; [IQR 59.5, 73.7]; 56.6% female) were included with 241 levels treated, of which 114 (52.7%) were treated with ""Banana"" type interbodies and 127 (47.3%) with ""Bullet"" type. ""Banana"" type interbodies afforded both greater postoperative segmental lordosis (8.1 [6.2, 10.7] vs 7.5 [5.2, 9.6]; P = .048) and greater increase in segmental lordosis (3.3 [0.7, 7.0] vs 2.3 [0.1, 4.2]; P = .015). On multivariable linear regression, only preoperative segmental lordosis (β = 0.322 per degree; [0.244, 0.399]; P < .001), implant listed lordosis (β = 0.146 per degree; 95% CI [0.048, 0.244]; P = .004), preoperative pelvic incidence (0.072 per degree; [0.034, 0.111]; P < .001), and use of bilateral TLIF windows (β = 3.133; [1.213, 5.053]; P = .001) were predictive of postoperative segmental lordosis.The present analysis suggests that baseline lumbopelvic anatomy, interbody lordosis, and the use of bilateral TLIF windows are the most important predictors of postoperative segmental lordosis. Use of ""Banana"" vs ""Bullet"" type interbodies was not predictive of segmental lordosis achieved on immediate postoperative upright radiographs. Further work is merited to determine whether the 2 interbody types demonstrate differences regarding subsidence risk or maintenance of correction.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

To address the limitations of CCA treatment, we investigated cell-targeted nanovesicles as a delivery platform for transcriptome-targeting therapeutics.Milk-derived nanovesicles were loaded with short interfering RNAs targeting Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway; LCK, an upstream regulator of YAP; and tafazzin, a protein critical for the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These transcriptome-targeting nanovesicles were decorated with a lipid-coupled RNA aptamer to epithelial cell adhesion molecule, including a tracking fluorophore. In vitro studies were conducted using multiple CCA cell lines. In vivo studies were performed using C57BL/6 and non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice to evaluate delivery and efficacy in both an immunocompetent syngeneic murine and a patient-derived xenograft model. We demonstrated that transcriptome-targeting nanovesicles were selectively taken up by liver tumor cells, which was augmented by the incorporation of a targeting aptamer, and that milk-derived nanovesicles loaded with short interfering RNA effectively downregulated target gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo. Downstream effects of target gene inhibition were observed, including downregulation of YAP-TEAD target genes and an increase in reactive oxygen species production at the mitochondrial level. Administration of transcriptome-targeting nanovesicles targeting YAP, LCK, and tafazzin inhibited CCA growth and further synergized with chemotherapy in 2 preclinical CCA models.Herein, we show that aptamer-directed, nanovesicle-mediated targeting of YAP, LCK, and tafazzin potentiates chemosensitivity in 2 CCA models when delivered using aptamer-guided milk-derived nanovesicles.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

39880274,Bioprosthetic Valve Fracture for Transcatheter Aortic Valve-in-Valve Replacement: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve replacement presents a viable, minimally invasive approach to replacing degraded bioprosthetic surgical valves. The major drawback of this technique is poor hemodynamics in the form of patient-prosthesis mismatch and high transvalvular gradients. This is commonly attributable to the reduced valvular diameter from the transcatheter heart valve fixed inside the degraded bioprosthesis. Maximizing this diameter by bioprosthetic valve fracture occurs through a noncompliant, high-pressure balloon to splay the degraded valve outward. Despite its novelty, this has demonstrated improved hemodynamic outcomes and optimal valvular expansion with slightly increased operative risk. In this review, we highlight the technique of bioprosthetic valve fracture, types of suitable balloons and valves, timing in relation to valve-in-valve implantation, safety and efficacy, implications, and future directions.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Utilizing longitudinal data (N = 247), the current study examined maternal and offspring history of childhood maltreatment (CM) as predictors of offspring cortisol/DHEA ratios, and, in exploratory analyses, extended this longitudinally to offspring depressive symptoms in young adulthood. Youth (ages 8-13 years) initially attended a research camp, then were followed up approximately eight years later (ages 18-22 years). Maternal history of CM significantly predicted their offspring's childhood cortisol/DHEA ratio over and above the effects of the offspring's history of CM. Offspring CM was not a significant predictor of the ratio. The cortisol/DHEA ratio did not mediate the relationship between maternal history of CM and offspring emerging adulthood depression. Results highlight an intergenerational cascade of CM and negative outcomes and support inclusion of maternal experiences in screening for at-risk youth.",Child maltreatment,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Levin R Y|Russotti J|Toth S L|Cicchetti D|Handley E D,Levin R Y|Russotti J|Toth S L|Cicchetti D|Handley E D,"Mt.

39875745,Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG): indications and results-a systematic review.,"Obesity is a major global health problem and at the same time a financial burden for social security systems. For a long time, conventional lifestyle interventions have tried unsuccessfully to find a solution. It has been proven that only interventions that ultimately address the central control centers of hunger, appetite and satiety will lead to sustained weight loss. As a result, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has become the gold standard in the treatment of obesity and has been shown to be effective and safe in both the short and long term. Processed via the gut-brain axis, MBS not only leads to weight loss, but also-and, in addition, independently through the modification of the intestinal tract in bypass surgery-to a significant remission rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the typical co-morbidity of obesity. However, MBS is not suitable for all patients. Some patients are ineligible due to a high-risk profile or do not wish to undergo surgery, whilst others do not meet the criteria for MBS but still suffer from obesity. This treatment gap has been a driving force behind the development of endoscopic solutions such as endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG). ESG offers a less invasive, endoluminal and anatomy-sparing alternative that reduces gastric volume by suturing tissue folds along the greater curvature. Such a reduction in gastric volume, which is also one principle of action of MBS, can induce earlier satiety and lead to weight loss. The evidence behind this procedure, in particular its efficacy and safety, should be objectified through this review.© 2025.

Not so fast: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is rising in incidence with a high mortality burden. While corticosteroids are recommended for eligible patients with severe AH, no guidance exists for the timing of steroid initiation, tapering regimens, and surveillance of adverse events. We aim to systematically review these variables and provide evidence-based recommendations for the inpatient and outpatient management of severe AH.We performed a literature search from inception to May 30, 2024, to include clinical trials published in full form and assessed the quality of evidence using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were collected on the timing of initiation, rate, and complications following steroid therapy, and taper regimens in the setting of severe AH. Of 28 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, the median time from admission to steroid initiation was 6.5 days. The most common steroid dosing regimen was prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days. Twenty-five studies containing 3196 subjects reported adverse events, with exactly 50% in the steroid arm and the other half in the comparison arm.

39733272,PEDIATRIC MACULAR HOLE ASSOCIATED WITH VITREORETINAL TRACTION ON EPIRETINAL LESIONS: A CASE REPORT AND LITERATURE REVIEW.,"We describe a case of nontraumatic macular hole in a pediatric patient associated with numerous epiretinal lesions throughout the macula.A healthy 9-year-old girl presented to retina clinic with several months of blurry vision in the right eye. Clinically, there was a full-thickness macular hole with serous detachment and white epiretinal tufts. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography confirmed the presence of the full-thickness macular hole with hyperreflective epiretinal proliferations in the right eye and an unremarkable left eye. Systemic workup was negative. After a short period of observation, the patient underwent vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peel and 14% C3F8 gas tamponade in the right eye. Multiple intraoperative samples were sent for further testing, which were also negative.At 1- and 12 months/1 year postoperative visits, examination showed successful closure of the full-thickness macular hole with resolution of the subretinal fluid and improved VA.Nontraumatic macular holes in pediatric patients warrant systemic and ocular workup, including fluorescein angiography and laboratory testing. Good anatomic and visual outcomes are generally seen with spontaneous and surgical closures of macular holes in this age group. Early vitrectomy with histologic analysis of ocular samples should be considered in pediatric macular hole cases associated with vitreoretinal traction, especially those with epiretinal abnormalities.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

39487997,Sex differences in elite track and field performances and inferences about steroid doping.,"Females likely experience larger performance benefits from androgenic-anabolic steroids than males. We set out to determine if there were temporal differences in select athletics (track and field) records between females and males. Exploratory aims included: (1) evaluating the improvements in female and male world records over time, and (2) investigating the influence of doping programs on male and female world records before and after 1990, when sports governing bodies began to implement random out-of-competition and systematic in-competition drug testing. We collected the top 500 performances of all time for both sexes from an online database (worldathletics.org) in four running events (100, 200, 400 and 800 m) and two throwing events (discus throw and shot-put). Data were stratified into quintiles based on world record ranking (1st to 100th, 101st to 200th, etc.). The temporal distribution of the top 100 female performers was significantly earlier than the top 100 male performers (year: 2000 ± 1 vs. 2005 ± 1, respectively; P < 0.0001). Within the event, the top performances occurred significantly earlier for females in the 800 m (year: 1995 ± 15 vs. 2003 ± 12; P = 0.0007) and shot-put (year: 1992 ± 14 vs. 2003 ± 17; P = 0.0004). Among females, world records rapidly improved through the 1980s, but following 1990, the world records ceased to improve. Geographically, there was a greater representation of countries with state-sponsored doping programs, specifically among female performances. We postulate these sex differences in the temporal distribution of top performances are likely associated with enhanced effectiveness of exogenous androgens (steroid doping) among female athletes with lower endogenous androgen hormones compared to males.© 2024 The Author(s).

40315972,Cost-effectiveness of Lynch Syndrome Screening in Colorectal Cancer: Universal Germline vs Sequential Screening.,"Testing all colorectal cancers (CRCs) for mismatch repair status to evaluate for Lynch syndrome (LS) has been recommended for years. Owing to attrition in the multistep diagnostic testing pathway, most qualifying patients still do not receive genetic testing for LS. This leads to missed diagnoses and preventable cancer incidence. To tackle this, we previously reported a systems approach that resulted in a dramatic increase in the identification of patients with LS. We aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this intervention compared with both real-world pre-intervention experience and with upfront germline testing of all CRC probands.We employed data from the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database, the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, and pre-/post-intervention cohort studies to build lifetime Markov cohorts of CRC probands, testing 3 strategies: (1) current standard-of-care; (2) optimized standard-of-care; and (3) upfront germline testing. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in $ per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the United States health system perspective.Strategies #1 to #3 accrued 11.97, 11.98, and 11.99 discounted QALYs at discounted costs of $100,610, $100,980, and $102,290, respectively. The pairwise ICERs on the frontier were $34,500/QALY (95% credible interval [CI], $28,400-$44,200) and $98,500/QALY (95% CI, $73,700-$216,000), respectively. The cost-effectiveness of #3 vs #1 was $70,300/QALY (95% CI, $54,600-$92,500). Current standard-of-care was favored in 0.0% of 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations.Current clinical practice is cost-ineffective. Prospective intervention to dramatically increase LS testing (ie, to reach a threshold of >75%) or, if this level cannot be reached, upfront germline testing are cost-effective interventions that improve quality-adjusted life expectancy.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40322852,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as an Early Underrecognized Feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Population-Based Study of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Occurrence Before and After Rheumatoid Arthritis Incidence.,"We aimed to assess the occurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) before and after rheumatoid arthritis (RA) incidence and by serologic status.This population-based study included residents of a geographically defined area meeting the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for RA in 1980 to 2019 matched 1:1 with individuals without RA. At least two diagnosis codes ≥30 days apart were used to identify CTS. Cumulative incidence of CTS adjusting for competing risk of death was assessed. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used, adjusting for age, sex, calendar year, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism.We included 1,335 patients with RA and 1,331 individuals without RA. The overall prevalence of CTS before or on RA incidence or index was 179 patients with RA (13%) and 85 individuals without RA (6%), respectively (odds ratio [OR] 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-2.94). Most previous incidences of CTS occurred ≥2 years before the index date (112 events in patients with RA and 75 events in individuals without RA, respectively). Following RA incidence or index, individuals with RA (vs those without RA) had ~80%-higher risk of CTS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78; 95% CI 1.38-2.30). The risk estimates of CTS in patients with seronegative (vs seropositive) RA were OR 1.33 (95% CI 0.96-1.84) before RA incidence and HR 1.37 (95% CI 0.99-1.88) after RA incidence. In RA, obesity (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.99) and seronegative cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody status (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.07-2.99), but not other risk factors, were associated with increased CTS risk.We found a more than two-fold increase in risk of CTS in the years preceding RA and a 1.8-fold increased risk of incident CTS following RA onset.© 2025 American College of Rheumatology.",Arthritis care & research,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,George R J|Frechette N|Oviedo M|Javed I|Achenbach S J|Lennon R J|Kimbrough B A|Joerns E K|Kronzer V L|Gingery A|Davis J M|Crowson C S|Myasoedova E,George R J|Frechette N|Oviedo M|Javed I|Achenbach S J|Lennon R J|Kimbrough B A|Joerns E K|Kronzer V L|Gingery A|Davis J M|Crowson C S|Myasoedova E,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","George R J, Frechette N, Oviedo M, Javed I, Achenbach S J, Lennon R J, Kimbrough B A, Joerns E K, Kronzer V L, Gingery A, Davis J M, Crowson C S, Myasoedova E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40322852/,"The key finding of this study is that carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to those without RA.

40488796,Considerations in Care of the Transgender Orthopedic Patient.,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients, those with a gender identity different from their sex assigned at birth, are a growing population with specific orthopedic needs based on the use of gender-affirming hormonal and surgical therapies. This article outlines the current understanding of musculoskeletal basic science, clinical management considerations and translational applications that influence orthopedic care for TGD patients. In addition, this review highlights pertinent United States health policy changes that may affect TGD health outcomes including access to gender-affirming care and athletic participation.TGD patients comprise a small but growing percentage of the population, yet experience significant barriers to health care. Both receipt of gender-affirming care and physical activity have been shown to improve mental health comorbidities in the TGD population. Since 2021, however, a rise in national and state-level policies have restricted healthcare access for TGD patients and their participation in athletic events. Limited collection of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data hinders the generation of population-level clinical evidence for TGD patients within Orthopedics. Despite this, early evidence suggests that estrogen-based and testosterone-based GAHT have a neutral to positive effect on bone health and fracture risk for TGD adults.Further clinical research is needed to define injury patterns in other Orthopedic subspecialties. Despite this, findings extrapolated from basic science and other surgical subspecialties can enable orthopedic providers to engage in evidence-based shared clinical decision-making and patient-centered care.",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Jacobson A R|Goodrich E|Feroe A G|Rahman A,Feroe A G,"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Queens, 4th Floor 56-45 Main St, Flushing, NY, 11355, USA. ayr9010@nyp.org.","Jacobson A R, Goodrich E, Feroe A G, Rahman A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488796/,"This research examines the unique orthopedic needs of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients, who are a growing population.

40398583,Influence of Robotic Versus Manual Technology for Achieving Sagittal Targets in Total Knee Arthroplasty Using a Cruciate-Retaining and Medial-Stabilized Implant.,"Most of the focus regarding total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implant positioning and alignment has been centered on the coronal plane. Posterior condylar offset (PCO) and tibial slope (TS) are sagittal parameters that are measured on radiographs, managed intraoperatively, and are crucial to a stable TKA. We sought to compare whether robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA) versus manual TKA (mTKA) are different with regard to achieving a surgeon's preoperative sagittal targets.We trained a deep learning model based on a U-Net architecture that calculates PCO and TS on lateral knee radiographs. We deployed this model on a consecutive cohort of 280 patients who underwent either mTKA (n = 132) or raTKA (n = 148), with the same medial stabilized knee implant at a tertiary referral center. Measured resection was the technique for mTKA and either calipered kinematic alignment or gap balancing for raTKA.Mean absolute error between the algorithm and human measurements was 1.3 ± 1.6° for TS and 1.7 ± 1.4 mm for PCO, which was less than the difference between the human annotators (2.0 ± 1.9° and 2.2 ± 2.6 mm, respectively). Mean difference between goal and postoperative TS was less in raTKA than mTKA (0.3 versus 1.3°; P = 0.03). However, the opposite was observed regarding restoration of native PCO, favoring mTKA (-1.7 versus 3.3 mm; P < 0.001). Overall, despite increased diversity in alignment philosophies and proportion of cementless fixation, there was less variability in raTKA postoperative data, suggesting increased precision.We developed a deep learning algorithm to calculate PCO and TS on lateral knee radiographs. We observed significant differences between raTKA and mTKA in achieving sagittal plane targets, with raTKA being more precise than mTKA. Future studies are warranted to determine whether these differences are clinically relevant.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40484059,Ten-year experience using cryopreserved arterial allografts for vascular reconstruction during major oncologic surgery.,"Resection of vessel-encasing tumors has been historically associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, advances in surgical techniques and cancer treatments have improved outcomes for patients undergoing resection with vascular reconstruction. In specialized centers, cryopreserved arterial allografts (CAAs) are increasingly used when autologous conduits are unavailable, offering superior anatomical compliance and resistance to infection compared with prosthetic conduits. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of CAAs as a conduit for vascular reconstruction during major oncologic surgery.A retrospective review was conducted on patients without suitable autologous conduits who underwent tumor-related vascular reconstruction with CAAs between January 2014 and May 2024. Outcomes evaluated included conduit patency, freedom from CAA-related reintervention, CAA-related complications, and overall survival.A total of 44 patients (mean age, 57 ± 14 years; 61% female) underwent vascular reconstruction using commercially available femoral and aortoiliac CAAs during resection of abdominopelvic, peripheral, and neck tumors. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was the most common tumor type (73%; n = 32). Single-vessel reconstruction was required in 27% of patients (n = 12), whereas multivessel reconstruction was required in 73% (n = 32). Ninety-three vessels were reconstructed, with a technical success rate of 100%. At 24 months, primary patency was 65% and 46% (P = .19), primary-assisted patency was 75% and 68% (P = .73), and secondary patency was 80% and 78% (P = .95) for arterial and venous reconstructions, respectively. Freedom from CAA-related reintervention was 60%. Hemodynamically significant stenosis (>50% luminal narrowing) was observed in 57% (n = 25) of patients; of these, 23% (n = 10) progressed to occlusion. An additional 11% (n = 5) experienced occlusion without prior stenosis. Structural CAA defects included pseudoaneurysm in 16% (n = 7) of patients, all after pancreatic resection. Fistula formation occurred in 4% (n = 2) and anastomotic dehiscence in 2% (n = 1) of patients. The 36-month survival rate was 50% for patients with non-pancreatic tumors and 23% for those with pancreatic tumors.CAAs are a technically feasible alternative for tumor-related vascular reconstruction, offering acceptable patency rates and freedom from reintervention. They provide a valuable conduit option in clean-contaminated fields and when autologous conduits are unavailable. However, the risk of pseudoaneurysm mandates diligent surveillance in specific settings.Copyright © 2025 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40473005,Long-term comparison of physician-modified endografts with and without low-profile fabric designs for repair of complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.,"After commercial approval, our institution began using the Cook Zenith Alpha low-profile stent graft (LPSG) for physician-modified endograft (PMEG) repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) owing to its smaller sheath size and wider apex-to-apex stent distances, allowing for better accommodation of modifications. We aimed to compare outcomes of PMEGs using LPSGs and the standard-profile stent graft (SPSG), Zenith TX2.We reviewed clinical data and outcomes of patients treated using PMEGs for CAAAs (short-neck infrarenal, juxtarenal, and pararenal AAAs) and TAAAs between 2007 and 2024. End points included 30-day mortality and major adverse events, patient survival, freedom from reintervention, freedom from target artery instability, and freedom from type III endoleak.Of 317 patients treated with PMEGs, 228 (72%) were men with a mean age of 74 ± 9 years. SPSGs were used in 174 patients (55%) and LPSGs were used in 143 patients (45%). Patients treated with LPSGs were mostly treated for TAAAs (69% vs 48%) and subsequently had more incorporated TAs per patient (3.7 ± 0.6 vs 3.1 ± 1.0) compared with the SPSG cohort (P ≤ .001). LPSGs were used more frequently with percutaneous femoral access (91% vs 36%; P ≤ .001) and less frequently with upper extremity access (41% vs 75%; P ≤ .001) and iliofemoral conduits (6% vs 21%; P ≤ .001). Technical success rates were similar between the two groups (89% LPSG vs 93% SPSG; P ≤ .001), with shorter operating time (257 ± 89 minutes vs 296 ± 107 minutes), and lower estimated blood loss (383 ± 464 mL vs 1063 ± 1221 mL) compared with the SPSG cohort (P ≤ .001). Early (30-day) mortality (5% SPSG vs 4% LPSG) and any major adverse events (30 SPSG vs 23 LPSG) were similar between two groups; however, patients in the SPSG cohort were more likely to undergo early aortic or side-branch-related reintervention (13% vs 6%; P ≤ .035). There were no significant differences in 4-year overall survival, freedom from target artery instability, freedom from reintervention, or freedom from type III endoleak rates between the two groups.Repair of CAAAs and TAAAs with PMEGs using devices with low-profile fabric has similar perioperative and long-term outcomes compared with standard-profile endografts, including no difference in endoleak or issues with device integrity. Confounding factors in this comparison include learning curve, improved surveillance, and treatment of more complex aneurysms.Copyright © 2025.

40470836,Does Pelvic Angioembolization Increase Pelvic Ischemic Complications? A Multicenter American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Study.,"Controversy exists about whether pelvic angioembolization (PAE) causes ischemic complications of the pelvis and whether selective vs nonselective embolization influences the risk of these complications.We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study of adult blunt trauma patients with pelvic fractures who underwent angiography for 55 months. Patients who underwent angiography were divided into 4 groups: no embolization (No-Embo), selective embolization (Sel), unilateral nonselective embolization (Non-Sel), and bilateral Non-Sel embolization (B-Non-Sel). The primary outcome was ischemic complications, defined as gluteal skin and muscle necrosis, pelvic abscess, pelvic wound infection, pelvic wound breakdown, and osteomyelitis of the pelvis or femoral head.Of the 460 patients undergoing angiography, pelvic ischemic complications occurred in 45 patients (9.8%). Of these 45 patients, 4 were in the No-Embo group (5.1%), 24 (10.0%) in the Sel group, 11 (15.1%) in the Non-Sel group, and 6 (8.8%) in the B-Non-Sel. There was no significant difference when comparing the groups on univariate analysis (p = 0.23), multivariable analysis (Sel odds ratio [OR] = 2.16, p = 0.3; Non-Sel OR = 4.17, p = 0.07; B-Non-Sel OR = 1.00, p = 0.99) nor when comparing each complication individually.The current study is the largest to date of blunt pelvic fracture patients undergoing angiography. On comparing those not embolized with those selectively and nonselectively embolized, we found no association between pelvic angioembolization and pelvic ischemic complications. The decision of when and where to embolize should be individualized to the injury encountered and the stability of the patient.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

40467383,Phase I/II Study of Subasumstat (TAK-981) in Combination With Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"Subasumstat (TAK-981) is an investigational, first-in-class, innate immunity enhancer that unlocks innate/adaptive immune responses in target tumor microenvironments through SUMOylation inhibition. Subasumstat enhanced antitumor activity of rituximab in preclinical xenograft models.This phase I/II study enrolled 34 patients (n = 31, phase I; n = 3, phase II) with CD20+-positive relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); patients with indolent NHL had to be refractory to an anti-CD20 antibody. In phase I, patients received intravenous subasumstat (10-120 mg) once weekly (QW) (or twice weekly [BIW], 90 mg only) with intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2.No dose-limiting toxicities were reported, no maximum tolerated dose was identified up to 120 mg QW. Safety outcomes were comparable across QW dosing cohorts; grade ≥ 3 and serious adverse events (AEs) were more common in the BIW cohort. The most common AEs reported during dose escalation were pyrexia (55%), chills (39%), and fatigue (35%). Most AEs were transient and consistent with low-grade flu-like symptoms, indicative of interferon pathway activation. Overall, 8/29 evaluable patients receiving QW dosing achieved an objective response (2 complete responses; 6 partial responses); the overall best response rate was 27.6%. Pharmacodynamic analyses provided evidence of dose-dependent target engagement (subasumstat-SUMO adduct and SUMOylation pathway inhibition) in blood and skin. Induction of a type-I interferon response, demonstrated by gene expression analysis, increased plasma cytokines/chemokine levels, and activation of innate and adaptative immune response was also observed.This study demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile of subasumstat combined with rituximab in NHL.Copyright © 2025.

40447486,Incidence of cognitive errors in difficult airway management: an inference human factors study from the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Registry.,"Cognitive errors are known contributors to poor decision-making in healthcare. However, their incidence and extent of their contribution to negative outcomes during difficult airway management are unknown. We aimed to identify cognitive errors during paediatric difficult airway management using data from the Pediatric Difficult Intubation (PeDI) registry, to determine patient and clinician factors associated with these errors, and their contribution to complications.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the PeDI registry data including cases with at least three intubation attempts. Cognitive error definitions were adapted to airway management, and predefined clinical endpoints were used to identify cognitive errors. A subanalysis was performed for children weighing <5 kg. Our primary outcome was the overall incidence of cognitive errors. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of specific cognitive error subtypes, associations with patient and clinician factors, and the relationship between cognitive errors and complications.Cognitive errors were identified in 17.4% (487/2801) of cases, with fixation errors being the most common (11.5%), followed by omission bias (5.9%) and overconfidence bias (4.5%). Non-anaesthesiologist clinicians had the highest odds of cognitive errors. The presence of at least one cognitive error was independently associated with a higher risk of complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.86 [95% confidence interval, 1.53-2.27]; P<0.001), and multiple errors increased the likelihood of severe complications (adjusted odds ratio, 2.48 [95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.94]; P=0.01).Cognitive errors occurred in nearly 20% of paediatric difficult airway encounters and were linked to increased complications.

40444989,Machine Learning-Based Rupture Risk Prediction for Intracranial Aneurysms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Aneurysm risk prediction remains an imprecise science that places patients at risk for either over or undertreatment. Machine learning (ML) models may improve clinical practice by adding precision to risk assessment. This study aims to comprehensively assess the current landscape of ML applications in predicting the risk of aneurysm rupture and compare the performance with the widely used PHASES score.A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. All studies using ML tools to predict the rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms were included. Meta-analysis was conducted with consideration to the ML algorithms and compared with the PHASES score.Thirty-six studies involving 22 462 patients were included in the final analysis. ML techniques, including 124 models using 25 algorithms, were employed. Among various ML models, while they had comparable diagnostic performance, deep learning exhibited a slightly better performance profile (sensitivity = 0.792, specificity = 0.788, and accuracy = 0.778 in external validation). Based on our analysis, ML, regardless of the algorithm, provides comparable sensitivity (0.743 vs 0.771, P = .60) and higher specificity (0.763 vs 0.507, P < .01) compared with the PHASES score. Consistently, pooling the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 60 ML models and 5 PHASES score data, ML models exhibited higher AUC (0.84 vs 0.64, P < .01). Using hemodynamic parameters as input for models improved specificity ( P < .01) in the test sets without any significant changes in the sensitivity. The later improvement was not observed in the external validation sets.ML techniques have the potential to enhance the prediction of intracranial aneurysm rupture compared with traditional approaches, like the PHASES score. Incorporating hemodynamic parameters may further enhance the accuracy of ML models. Feature prospective studies are required to validate the utility of ML models for clinical integration.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

40408224,Progression trajectories of chronic overlapping pain conditions unveiled across two large clinical data warehouses.,"Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) affect a wide population and incur a substantial disease burden including comorbid mental disorders. Although these comorbidities have been extensively documented, the longitudinal trajectories of their onset, particularly for those with three or more conditions, have been rarely studied. We conducted retrospective cohort studies to identify statistically significant COPCs and mental health trajectories in the All of Us Research Program (AoU v8, 338,170 persons) and the Mayo Data Warehouse (3,957,444 individuals). For each trajectory, cases were matched with controls by demographic factors. Logistic regression was then applied to assess the increased likelihood of the final condition given the prior conditions in that sequence. The significant trajectories were visualized as a ""pain forest."" More than 88% of trajectories identified from AoU (Male: 78, Female: 361) were reproducible in the Mayo Data Warehouse data (Male: 361, Female: 1286), with female trajectories encompassing more than 96% of the male trajectories. The findings indicate that chronic low back pain generally occurs earlier than other conditions, while fibromyalgia tends to follow other COPCs. Endometriosis seems to be associated with an increased prevalence of COPCs in women. In addition, longer trajectories are associated with a greater risk of developing additional COPC or mental condition. The results offer new insights into the progression of COPCs and associated mental conditions, which may inform healthcare providers and patients in managing and preventing exacerbation of these conditions.Copyright © 2025 International Association for the Study of Pain.",Pain,"Nov 01, 2025",2025,Nov,01,Li H|Fan J W|Baldwin E|Luo W|Zhou J|Hooten W M,Fan J W|Hooten W M,"Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.|Department of Artificial Intelligence & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Statistics & Data Science Graduate Interdisciplinary Program, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.|Department of Biostatistics, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States.|Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology.

40398577,Long-Term Risk of Heart Failure in Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"Previous case reports raised concerns about the cardiovascular effects of metal particles and ions produced by mechanical wear and corrosion of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) implants. We compared the long-term risk of heart failure in a cohort of individuals who had TJA and in a general population comparison cohort.This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 7,182 TJA subjects who first had total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty surgeries between 1990 and 2020 and 7,407 age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched non-TJA subjects. All subjects were followed up until death, incident heart failure, migration, or 2020. The medical records were reviewed to collect data on surgical history, cardiovascular risk factors, and heart failure outcomes. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the risk of heart failure in TJA subjects, accounting for the competing risk of death and adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.At baseline, TJA subjects had a higher prevalence of several cardiovascular risk factors than the non-TJA subjects. The risk of heart failure in TJA subjects was similar to the general population during the first decade after surgery. However, the risk increased over time, and by the second decade after surgery, the risk of heart failure in both the THA (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 to 1.58) and total knee arthroplasty (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.53) subjects was higher than the non-TJA subjects. The long-term risk of heart failure was higher among THA subjects with cobalt-chromium-containing implants and those who underwent surgery for fractures and inflammatory arthritis.We observed a higher risk of heart failure beyond the first decade after TJA surgery. However, the magnitude of the risk is small and should be interpreted with caution due to the possibility of informative presence and confounding bias.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40324694,New platinum derivatives selectively cause double-strand DNA breaks and death in naïve and cisplatin-resistant cholangiocarcinomas.,"Patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have poor prognosis. Current cisplatin-based first-line chemotherapy offers limited survival benefit. Cisplatin induces single-strand DNA breaks, activating DNA repair mechanisms that diminish its effectiveness. Here, we present the design, chemical synthesis, and therapeutic evaluation of a new generation of chemotherapeutic agents (Aurkines) with unique polyelectrophilic properties. These agents cause a high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks, bypassing DNA repair, and promoting cancer cell death.Two novel compounds, Aurkine 16 and Aurkine 18, were designed and evaluated for their antitumor effects in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, healthy cholangiocytes, and in vivo models.Aurkines effectively induced double-strand DNA breaks, leading to increased DNA damage and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin in CCA cells. Phosphoproteomic and molecular analysis revealed that cisplatin activates DNA repair pathways, while Aurkines primarily induce apoptosis. Importantly, Aurkines also triggered apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant CCA cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts without harming healthy cholangiocytes. Additionally, Aurkines demonstrated cytotoxicity in other cisplatin-resistant cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. This tumor selectivity results from reduced uptake, increased efflux, and compact chromatin structure in normal cells, limiting Aurkine-DNA interactions. In vivo, Aurkines inhibited the growth of subcutaneous naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA tumors, as well as orthotopic tumors in immunocompetent mice, promoting antitumor immune cell recruitment without any adverse events. Transport studies revealed that Aurkines were selectively taken up by OCT1, OCT3, CTR1, and OATP1A2, whereas only CTR1 transported cisplatin.Aurkines represent promising therapeutic drugs for both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancers due to their unique polyelectrophilic properties and selective targeting of malignant cells.This study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy designed to induce frequent double-strand DNA breaks selectively in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, without evident toxic side effects at therapeutic doses.

40388528,Are There Differences in 2-Year Outcomes Between Two-Level Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion Versus Single-Level Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion to Treat Cervical Myelopathy? A Quality Outcomes Database Study.,"There has been limited assessment between anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. We sought to compare PROMs from two-level ACDF with single-level ACCF procedures. We evaluate these results in the context of minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds, which have not been performed previously.This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Quality Outcomes Database Spine Collaborative Research Study Group compared two-level ACDF and single-level ACCF at 3-, 12-, and 24 months postoperatively. PROMs included arm pain Numeric Rating Scale, neck pain Numeric Rating Scale, Neck Disability Index, and North American Spine Society Patient Satisfaction Index. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine differences in perioperative outcomes, as well as the impact of two-level ACDF vs one-level ACCF on PROMs. MCID thresholds were based off previously established limits.Three hundred and thirty patients were included (236 ACDF, 94 ACCF), and the follow-up rate was 82% at 2 years. There was a significantly higher baseline age, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, proportion of diabetes, osteoarthritis, ambulation dependence, and myelopathy severity in the ACCF cohort. On multivariable analysis, the ACCF group had greater average length of stay and estimated blood loss. There were no significant differences between reoperation rates or nonroutine discharge. There were similar rates of MCID achievement for PROMs at all time points.This study suggests that both ACDF and ACCF procedures for cervical spondylotic myelopathy are able to achieve similar, clinically meaningful improvements in PROMs by 2 years. Patients undergoing single-level ACCF have more estimated blood loss and longer length of stay, as well as worse baseline myelopathy. Both procedures have efficacious, durable outcomes. It is reasonable that other factors, such as radiographic characteristics and patient symptoms, may influence patient selection for ACDF vs ACCF.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

40386907,Hand Swelling and Other Non-Raynaud Phenomenon Symptoms as the Initial Presentation of Systemic Sclerosis: Prevalence and Clinical Associations in Two US Cohorts.,"Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is often the initial clinical manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc), but some patients develop other manifestations first. To help elucidate the diversity of SSc presentation in its early stages, we describe the initial clinical manifestations and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiles of patients in two early SSc cohorts.All patient data in the Genetics vs Environment in Scleroderma Outcomes Study (GENISOS) and Collaborative National Quality and Efficacy Registry (CONQUER) cohorts were reviewed. Both studies enrolled patients within five years of the first non-RP symptom.In GENISOS and CONQUER, respectively, 194 (44.2%) of 439 and 292 (31.1%) of 938 patients had a non-RP initial symptom, most commonly puffy fingers/hands. Black patients had a non-RP symptom before RP more commonly than patients in other race and ethnicity categories. Non-RP first patients were more likely than RP first patients to have diffuse cutaneous involvement and joint contractures at enrollment and had a higher prevalence of RNA polymerase III antibody positivity.In two large US cohorts, >30% of patients began to manifest SSc with puffy fingers/hands or other symptoms, without the ""warning sign"" of RP as their initial symptom. These patients presented with more severe skin and musculoskeletal disease on average, highlighting the importance of early recognition. The most common autoantibody associated with this presentation was RNA polymerase III. These results should be considered in efforts to recognize SSc in its earliest stages. Puffy fingers/hands, even in the absence of RP, should prompt consideration of early SSc and testing for ANA and SSc-associated autoantibodies, including RNA polymerase III.© 2025 The Author(s).

40383166,Constrained Acetabular Liners Implanted Simultaneously at the Time of Acetabular Revision Using Contemporary Components.,"Concern for early acetabular component loosening may deter surgeons from using a constrained acetabular liner (CAL) at the time of acetabular component revision. We have previously demonstrated this can be safely and effectively done with a highly porous tantalum shell, numerous screws, and a cemented constrained liner. It is not known, however, whether similar outcomes are achievable with contemporary modular acetabular components with a liner-locking mechanism.A retrospective review of our total joint registry from 2000 to 2021 identified 38 cases of revision total hip arthroplasties (THAs) in which a CAL was inserted into a contemporary revision acetabular component placed during the same surgery. All cases received supplemental screw fixation (mean of four screws). The mean age at revision THA was 66 years, 74% of patients were women, and the mean body mass index was 31. The most common indications for index revision THA were recurrent dislocation (57%), aseptic loosening (20%), and two-stage reimplantation (26%). The mean follow-up was 4 years.The 5-year survivorship free from acetabular rerevision for aseptic loosening was 97%, any acetabular rerevision was 94%, and any rerevision was 77%. There was only one acetabular component revised for aseptic loosening at 2 years. There were eight re-revisions performed for dislocation (4), periprosthetic joint infection (2), aseptic loosening (1), and periprosthetic fracture (1). Radiographic review did not identify any evidence of acetabular component loosening in unrevised cases.Selective use of a CAL at the time of acetabular revision with a contemporary acetabular component and multiple screws had a low rate of aseptic loosening. These results suggest that a CAL can be utilized at the time of acetabular revision when a stable acetabular component is inserted with robust screw fixation.Level IV.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40380933,Association Between Social Determinants of Health and Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury in Children: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in the United States (US), with severity and outcomes linked to social determinants of health (SDOH) and regional differences. Data on the impact of SDOH including race, sex, and Child Opportunity Index (COI) level on TBI severity in southeastern US are sparse in children.MethodsWe analyzed data retrospectively in 1063 children with TBI, admitted at a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center in the Southeast US between January 2017-June 2023. TBI severity was categorized using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOHS), intensive care unit stay (LOICUS), and craniotomy frequency. Patients were classified by race (white, Black, non-Black people of color [NBPOC]), COI (low, moderate, high), and sex (male, female). Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc comparisons.ResultsSignificant disparities were observed by race and COI. Black children and children with low COI had lower GCS scores (P < 0.01), longer LOHS and LOICUS (P < 0.01) compared to white children and those with high COI. Additionally, Black and NBPOC children were more likely to undergo craniotomies than white children (P < 0.05). No sex-based differences in TBI severity or outcomes were found.DiscussionThis study highlights the significant impact of SDOH, particularly race and COI, on pediatric TBI severity, surgical interventions, and outcomes.

40378992,Simplifying Diagnosis of Bile Acid Diarrhea With Clinical and Biochemical Measurements on Blood and Single Stool Sample.,"Diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea (BAD) has been based on 48-hour fecal BA excretion; serum 7αC4 (C4) has been used to screen for BAD. Optimal diagnostic cutoffs for C4 and biochemical measurements in a single stool sample are unknown. We sought to examine the relationship between total BA concentration (TBAc) and percent primary BA (%PBA) in a single stool sample and serum C4 in patients with and without BAD and explore performance characteristics of stool consistency and biochemical (serum C4 and single-stool BA) parameters for diagnosis of BAD compared with gold standard 48-hour fecal BA.Based on data from patients with BAD, irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and healthy control subjects, we assessed correlations among stool and serum measurements. Machine learning models (based on data from 30 patients with BAD, 8 patients with IBS-D, and 26 healthy control subjects) were trained on 25 bootstrapped random samples, the superior model was identified, and optimal cutoffs of biological measurements to diagnose BAD were summarized.There were correlations between serum C4 and %PBA (R = 0.284, P < .001), and between %PBA and TBAc (R = 0.49, P < .001). Using a %PBA of 1.05% (25th percentile in BAD), the %PBA distinguished BAD from IBS-D (odds ratio, 3.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-7.46; P = .01). The multivariate logistic regression model had superior balance of variance and bias. Optimal cutoffs for predicting BAD using logistic regression were 4.5% PBA (P = .023) and 1.88 μmol/g TBAc (P = .016). Serum C4 >24 ng/mL and PBA >4.6% individually had 57% and 75.8% positive predictive value, respectively, but together had a 90.1% positive predictive value. Stool consistency was less informative.New diagnostic cutoffs based on serum C4 and single-stool TBAc and % PBA provide potential alternatives for diagnosing BAD.

Methods: Patients from 11 intensive care units (ICUs) across five Mayo Clinic hospitals were included if they met the following criteria: a) ≥ 18 years of age, b) received propofol infusion while on invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥24 h, and c) had a triglyceride level measured. The primary outcome was hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride >400 mg/dL) onset within 10 days of propofol initiation. Both COVID-inclusive and COVID-independent modeling pipelines were developed to ensure applicability post-pandemic. Decision thresholds were chosen to maintain model sensitivity >80%. Nested leave-one-site-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) was used to externally evaluate pipeline performance. Model explainability was assessed using permutation importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results: Among 3922 included patients, 769 (19.6%) developed propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia, and 879 (22.4%) had COVID-19 at ICU admission. During nested LOSO-CV, the COVID-inclusive pipeline achieved an average AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.72), while the COVID-independent pipeline achieved an average AUC-ROC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.70). Age, initial propofol dose, and BMI were the top three most important features in both models.

40369720,The Role of Stromal Tumor Environment in Advancing Skin Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The stromal tumor environment (STE) plays a vital yet often underrecognized role in cancer progression, shaping tumor development. It influences complex interactions among stromal cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and signaling molecules. Stromal cells regulate integrin signaling and are involved in remodeling the tumor microenvironment, driving critical processes such as cell migration, survival, angiogenesis, and proliferation. Advances in understanding the STE are creating new opportunities for early cancer detection and treatment. Innovations in molecular imaging, particularly for melanoma, are transforming cancer diagnostics by providing deeper insights into tumor biology, cellular interactions, and angiogenesis, paving the way for more personalized and timely therapeutic interventions. Among these advancements, in vivo skin fluorescent imaging (SFI) stands out as a powerful tool, offering real-time molecular insights at the point of care with the ability to improve patient management.© 2025 The Author(s).

Paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCBs) are an alternative to uncoated balloons (UCBs) for ISR.We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central for studies comparing PCB with UCB in treating ISR. Outcomes included late lumen loss, binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).Eight trials including 1410 patients [PCB in 865 (61%), follow-up 6 months to 10 years) were identified. Angiographic outcomes of late lumen loss [mean difference: -0.50 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.66 to -0.33; P  < 0.01] and binary restenosis [relative risk (RR): 0.22; 95% CI: 0.13-0.40; P  < 0.01] at 6-8 months were lower with PCB. TLR at 6 months (RR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.40; P  < 0.001) and 1 year (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.31-0.66; P  < 0.001), MACE at 6 months (RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.16-0.38; P  < 0.001), MACE at 3-5 years (RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.37-0.80; P  = 0.002), and TLR at 3-5 years (RR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.90; P  = 0.021) were lower with PCB. Meta-regression revealed that ISR lesions in the left anterior descending artery were associated with lower rates of binary restenosis while the opposite was observed for left circumflex lesions.Revascularization of coronary ISR with PCB is associated with reduced late lumen loss, binary restenosis, TLR, CCE, and MACE.

MSLA was associated with lower rates of mRS 0-2 (OR, 0.32 [95% CI: 0.26-0.41]; p < 0.001), similar rates of TICI 2b-3 (OR, 0.91 [95% CI: 0.77-1.07]; p = 0.235) and sICH (OR, 1.18 [95% CI: 0.92-1.51]; p = 0.202), and greater rates of mortality (OR, 2.89 [95% CI: 2.38-3.52]; p < 0.001) compared to AMLA.MSLA is associated with lower rates of mRS 0-2 and worse safety outcomes following EVT for LVO, despite similar rates of TICI 2b-3. Future prospective studies should further study MSLA as a prognosticator following EVT.Question Does the severity of LA impact functional and safety outcomes following EVT for acute ischemic stroke due to LVO? Findings Moderate-to-severe LA was associated with lower rates of good functional outcome and higher mortality following EVT, despite similar rates of successful reperfusion and sICH. Clinical relevance LA severity is an independent prognostic factor in EVT outcomes. Identifying patients with moderate-to-severe LA can aid in risk stratification and post-procedural management, optimizing individualized stroke treatment and follow-up strategies.© 2025.

40347090,Global research aims for the study of cost and value in health professions education: A Delphi study of international experts.,"Health professions educators constantly make difficult choices about the allocation of finite resources. However, there is limited sound research available to guide their decision-making. The purpose of this study was to address this gap by establishing international consensus on research aims, considering diverse economic and cultural contexts.The authors conducted a three-round Delphi study, engaging an international panel of 73 experts in education research. Panelists were asked to identify (round 1), rank (round 2), and revise (round 3) research aims important for the study of cost and value in medical education. Round 3 results were discussed by an international steering group of nine medical education scientists actively involved in cost and value research, who finalized a list of 20 research aims. Steering group narratives were analyzed to identify additional conceptual insights.From 597 research aims suggested in round 1, 20 research aims were identified after steering group discussion. These were clustered into three categories: (1) funding mechanisms for medical education (e.g. financial policies, cost-effectiveness, and equity impacts); (2) cost and outcomes, e.g. how costs in health professions education relate to concrete outcomes; and (3) economic evaluation of teaching, assessment, and training approaches; e.g. designing and applying formal economic evaluation methods. Steering group discussions noted the limited integration of economic theories into medical education research and the need for foundational studies beyond immediate, practical priorities. They further noted lack of consensus on definitions of cost and value, and appropriate methodologies; underutilization of accepted health economics approaches; and infrequent interdisciplinary collaborations. These collectively act as barriers to advancing the field.The field of cost and value in health professions education remains theoretically and empirically underdeveloped.

41056497,Performance of the multi-target hepatocellular carcinoma blood test: Design and rationale of the ALTUS study.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. HCC screening among patients at elevated risk is associated with improved early detection and overall survival, but current ultrasound-based screening strategies are challenged by low adherence and suboptimal sensitivity. Blood-based screening tests have the potential to enhance adherence and improve early-stage HCC detection if they can demonstrate favorable performance compared with ultrasound-based screening. Here we present the design and rationale for ALTUS (Alternative to Ultrasound), a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study in the United States to investigate the performance of the multi-target HCC blood test (mt-HBT) for the detection of HCC in a screening population.Adults with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B infection will be enrolled to undergo standard-of-care screening imaging and concurrent blood collection for the mt-HBT. All participants will undergo contrast-enhanced CT or MRI imaging with central radiology LI-RADS assessment as the reference method to determine HCC status. Participants without an identified malignancy will undergo a second screening visit and blood collection, and longitudinal clinical and imaging data will be collected up to 18 months from enrollment. The primary study objectives are to demonstrate that the mt-HBT is non-inferior to ultrasound for early-stage HCC sensitivity and to assess mt-HBT HCC specificity. The secondary objective is to assess mt-HBT overall sensitivity.ALTUS is in progress with readout of the primary analysis expected in 2025.This prospective head-to-head comparison of the mt-HBT versus ultrasound will provide novel data regarding the performance and utility of the mt-HBT for HCC screening.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41085306,Transfusion of Amustaline/Glutathione Pathogen-reduced Red Blood Cells in Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trial.,"Transfusion has a persistent low risk of transfusion-transmitted infection and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease that may be addressed using pathogen reduction. The Red Cell Pathogen Inactivation (ReCePI) trial tested whether amustaline/glutathione pathogen-reduced red cells are noninferior to conventional transfusions for support of acute surgical blood loss.A phase 3, double-blinded, noninferiority trial randomized cardiac or thoracic-aorta surgery patients with increased risk of red cell transfusion to receive pathogen-reduced or conventional red cells during and for 7 days postsurgery. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), which is defined as an increase from baseline of greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl serum creatinine within 48 h of surgery. Noninferiority was claimed if the upper bound 95% CI of the treatment difference was less than half (50%) of the observed conventional arm incidence. Adverse events and treatment-emergent red cell antibodies were assessed for 28 and 75 days, respectively.A total of 581 subjects were randomized, and 321 (55%) were transfused with study red cells. Transfused subjects in both arms had similar baseline demographics, medical histories, hemoglobin levels, and surgical procedures. Hemoglobin day 3 nadir levels (8.6 g/dl [7.8 to 9.2] in the pathogen-reduced arm; 8.4 g/dl [7.8 to 9.3] in the conventional arm; P = 0.52) were comparable. Incidence of AKI by 48 h was 46 of 157 (29.3%) in the pathogen-reduced arm and 45 of 161 (28.0%) in the conventional arm (treatment difference, 0.7%; 95% CI, -8.9 to 10.4%; noninferiority margin, 14.0%; P = 0.001 for noninferiority). AKI within 7 days by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging criteria was not different (59 of 159 [37.1%] in the pathogen-reduced arm; 55 of 162 [34.0%] in the conventional arm; P = 0.53), but stage III was more common in the pathogen-reduced arm (pathogen-reduced arm, 15 of 159 [9.4%]; conventional arm, 7 of 162 [4.3%]; P = 0.075). Of 159 pathogen-reduced red cell recipients, 5 (3.1%) developed specific, low-titer antibodies without evidence of hemolysis.The incidence of AKI in recipients of pathogen-reduced red cells was noninferior to conventional red cell transfusion. Treatment-emergent antibodies were uncommon and not clinically significant.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41084512,Global but not myeloid lineage-directed Girk3 deletion increases bone mass in female mice.,"Germline and osteoblast-directed deletion of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel 3 (Girk3) was recently shown to increase bone mass after 18 wk of age in male mice. Here, we show that germline Girk3 deletion also increases trabecular and cortical bone mass and increases the mechanical strength of the femur in female mice after 18 wk of age. Unlike male mice, however, osteoblast-directed Girk3 deletion using 2.3 kb-Col1a1-Cre does not increase bone mass in adult female mice. To discover mechanisms underlying high bone mass in female Girk3-/- mice, bulk RNA-sequencing was performed on 2-d-old calvarial bone, revealing lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 in Girk3-/- mice. Accordingly, cytokines and chemokines are largely suppressed in the circulation of adult Girk3-/- mice compared to WT littermates. The cytokines GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-9 are reduced in the serum of both male and female Girk3-/- mice, while eotaxin, IFNγ, MIP-1α, and others are sexually dimorphic. Histomorphometry reveals that osteoclast activity is modestly reduced in Girk3-/- bone, which is supported by in vitro osteoclast resorption assays. However, deletion of Girk3 in myeloid-lineage cells with LysM-Cre is not sufficient to recapitulate high bone mass in either male or female mice. Moreover, female Girk3-/- mice are not protected from ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Finally, single-cell screening using cytometry by time-of-flight in the BM revealed no differences in immune cell abundances due to global Girk3 deletion. Taken together, while Girk3 regulates inflammatory cytokine expression in the bone and serum, deletion of Girk3 in myeloid-lineage cells does not affect bone mass.© The Author(s) 2025.

We performed analyses and comparisons of 4 eGFR formulae and 2 mGFR methods in terms of performance, eligibility criteria according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines/age-adjusted criteria, eligibility reclassification, and subgroup analyses.The CKD-EPI 2021 resulted in a higher percentage of patients being eligible for KD (81.4%) and achieved the highest P10 (32%-34%) and P30 (87%-88%) across all mGFR methods. When patients were deemed eligible for donation by any eGFR formula, 95% retained this status on reassessment with mGFR. Conversely, when an eGFR formula classified a patient as ineligible, this was revised to be eligible in about 90% of cases on reassessment with mGFR, with a higher reclassification rate observed when the IoCl was used instead of CrCl.The CKD-EPI 2021 performs best for screening potential KD. If a KD is deemed ineligible by CKD-EPI 2021, there is a high likelihood that they will be reclassified as eligible when assessed with mGFR. This study strongly supports using mGFR in donor evaluations, especially when the eGFR does not meet the criteria to ensure equity of access to being a living donor.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41066835,"No anti-IgLON5 antibody in carefully diagnosed PSP patients with ""atypical"" or variant clinical features.","""Atypical"" features including REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) symptoms and visual hallucinations, and non-Richardson's syndrome (non-RS) variants, are increasingly recognized in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). A concern in clinical practice is missing PSP mimics, like anti-IgLON5 disease, an autoimmune encephalitis which can reportedly present with ""PSP-like"" features and is amenable to immunotherapy. We aimed to determine if anti-IgLON5 antibody is detectable in Movement Disorder Society criteria-diagnosed PSP patients exhibiting ""atypical"" features and variant phenotypes.This was a cross-sectional study of 64 multi-ethnic Asian PSP patients who were recruited via convenience sampling from June 2023-April 2025. Patients were extensively phenotyped by movement disorder neurologists, and their sera tested for immunoglobulin G against IgLON5, using cell-based assays at a neuroimmunology reference laboratory.37.5 % of the cohort had a non-RS phenotype, and 39.1 % had RBD symptoms and/or non-predominant visual hallucinations. Additionally, when the presence of other features that could be associated with a higher likelihood of anti-IgLON5 disease were also accounted for (i.e., comorbid autoimmune disease, orofacial dyskinesia, protracted disease duration, and/or lack of downgaze-predominant oculomotor abnormalities), these patients comprised 95.3 % of the cohort. Despite this, none tested positive for anti-IgLON5 antibody.Our results suggest that routine testing for anti-IgLON5 antibody in patients carefully diagnosed with PSP in movement disorder clinics is likely to be of very low yield. However, testing in research settings of larger cohorts of atypical and variant PSP presentations, applying consensus diagnostic criteria and detailed phenotypic characterization, may currently still be of value.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41059603,Pilot Study Assessing the Efficacy of Melatonin and Osteogenic Loading on Bone Health in a Postmenopausal Population with Osteopenia: MelaOstrong Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The purpose of this 1-year study was to assess the effect of osteogenic loading combined with melatonin on musculoskeletal health and well-being in a population with osteopenia. Participants were randomized into one of four groups and received mock loading plus plant fiber as placebo (ML/Placebo), mock loading plus 5 mg melatonin (ML/Melatonin), osteogenic loading plus placebo (OL/Placebo), and osteogenic loading plus 5 mg melatonin (OL/Melatonin). The loading protocol was designed to deliver multiples of body weight (MOB; 1-2 MOB for mock loading and 1.5-4.2 MOB for osteogenic loading) to the upper body (targeting the arm, chest, and shoulders), core (targeting the spine and core stability), lower body (targeting the legs and hip) and postural (targeting the spine and posture). Following these interventions, musculoskeletal health was measured by DXA and functional testing using timed-up-and-go (TUG) and sit-to-stand (STS) assessments. Markers of bone health (e.g., P1NP, CTX, CRP, cortisol, and melatonin) were assessed in urine collected during the night (10 pm-6 am). Mental health assessments were conducted using PSS, CES-D, STAI and QualiOst. Time-dependent increases in the amount of force exerted (in lbs) were observed in the OL groups for all musculoskeletal systems targeted, compared to those participants receiving ML. Over 12mos, compared to baseline, participants in the OL/Melatonin group had statistically significant increases in lumbar spine T-scores (mean difference [MD] = 0.13, standard deviation [SD] = 0.05, p = 0.015) and BMD (MD = 0.013, SD = 0.006, p = 0.021). No other statistically significant effects were noted for T-scores, BMD, or FRAX scores. Additionally, no significant differences were observed when T-scores were compared between groups. Functional assessments at 12mos revealed increases in TUG times (MD = -1.7, SD = 0.3, p = 0.002) from baseline and deterioration for STS (MD = 2.8, SD = 0.59, p = 0.004) from month 03 for ML/placebo group, which did not occur for the other interventions. Correlation analysis revealed negative associations between TUG performance and CTX levels starting at 3mos in the OL/Melatonin group (r = -0.960, p = 0.04). The change in STS repetitions over a 12-month period (12mo-0mo) was negatively associated with the P1NP:CTX ratio (r = -0.978, p = 0.02) and positively associated with melatonin levels in the OL/Melatonin group (r = 0.958, p = 0.04). No changes in nocturnal output of CRP or cortisol and subject-reported outcomes were observed for any of the interventions within and between groups. The results from this study reveal that osteogenic loading combined with melatonin may be an alternative therapeutic intervention for those with osteopenia.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

41057230,Adaptation and Performance of the Self-Report-Generated Charlson Comorbidity Index in the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Cohort.,"Newly diagnosed patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) often have a history of other diseases, and these comorbidities can impact patient treatment and management options, as well as overall survival (OS). We developed the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) comorbidity index (LCI) as a sum of 10 comorbidities adapted from the Self-Report-Generated Charlson Comorbidity Index (SRG-CCI) for use in the LEO cohort, a national prospective study of newly diagnosed NHL. Of the 5502 participants with self-reported comorbidity data, 3107 (56.4%) were male and the mean age at diagnosis was 60.9 years (range, 18-99 years). The LCI ranged from 0 to 6, with 48.6% having 0, 30.2% having 1, 21.2% having 2 or more comorbidities. With a median follow-up of 62.4 months among surviving participants, 2099 patients had an event and 1219 died. Continuous LCI similarly predicted both 1-year mortality (c-statistic = 0.654) and OS (c-statistic = 0.655), while it showed a weaker but still statistically significant predictive ability for lymphoma-specific (c-statistics = 0.617) and event-free (c-statistic = 0.574) survival. Participants with 1 (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.39) and 2+ (HR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.56-2.08) comorbidities had inferior OS compared to those with no comorbidities after adjustment for age and sex (c-statistic = 0.654), and performance strengthened after adjustment for the International Prognostic Index (c-statistic = 0.672). LCI predicted OS most strongly in marginal zone (c-statistics = 0.748) and weakest in T-cell (c-statistic = 0.579) lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of death due to lymphoma, lymphoma treatment, and other causes all increased with increasing comorbidities, with the greatest increase observed for death due to other causes. The LCI performs comparable to other published comorbidity indices, supporting its use in the LEO cohort to better model real-world outcomes and more generally providing an approach to implementing comorbidity indices in cancer survivorship cohorts.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Hematological oncology,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Cerhan J R|Sokolova T|Cahn E J|Tsang M|Strouse C S|Hildebrandt M A T|Rosenthal A C|Feldman A L|Jaye D L|Martin P|Cohen J B|Kahl B S|Lossos I S|Friedberg J W|Nastoupil L J|Link B K|Habermann T M|Maurer M J|Casulo C|Thompson C A|Williams A M|Flowers C R,Cerhan J R|Sokolova T|Cahn E J|Tsang M|Rosenthal A C|Feldman A L|Friedberg J W|Habermann T M|Maurer M J|Casulo C|Thompson C A|Williams A M,"Division of Epidemiology, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.|Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.|Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.|Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.|Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.|Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.|Southwest Oncology, CommonSpirit Mercy, Durango, Colorado, USA.|Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Cerhan J R, Sokolova T, Cahn E J, Tsang M, Strouse C S, Hildebrandt M A T, Rosenthal A C, Feldman A L, Jaye D L, Martin P, Cohen J B, Kahl B S, Lossos I S, Friedberg J W, Nastoupil L J, Flowers C R, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41057230/,"The study developed a comorbidity index, called the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) comorbidity index (LCI), to predict overall survival in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

41052499,Long-term seizure outcome in pediatric and adolescent patients receiving curative and palliative frontal lobe epilepsy surgery.,"Resective or ablative frontal lobe surgery is an established treatment for drug-resistant frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) in pediatric and adolescent patients, typically performed with curative intent. Emerging evidence suggests potential benefit even when used with palliative intent, though long-term outcome data based on surgical intent remains limited.We retrospectively reviewed patients aged <19 years with drug-resistant FLE who underwent resective/ablative surgery at a single academic epilepsy surgery center (2008-2024). Patients with prior epilepsy surgery, multilobar surgery, <1 year of follow-up, or lack of research authorization were excluded. Seizure outcomes, recurrence patterns, and predictive factors were analyzed using survival analysis and Cox regression. Recurrence was classified as early (1 week to 2 years) or late (>2 years). Delayed seizure freedom was defined as seizure-free > 1 year before last follow-up after initial recurrence.Of the 25 patients included, 8 were female, 19 White, and 3 Hispanic/Latino. Median follow-up was 74 months (IQR 25.5-155). Median age at surgery was 10.58 years (IQR 3.21-14.5). Surgical intent was curative in 20 patients and palliative in 5 patients. Seizure freedom at last follow-up was achieved in 65 % of curative cases and 20 % of palliative cases. Pre-operative status epilepticus (SE) was the only significant predictor of recurrence in the curative surgery group (p = 0.024). Recurrence occurred in 50 % of curative cases, with early recurrences often drug-resistant. Delayed seizure freedom was achieved in 15 % of curative cases, including two after reoperation. In the palliative group, 80 % achieved ≥50 % seizure reduction.Curative FLE surgeries are effective for long-term seizure control in pediatric and adolescent patients, with pre-operative SE possibly predicting recurrence. Palliative surgeries also yield meaningful seizure reduction, supporting their use in selected patients. Early surgical referral and consideration for reoperation may improve long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

We treated a single patient for 36 months 30 months of age at enrollment, under a single-patient investigational new drug expanded access request, with govorestat (AT-007), a novel, highly selective, once daily, brain penetrant ARI at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg oral suspension, which was escalated to 30 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary assessments included liver transaminases, factor XI, antithrombin III, and whole blood and urine sorbitol. Clinical outcomes were also assessed, including Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale. Govorestat was well tolerated; no adverse effects were noted. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels improved from a pre-treatment 12-month average of 205 and 268 U/L to 63 and 68 U/L, respectively, averaged over 36 months of govorestat treatment at 30 mg/kg. Antithrombin III and factor XI fluctuated with illness throughout the study period but overall increased by 60%-100%, approaching the normal range (> 83% activity) at the 5 mg/kg dose. Whole blood sorbitol decreased in a dose-dependent fashion, normalizing at the 30 mg/kg dose. The NPCRS improved by 9 points (46%) over the course of treatment. In conclusion, our patient tolerated govorestat without safety concerns.

41052400,Outcomes in Patients With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Related Myopathy and Prolonged Follow-Up.,"Myopathy is one of the most common neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) reported after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cancer immunotherapies. Current knowledge on disease course relates to short-term outcomes, and long-term outcome data are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients with ICI-related myopathy.We reviewed Mayo Clinic patients diagnosed with ICI-related myopathy between 2013 and 2024 with at least 6 months of follow-up; we compared them with patients who died because of myopathy within 2 months from disease onset.Twenty-three patients were identified; the median follow-up duration was 13 months (range 6-76). The median age at presentation was 73 years (range 34-87), and 57% were male. The most common presentations were ocular involvement (78%, including oculomotor and ptosis), followed by proximal limb (74%), axial (61%), and bulbar (48%) weakness. Myocarditis was present in 35%. At disease nadir, 43% had an irAE grade >2. All patients were treated with corticosteroids; 61% received additional immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment in the acute setting. The median treatment duration was 5 months (range 1-17). At the last follow-up, 87% of patients had a favorable outcome (irAE grade ≤2), yet residual symptoms/signs were common (48%). Gradual improvement was observed in most patients, even after immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment was discontinued. The only patient with a truly refractory course had biopsy findings of nemaline rods. Compared with patients with long-term follow-up, patients who died within 2 months (N = 9) were more commonly men (57% vs 100%, p = 0.03) and more likely to have bulbar or axial involvement (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively).Approximately half of the patients with ICI-related myopathy and long-term follow-up had some residual symptoms/signs, despite good functional outcomes. Symptoms continue to improve over 12 months regardless of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment duration.

41038040,Subpectoral to prepectoral pocket change in implant-based breast reconstruction: A retrospective cohort study at a single institution.,"Patients who underwent breast reconstruction with submuscular implants frequently experience animation deformity (AD), pain, and cosmetic issues, warranting consideration of implant removal, exchange, pocket change, or autologous reconstruction. Advances in prepectoral reconstruction have prompted several patients to undergo transfer of their implants from a submuscular to prepectoral pocket (""pocket change"").We conducted a single-center, retrospective review analyzing all patients with post-mastectomy submuscular implant-based reconstruction who underwent pocket change procedures from 2014 to 2023.Procedures on 275 breasts in 153 patients met the inclusion criteria. Reasons for pursuing surgery included pain or discomfort (173 procedures, 63%), AD (158, 57%), non-AD cosmetic issues (92, 33%), muscle spasm (84, 31%), capsular contracture (68, 25%), and implant rupture (44, 16%). In 45 cases (16%), the procedure was staged using prepectoral tissue expanders. Mesh was used in 194 procedures (71%). Mean length of postoperative follow-up was 2.54 years. Complications included 7 seromas (2.5%), 1 hematoma (0.4%), 10 infections (3.6%), and 7 hospitalizations within 30 days of surgery (2.5%). In 6 patients (2.2%), the prepectoral implant was removed within 1 year of surgery-due to 5 infections and 1 capsular contracture. Ten cases (3.6%) of capsular contracture were reported. AD was resolved in all affected patients. Finally, 82 patients reported pain outcomes within 60 days of their unilateral or bilateral procedure, with 75 (91%) experiencing resolved or significantly improved pain.A pocket change procedure is an effective intervention to treat complications associated with submuscular implant reconstruction.

41027819,Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement: a narrative review of best practices for perioperative management of patients with bleeding disorders.,"Patients with bleeding disorders comprise a population at elevated risk of adverse events in the perioperative period. Patients might have been previously diagnosed with bleeding disorders or be suspected of having an underlying bleeding disorder. Because of the rarity of these diseases, perioperative management of these patients requires carefully orchestrated multidisciplinary care to prevent adverse outcomes. We present a practical and clinically relevant approach to patients with suspected and known inherited bleeding disorders. For patients with more common bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease (vWD), haemophilias, and factor deficiencies, we detail recommendations for perioperative laboratory evaluation and factor and blood product supplementation. We also provide an overview of the diagnosis and perioperative management of less common conditions such as inherited platelet function disorders and disorders of fibrinogen and fibrinolysis. We discuss best practices with regards to availability of specialist expertise and timely phlebotomy, laboratory, and pharmacy resources. A detailed and individualised plan coupled with close communication amongst the perioperative team will help improve care for patients with bleeding disorders undergoing surgery.Copyright © 2025 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

41021740,Dynamic cholangiocyte responses in a murine model of reversible cholestasis: macrophage remodeling and NF-Y-mediated TGFβ1 expression.,"During cholestasis, cholangiocytes become activated, promoting macrophage-associated periductal infiltration and fibrosis. The cholangiocyte-specific mechanisms responsible for these processes are unclear. To gain insight into the cholangiocyte signaling mechanisms contributing to these pathophysiologic processes, mice were fed a 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-collidine (DDC) diet for 10 days to induce liver injury and then switched to a chow diet to permit recovery, designated as R days. Profiling of isolated intrahepatic leukocytes by mass spectrometry revealed an abundant CX3CR1+ macrophage population on the DDC diet that declined during the recovery period. This observation was confirmed using Cx3cr1GFP mice. Next, cholangiocytes were isolated from control, DDC, and R15 mice, and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed. Cholangiocyte CX3CL1 expression, the cognate ligand for CX3CR1, increased in DDC-fed mice and returned to basal values by R15, implicating cholangiocytes in CX3CR1+ macrophage recruitment. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of the RNAseq data revealed upregulation of the pathogen-induced cytokine storm pathway in cholangiocytes activated from DDC fed mice, and resolution of this pathway in R15 isolated cholangiocytes. SCENIC regulon analysis identified that NF-Y, a transcription factor complex, was activated only on the DDC diet, but not in control or R15 mice. Finally, siRNA targeted suppression of NF-YA in normal human cholangiocytes (NHC) reduced cholangiocyte expression of the profibrogenic ligand TGFβ1. Consistent with this observation, Tgfβ1 was increased in cholangiocytes from DDC-fed animals that returned to control values at day R15. Collectively, these observations provide mechanistic insights into cholangiocyte pathobiology during cholestasis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cholangiocyte pathophysiological activation was examined in a model of murine cholestasis. CX3CR1+ macrophages are recruited to the periportal region, likely mediated by cholangiocyte expression of CX3CL1. Cholangiocyte transcriptomics from cholestatic mice display activation of a ""pathogen-induced cytokine storm"" pathway, and exhibit activation of the transcription factor NF-Y. In human cholangiocytes, NF-Y promotes expression of the profibrogenic ligand TGFβ1. These observations provide insights into the cholestatic cholangiocyte pathobiology contributing to periductal inflammation and fibrosis.",American journal of physiology.

41019029,Efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients with coronary artery disease: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Inflammation is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that can be used to improve clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to August 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported clinical outcomes with the use of colchicine in CAD. Data for outcomes was extracted and summary estimates were generated using a random effects model.16 RCTs were included reporting data for 20,601 patients. The pooled analysis demonstrated a non-significant difference between colchicine and control groups for reducing all-cause death (RR: 0.97; 95 % CI, 0.78-1.22), cardiovascular death (RR: 0.98; 95 % CI, 0.79-1.21), and stroke (RR: 0.67; 95 % CI, 0.39-1.15). However, colchicine significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (RR: 0.74; 95 % CI, 0.59-0.93), and ischemia-driven revascularization (RR = 0.72; 95 % CI, 0.53-0.99) at the expense of an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR = 1.83; 95 % CI, 1.38-2.43) as compared to control.Colchicine does not reduce the relative risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with CAD. However, it can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemia drive revascularization. Additional trial data are required to confirm these findings.© 2025 The Authors.",American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Ahmed M|Hashmi T M|Shafiq A|Ashraf H|Jain H|Khanji M Y|Providência R|Chahal A A|Rana J S|Farhan M|Ahmed R|Fudim M|Fonarow G C,Chahal A A,"Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.|Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.|All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India.|Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.|Cardiovascular Epidemiology & Evidence Synthesis, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.|Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, WellSpan Health, Lancaster, PA, USA.|NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.|Division of Cardiology, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA, USA.|Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA, USA.|National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.|Department of Cardiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK.|Division of Cardiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.|Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, USA.|Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center, Division of Cardiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.","Ahmed M, Hashmi T M, Shafiq A, Ashraf H, Jain H, Khanji M Y, Providência R, Chahal A A, Rana J S, Farhan M, Ahmed R, Fudim M, Fonarow G C",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41019029/,"The key finding of this medical research is that while colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, does not reduce the risk of death in patients with coronary artery disease, it can lower the risk of heart attack and the need for revascularization procedures.

41014103,Multiparametric MRI for Diagnosing Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension and Predicting Liver Decompensation.,"Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥ 10 mmHg) is a severe complication of chronic liver disease, with increased risk of variceal bleeding and liver decompensation (at HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg). This study evaluated the performance of multiparametric (mp)MRI for diagnosing CSPH and predicting liver decompensation, compared to ultrasound-based shear wave elastography (SWE) and blood tests.In this prospective single-centre study (2018-2022), 59 patients (M 30, mean age 52.7 years) underwent mpMRI and HVPG measurement, with an average interval of 32 ± 31 days. The mpMRI protocol included 2D/3D MR elastography (MRE), T1/proprietary iron-compensated T1 (cT1)/T1ρ mapping, gadoxetate-enhanced dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the liver and spleen, SWE and blood tests. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U tests, ROC analysis, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.CSPH was present in 13 patients (22%). Several MRI parameters showed high diagnostic performance for CSPH (AUC ≥ 0.8), with spleen stiffness-2D MRE (AUC 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.98) and liver uptake on DCE-MRI (AUC 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.96) performing best, while SWE had AUCs of 0.63 (95% CI 0.45-0.81) for liver and 0.67 (95% CI 0.44-0.89) for spleen. Combining spleen stiffness-2D MRE and liver uptake achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1.00) for diagnosing CSPH. For predicting decompensation, spleen stiffness-3D MRE and liver uptake rate had AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.68-0.99) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.95), respectively, outperforming SWE.Spleen stiffness measured with MRE combined with gadoxetate liver uptake (measured with DCE-MRI) can diagnose CSPH and predict liver decompensation, with superior performance compared to SWE.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03436550.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40789942,Bayesian interim analysis and efficiency of phase III randomized trials.,"Improving efficiency of phase III trials is paramount for reducing costs, hastening approvals, and mitigating exposure to disadvantageous randomizations. Compared to standard frequentist interim analysis, Bayesian early stopping rules may improve efficiency by the flexibility of differential priors for efficacy and futility coupled with evaluation of clinically meaningful effect sizes.Individual patient-level data from 184,752 participants across 230 randomized two-arm parallel oncology phase III trials were manually reconstructed from primary endpoint Kaplan-Meier curves. Accrual dynamics, but not patient outcomes, were randomly varied. Bayesian Cohen's κ assessed agreement between the original analysis and the Bayesian interim analysis.Trial-level early closure was recommended based on the Bayesian interim analysis for 82 trials (36%), including 62 trials which had performed frequentist interim analysis and 33 which were already closed early by the frequentist interim analysis. Bayesian early stopping rules were 96% sensitive for detecting trials with a primary endpoint difference, and there was a high level of agreement in overall trial interpretation (κ, 0.95). Moreover, Bayesian interim analysis was associated with reduced enrollment.Bayesian interim analyses seem to improve trial efficiency by reducing enrollment requirements without compromising interpretation.© 2025.

40998130,Female sex and lung cancer risk in two large screening cohorts.,"Epidemiological studies have shown mixed results as to whether women are more susceptible to lung cancer than men. We studied 154,897 never-smokers and ever-smokers in the Prostate-Lung-Colon-Ovary (PLCO) trial and 53,452 heavy ≥30 pack-year smokers in National-Lung-Screening-Trial (NLST), 55-74 years of age. We calculated female to male lung cancer incidence rate ratios (IRR) using Poisson regression to adjust for established risk factors. In PLCO, women were more likely than men to be never smokers (56.2 % vs. 31.7 %, p < 0.01). Among ever smokers, women had fewer pack years than men (23 vs. 33 in PLCO, and 45 vs. 52 in NLST, p < 0.01). In adjusted analyses of PLCO, women had similar rates of lung cancer to men in the never-smoker group (IRR: 1.23, 95 %-confidence interval: 0.90-1.67), and the 1-15 (0.82, 0.59-1.14), 15-30 (0.95, 0.78-1.15), 30-45 (0.95, 0.80-1.11), 45-60 (0.94, 0.80-1.11), 60-75 (0.99, 0.81-1.19) and 75-100 (0.84, 0.67-1.06) pack-year groups. Lung cancer risk was lower among women in the 100+ pack year group (0.66, 0.48-0.90). In NLST, women were equally susceptible to lung cancer as men in all pack-year groups. There was no significant sex-race interaction (p > 0.05) in either trial, while there was a sex-age interaction (p = 0.02) in NLST. Our analysis of two large randomized cancer-screening trials with predominantly white participants shows that for never-smokers or ever-smokers aged >55 years, women are at similar risk of lung cancer compared to men. Consequently, lung cancer screening efforts, policies and campaigns, when addressing individuals of these demographics, should be equally focused on men and women.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

40997296,Ziftomenib in Relapsed or Refractory NPM1-Mutated AML.,"Ziftomenib-a potent, highly selective, oral menin inhibitor-was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging clinical activity as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated (NPM1-m) and KMT2A-rearranged AML in the KOMET-001 phase I trial.In the registration-enabling phase II part of KOMET-001, patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-m AML received ziftomenib 600 mg once daily. The primary end point was the rate of complete remission with full hematologic recovery (CR)/CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh).From January 26, 2023, to May 13, 2024, 92 patients (median age, 69 years [range, 33-84]) were treated. The primary end point was met, with a CR/CRh rate of 22% (95% CI, 14 to 32; P = .0058); 61% were negative for measurable residual disease. Overall response rate was 33% (95% CI, 23 to 43), with a median duration of 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 7.4). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed comparable CR/CRh regardless of previous therapy, including venetoclax, or type of comutations. Median overall survival was 6.6 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 8.6). Common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were febrile neutropenia (26%), anemia (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%). Differentiation syndrome occurred in 25% of patients (15% grade 3; no grade 4-5) and was manageable with protocol-defined mitigation. Three patients (3%) discontinued treatment because of ziftomenib-related adverse events.Ziftomenib demonstrated significant clinical benefit and deep responses in patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory NPM1-m AML.

41089215,Preprocedural CT and ECG Markers for Predicting Post-TAVR Pacemaker Requirement in High-Risk Patients.,"Need for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains a common complication. We aimed to assess computed tomography (CT)-based anatomical and electrocardiogram (ECG)-based parameters in a predictive model for PPI following TAVR.We assessed CT-based parameters, including the predicted course of the conduction axis from atrioventricular node to left bundle branch origin relative to the aortic virtual basal ring. Electrophysiological variables were combined in assessing a model to predict post-TAVR PPI.Among 433 patients (mean age 82.0 [9.0] years, 54.0% female), 90 (21.0%) required PPI.

41092834,Infectious complications in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment: A comparison of ALL-IC BFM 2009 vs. modified St. Jude total XV in a single-center retrospective cohort study.,"Infectious complications remain the major cause of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study retrospectively compared the patterns of infection in children treated with either the modified St. Jude Total XV protocol (n = 181) or the ALL-IC BFM 2009 protocol (n = 61) at a single center. Although the overall number of infection episodes was similar between the two groups, their distributions across treatment phases differed markedly. The ALL-IC BFM 2009 protocol was associated with a significantly greater incidence of infections during the induction phase, particularly in high-risk patients, who often presented with skin and gastrointestinal tract infections. In contrast, modified St. Jude Total XV protocol presented a greater infection risk during the re-induction phase. Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, were the most frequently isolated pathogens in both cohorts, although the BFM group exhibited a higher proportion of gram-negative infections. The rates of documented viral infections in BFM cohort and modified St. Jude Total XV cohort were 21.4 % vs 9.2 %, respectively. Invasive fungal infection rate was found as 6.7 % in the modified St. Jude group and 4.0 % in the BFM group is in line with the literature. Multivariate analysis confirmed that severe neutropenia and the presence of a central venous catheter were strong independent predictors of infection frequency. These findings underscore protocol-specific differences in infectious risk profiles and emphasize the importance of tailored supportive care strategies in the management of pediatric ALL.Copyright © 2025.

40983636,KBTBD11 loss promotes AKT hyperactivation and therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.,"PI3K-AKT signaling axis is often aberrantly activated in human cancers including prostate cancer, but the underlying mechanism of deregulation and tactics for effective targeting of this cancer relevant pathway remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that KBTBD11 E3 ubiquitin ligase gene is frequently deleted in human prostate cancers and that KBTBD11 loss augments AKT phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells in culture and in patient samples. We show that KBTBD11 promotes lysine-27-chain polyubiquitination at lysine 8 and 14 on AKT and antagonizes ubiquitin K63 linkage-mediated polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of AKT. KBTBD11 deficiency drove prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, but constituted as a therapeutic vulnerability to the selective AKT inhibitor in prostate cancer. Our study identifies lysine-27-chain polyubiquitination as an inhibitory mechanism of AKT activation and nominates KBTBD11 as an intrinsic upstream inhibitor of AKT. Our findings suggest that KBTBD11 deletion could be a biomarker to guide the use of the AKT inhibitors for the effective treatment of cancers such as prostate cancer.© 2025.

41146971,"Final safety and efficacy results from a phase 1/2 study of tagraxofusp, a CD123-targeted therapy, for myelofibrosis.","Patients with myelofibrosis (MF) who are resistant to or relapse after Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapy have limited treatment options and typically poor prognoses. CD123 is overexpressed in various myeloid malignancies, including MF. Tagraxofusp is a first-in-class CD123-targeted therapy, and the only drug approved globally for the rare myeloid malignancy blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. We conducted a phase 1/2 trial to determine optimal dosing, and evaluate safety and efficacy of tagraxofusp monotherapy in treatment-naïve (n = 5) MF and patients with MF resistant/refractory to JAKi (n = 25) and not eligible for stem cell transplant. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. The recommended phase 2 dose of tagraxofusp was 12 μg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days per cycle. In the safety population (n = 36) treated at 12 μg/kg per day, the most frequent grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (19%), anemia (22%), and dyspnea (11%). Capillary leak syndrome occurred in 11% of patients, all during cycle 1 with resolution in all patients. Thirty patients treated at 12 μg/kg per day were efficacy evaluable. Of 18 (n = 2 treatment-naïve, n = 16 relapsed/refractory) patients with baseline splenomegaly, 2 relapsed/refractory patients had spleen volume reduction ≥35%. In relapsed/refractory patients, 40% had total symptom score (TSS) ≥50%, and median overall survival (OS) was 19.3 months. In patients who were treatment naïve, 40% had TSS ≥50%, and median OS was 26.6 months. In this trial, tagraxofusp monotherapy in MF was well tolerated, without cumulative myelotoxicity, and with symptom score improvements, warranting further investigation in combination therapy.

41144658,Risk Factors and Outcomes of Recurrent Cytomegalovirus Infection in Heart Transplant Recipients.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for developing recurrent clinically significant cytomegalovirus infections (csCMVi) in heart transplant recipients.We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving adult heart transplant recipients at three large transplant centers in the United States between January 2011 and March 2019. All patients with a history of csCMVi, defined as CMV disease or CMV infection requiring preemptive therapy, were followed from the date of treatment completion for the primary csCMVi episode. Outcomes of interest were recurrent csCMVi and all-cause mortality.Among 98 heart transplant recipients with csCMVi, 22 (22.4%) episodes of recurrent csCMVi occurred. Median time-to-recurrent csCMVi was 31.5 (IQR 21.3-59.8) days following treatment completion. A preceding episode of CMV disease (versus infection) was associated with a lower risk of recurrent csCMVi (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-0.98; p = 0.047). Patients with lymphopenia had higher rates of recurrent csCMVi without statistical significance (HR 2.13, 95% CI 0.88-5.13; p = 0.093). Seroconversion by the end-of-therapy among CMV D+/R- mismatched patients was associated with a reduced risk of csCMVi recurrence (HR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.30; p < 0.001). Overall, 17 (17.3%) patients died during follow-up, which was not significantly higher among those with recurrent csCMVi (HR 2.13, 95% CI 0.78-5.79; p = 0.141).About one in five heart recipients with csCMVi developed post-treatment recurrence. A preceding episode of CMV disease and seroconversion was protective against recurrence. Lymphopenia may be a practical biomarker to stratify recurrence risk.

41141650,Development and Validity of a Novel Transplant Operative Assessment Tool.,"Assessment tools in surgical education help identify improvement areas for trainees. We developed and present validity evidence for a novel Transplant Operative Assessment Tool to optimize technical feedback for surgical trainees in transplantation.The Transplant Operative Assessment Tool assesses learners on anatomy, technical skills, judgment, and communication. Performance is rated across 5 competency levels. Content validity evidence included a construct map using existing literature and expert cognitive interviews. Ratings were used to develop an item response theory calibration, which was then used to evaluate the tool and provide validity evidence.Eighty-two assessments for 28 trainees (16 residents, 12 fellows) were completed by 25 faculty surgeons across 4 programs. Fifty-six kidney transplants, 13 liver transplants, and 13 donor nephrectomies were assessed. The mean assessment completion time was 4.1 ± 4.3 min. Internal structure validity was evaluated by calculating item infit (range, 0.86-1.15), indicating a strong model fit and confirming a high quality of items. Internal consistency was also high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). There was a positive correlation between ratings and training level (P < 0.01), indicating strong discriminatory power. Warm ischemia time for transplant operations did not correlate with performance (P = 0.16).These data provide validity evidence for a novel operative assessment tool. This instrument can measure performance, monitor progress, document competency, and has the potential to provide valuable feedback.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s). Transplantation Direct.

41137654,Psychosocial and Socioeconomic Factors Are Not Associated With Long-Term Survival After Lung Transplantation.,"The impact of psychosocial health and socioeconomic status (SES) on long-term lung transplant survival remains unclear.We conducted a single-center, retrospective 2:1 matched case-control study of adult lung transplant recipients (1999-2019). Cases survived ≥6 years post-transplant; controls survived <6 years. Matching was based on transplant year (±5 years) and indication. Psychosocial health and SES were assessed using the Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplant (PACT) score, Mayo Clinic Housing-Based Socioeconomic Status (HOUSES) index, and Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Secondary covariates included insurance, marital status, employment, caregiver relationship, and proximity to the transplant center. Conditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender was used.Among 189 patients (63 cases, 126 controls), PACT score, HOUSES index, and ADI were not significantly associated with long-term survival. Patients with non-family caregivers had lower odds of survival compared to those with a spouse or partner (OR = 0.16, p = 0.022). Regional residents had lower odds of long-term survival compared to local recipients (OR = 0.55, p = 0.001).Pre-transplant psychosocial and SES measures were not significantly associated with long-term survival. Caregiver relationships and geographic proximity may have a greater impact on outcomes, highlighting the importance of support systems and access to care.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

41100354,Crohn Disease Strictures: Multimodality Imaging to Identify Imaging Biomarkers.,"The morphologic imaging features of Crohn disease (CD) small bowel strictures have been defined by intersociety recommendations and expert panels. CD small bowel strictures result in penetrating and obstructing complications that often lead to surgery. Imaging biomarkers in fibrostenosing CD can be used to reproducibly diagnose and measure strictures and identify those at high risk for subsequent surgery. Emerging biomarkers seek to accurately and reproducibly identify and measure histopathologic correlates of fibrosis, inflammation, and smooth muscle hyperplasia or hypertrophy, as well as to reflect biomechanical properties such as stiffness. The authors review and define imaging features of small bowel strictures using routine MR and CT enterography, which should be incorporated into clinical reports to guide management decisions or to use in clinical trials. The most promising quantitative imaging biomarkers reflecting histopathologic composition of small bowel strictures are reviewed with a focus on MRI and US methods. Imaging is a critical tool for the management of patients with stricturing CD. ©RSNA, 2025 See also the related articles by Rieder and Ma et al and Rieder et al in Radiology.",Radiographics,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Hoodeshenas S|Dillman J R|Taylor S A|Rimola J|Taouli B|Robinson K A|Lu A|Bartlett D J|Bruining D H|Hagen C E|Goenka A H|Chen S|Rieder F|Feagan B|Baker M E|Fletcher J G,Hoodeshenas S|Dillman J R|Taylor S A|Rimola J|Taouli B|Robinson K A|Lu A|Bartlett D J|Bruining D H|Hagen C E|Goenka A H|Chen S|Rieder F|Feagan B|Baker M E|Fletcher J G,"From the Department of Radiology (S.H., K.A.R., A.L., D.J.B., A.H.G., S.C., J.G.F.), Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (D.H.B.), and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (C.E.H.), Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905; Department of Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio (J.R.D.); Center for Medical Imaging, University College London, London, UK (S.A.T.); IBD Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain (J.R.); Department of Diagnostic, Molecular, and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (B.T.); Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (F.R.); Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Digestive Diseases and Surgery Institute and Program for Global Translational Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (F.R.); Alimentiv, London, Ontario, Canada (B.F.); Department of Medicine and Department of Epidemiology and Statistics, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada (B.F.); and Imaging Institute, Digestive Diseases and Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (M.E.B.).","Hoodeshenas S, Dillman J R, Taylor S A, Rimola J, Taouli B, Robinson K A, Lu A, Bartlett D J, Bruining D H, Hagen C E, Goenka A H, Chen S, Rieder F, Feagan B, Baker M E, Fletcher J G",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41100354/,"The key finding of this medical research is that imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT, can be used to accurately identify and measure the severity of Crohn's disease strictures, which can help guide treatment decisions and clinical trials.

41126899,Bracing for Impact: A Comparative Analysis of Treatment Patterns for Pediatric Torus Fractures of the Radius.,"Distal radius torus fractures are common pediatric injuries traditionally managed with rigid casts. However, level 1 evidence supports non-rigid immobilization due to improved recovery, fewer complications, enhanced patient comfort, and decreased costs. This study evaluated treatment patterns for these fractures across academic and community hospitals, comparing outcomes and costs between casting and bracing. We hypothesized that casting would remain prevalent, especially in community settings and among non-orthopaedic providers.A retrospective review of electronic health records from 2020 to 2022 identified 386 patients with nondisplaced distal radial torus fractures. Data from academic and community hospitals were analyzed. Treatment method (cast vs. brace), demographic variables, provider type, and treatment outcomes were recorded.The mean age was 8.34 years (range 0-16), 209 (54.1%) were male, and 153 (42.5%) had a concomitant ulnar fracture. Casting was utilized in 275 (71.2%) patients, while 111 (28.8%) received bracing. Physician assistants (PAs) managed most cases (41.2%), followed by orthopaedic surgeons (28.8%), orthopaedic residents (10.6%), nurse practitioners (10.1%), and other physicians (9.3%). Most patients presented to community healthcare centers (78.8%), while 82 (21.2%) presented to an academic institution.Casting was most frequently performed by non-orthopaedic surgery providers, especially PAs (83.6% casting rate, P < .001). Patients treated with casting had significantly higher complication rates (11.6% vs. 2.7%, P = .006). Patients treated with casting had longer immobilization (6.08 weeks vs. 4.68 weeks, P < .001), required more X-rays (3.33 vs. 2.76, P < .001), and incurred higher healthcare costs ($5,774.55 vs. $4,415.86, P < .001). Logistic regression identified PAs and orthopaedic residents as independent predictors of casting, while the presence of a concomitant ulnar fracture reduced the likelihood of casting (OR = 0.454, P = .003).Our findings reveal a gap between clinical evidence and current practice in treating pediatric radius torus fractures. While casting remains the predominant modality, bracing was associated with fewer complications, shorter immobilization time, and lower costs. These findings confirm bracing as the superior treatment option and highlight the need for targeted provider education.(1)Bracing pediatric distal radius torus fractures results in fewer complications, shorter immobilization times, and lower estimated costs compared to casting.(2)Physician assistants and orthopaedic surgery residents were more likely to choose casting.(3)Institutional protocols and provider education play a key role in transitioning clinical practice to support the use of bracing for these fractures.III (retrospective comparative study).© 2025 The Author(s).",Journal of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Varas-Rodríguez E|Grigoriou E|Huddleston P M|Milbrandt T|Larson A N,Varas-Rodríguez E|Grigoriou E|Huddleston P M|Milbrandt T|Larson A N,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Varas-Rodríguez E, Grigoriou E, Huddleston P M, Milbrandt T, Larson A N",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41126899/,"(1) Bracing is a superior treatment for pediatric distal radius torus fractures compared to casting, as it leads to fewer complications, shorter immobilization times, and lower costs.

41109234,Neuropathological changes and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease treated with aducanumab versus untreated: a retrospective case-control study.,"Understanding the neuropathological effects of amyloid β (Aβ)-targeting therapies and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in Alzheimer's disease is critical for optimising treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Comparing Aβ PET imaging with neuropathological assessments provides context for evaluating the extent of Aβ clearance and interpreting in-vivo biomarkers. We aimed to assess clinicopathological changes and ARIA-related effects in aducanumab-treated versus untreated Alzheimer's disease.This retrospective case-control study included five aducanumab-treated participants from clinical trials conducted at the Mayo Clinic (2016-21) who underwent autopsy (2020-23). Treated participants were matched by autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation or APOE genotype, age at cognitive symptom onset, and sex to 12 untreated participants from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging cohorts in the Mayo Clinic brain bank (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Cognitive, imaging, and neuropathological outcomes were compared using descriptive analyses and Mann-Whitney U tests.Aducanumab-treated participants comprised four males and one female, all carrying at least one APOE ∊4 allele, with two harbouring a PSEN1 mutation. Cumulative dosages of aducanumab ranged from 5 mg/kg to 241 mg/kg; all participants cognitively declined during treatment, and two exhibited ARIA. Reductions in [18F]florbetapir PET Centiloid values ranged from -6% to -81% compared with baseline. Treatment-to-death intervals ranged from 5 months to 41 months. Neuropathological analyses revealed clearance of Aβaa1-8 and Aβ42 localised to cortical layer I in treated participants, with no significant clearance in deeper cortical layers. Regions corresponding to ARIA on MRI showed microinfarcts with haemosiderin, complement activation, and CD68-positive vessel walls originating from Aβ-laden leptomeningeal and penetrating vessels.Disproportionate Aβ clearance and ARIA-associated neuropathology localised to superficial cortical layers suggest a distinctive pattern of target engagement by aducanumab. These findings inform understanding and monitoring of similar Aβ-targeting therapies.Alzheimer Nederland, National Institute on Aging, and Alzheimer's Association.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41104976,Metastatic Meningioma: Neuroradiologic and Molecular Imaging Perspectives.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors, arising from arachnoid cap cells and typically following a benign clinical course. However, a minority of cases-particularly higher-grade meningiomas-exhibit aggressive behavior, including local invasion, recurrence, and, in rare instances, extracranial metastasis. Metastatic meningioma, defined as dissemination beyond the cranial and spinal compartments, remains exceptionally uncommon, with reported incidence ranging from 0.1% to 0.76%. Common metastatic sites include the lungs, bone, liver, and lymph nodes, although virtually any organ may be involved. Proposed mechanisms of spread include hematogenous dissemination via venous sinuses, cerebrospinal fluid seeding in high-grade variants, and possibly lymphatic dissemination. Imaging features that suggest metastatic potential include irregular margins, heterogeneous enhancement, prominent peritumoral edema, and bone destruction. Advanced modalities, such as gallium 68 DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide PET/CT and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, play an increasing role in detecting and characterizing both known and occult metastatic lesions. Molecular alterations, including TERT promoter mutations, CDKN2A/B deletions, and somatostatin receptor 2 overexpression, are increasingly recognized as important markers for risk stratification and targeted therapy selection. Management requires a multimodal approach, including surgery, radiation therapy, and emerging systemic options such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given the rarity and clinical complexity of this entity, radiologists must maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly while evaluating in high-grade or recurrent meningiomas.

40983112,Comparative effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular outcomes among adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate cardiovascular risk: emulation of a target trial.,"To compare the cardiovascular outcomes of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) at moderate cardiovascular risk.We emulated a target trial using claims data of adults with T2D at moderate cardiovascular risk who initiated dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, or semaglutide between 01/01/2014-12/31/2021. Random treatment assignment was emulated by propensity scores and incorporated into inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox models. Outcomes were time to composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality), expanded MACE (MACE, hospitalization for heart failure, and revascularization) and its components, and severe hypoglycemia.After IPTW, 35,572 patients initiated dulaglutide, 4376 initiated exenatide, 8843 initiated liraglutide, and 33,063 initiated semaglutide. Compared to dulaglutide, semaglutide was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR 0.85, 95CI % 0.78-0.93), expanded MACE (HR 0.92, 95CI % 0.87-0.96), all-cause mortality (HR 0.81, 95CI % 0.71-0.92), stroke (HR 0.82, 95CI % 0.70-0.97), and revascularization (HR 0.93, 95CI % 0.88-0.99), while liraglutide was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR 0.84, 95CI % 0.72-0.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.79, 95CI % 0.64-0.99).Among GLP-1RAs, semaglutide and liraglutide were associated with the greatest cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with T2D at moderate cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40882500,"Diagnostic screening for epilepsy, functional neurological disorder, and other paroxysmal disorders: A clinical survey study.","Seizures, or seizure-like events, can indicate over 50 neurological disorders, and interpretation of patient-reported symptoms is subjective, leading to misdiagnosis. This study aimed to determine diagnostic utility of multi-choice questions to assess seizures in a clinical setting.This retrospective study of Mayo Clinic neurology patients (2016 - 2021) analysed de-identified Electronic Health Records from adults with a paroxysmal disorder who completed Mayo Clinic's 'Epilepsy Pre-screening Questionnaire'. Diagnostic groups were epilepsy, functional neurological disorder (FND), syncope, and other neurological disorders. The main outcome was group-level separability of survey responses between diagnostic groups (assessed from response proportions using a chi-squared test with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons).4,130 records were included for epilepsy (n = 3,194), FND (n = 214), syncope (n = 101), other (n = 621). Seven multichoice questions provided significant separability between diagnostic groups, with event duration, specific warnings and symptoms providing greatest diagnostic utility. Those with syncope were significantly more likely to report short events, of a few seconds, compared to every other group (syncope: 27 %, other: 11 %, epilepsy: 9 %, FND: 1 %). People with FND were also significantly more likely to report events > 7 min (27 %), compared to those with epilepsy (11 %). Conversely, events lasting < 1 min were still reported by 23 % of people with FND and long seizures (>7 mins) were reported by almost 10 % of people with epilepsy. Pre-seizure warnings were similar for focal and generalised epilepsy, contradicting the assumption that auras are mainly associated with focal epilepsy.The results validate the diagnostic utility of general questions about event duration, related symptoms and comorbidities in a meaningfully sampled patient cohort that was representative of people presenting with seizures or seizure-like events presumed to be epilepsy (i.e. not people presenting with an obvious diagnosis of non-epileptic seizures). Findings could inform development of standardised, patient-reported surveys to aid differential diagnosis across common neurological conditions.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40876110,A standardized fluoroscopic sequence to reveal residual MCL instability after repair of the LUCL in elbow injury.,"Indications for stabilization of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) after repair of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL) remain controversial. Here, we propose a standardized fluoroscopic sequence to reveal residual medial elbow instability to facilitate intraoperative decision-making.Eight matched cadaveric upper extremity pairs (N = 16) were mounted to simulate intraoperative positioning. Fluoroscopic images were acquired using the following: full extension, 45-degree flexion, 90-degree flexion, and full flexion with the forearm in neutral/pronation/supination. These were acquired at ""baseline"" and following destabilization of the LUCL/MCL. The proposed fluoroscopic sequence was then repeated following surgical fixation of the LUCL (""post-LUCL repair"") followed by MCL repair (""post-LUCL & MCL repair). Blinded images were fitted using a best-fit circle to compute ulnohumeral distance (UHD, millimeters) and determine residual lateral (supination) and medial (pronation) instability defined by the presence of a drop sign (UHD>4 mm). Radiocapitellar ratio (RCR) was computed to determine radiocapitellar instability (RCR>10 %). Blinded images were also qualitatively evaluated against the contralateral baseline to simulate intraoperative assessment.Apparent instability in supination status-post destabilization resolved following LUCL repair with evident residual medial-sided instability showed in pronation, which resolved after MCL fixation. Evaluation of the drop sign at 45 and 90 degrees of flexion showed comparable quantitative sensitivity at 97 % and 98 %, unlike in full extension or full flexion (sensitivity <35 %). Quantitative sensitivity was 88 % for RCR in mid-flexion. Qualitative evaluation for the drop sign and RCR resulted in sensitivity of 93 and 75 %, respectively.The proposed fluoroscopic sequence provides reliable intraoperative assessment to evaluate for residual medial-sided instability in the setting of multi-ligamentous elbow injuries. After repair of the LUCL, medial residual instability due to MCL rupture is best revealed with the presence of a drop sign in full pronation and midflexion.IV.Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Injury,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Champagne A A|Paul A V|Puneky G A|Brown M J|Torrey J S|Anakwenze O A|Saltzman E B|Beingessner D M|Tangtiphaiboontana J|Ruch D S|Klifto C S|Hebert-Davies J|DeBaun M R,Tangtiphaiboontana J,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.

40875358,Role of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases in MASH-driven hepatocellular carcinoma and ferroptosis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (MASH-HCC) incidence is rapidly rising worldwide. Lipid metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of solid tumors to satisfy cancer's high metabolic demand. However, it may confer sensitivity to ferroptosis, a cell death mode driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. In this report, we describe the lipid metabolic landscape in MASH-HCC and characterize long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), a family of enzymes involved in the synthesis of cellular lipids. Bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry analyses of human MASH-HCC were integrated to identify differentially expressed lipid metabolism genes. Ferroptosis in vitro was assessed in human HCC cell lines. The characterization of ACSLs was also conducted at the single-cell level in a diet-induced experimental murine model of MASH-HCC. Our analysis revealed that in human MASH-HCC, ACSLs exhibit a heterogeneous expression, with ACSL4 notably enriched in tumor tissues, contrasting with ACSL5 upregulation in noncancerous MASH. We identified a unique lipid metabolic gene signature of MASH-HCC, which included genes associated with ferroptosis vulnerability. In vitro, high ACSL4 expression was associated with increased ferroptosis sensitivity in human HCC cell lines. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed elevated ACSL4 expression in immune cells in a murine MASH-HCC model, suggesting a role of ACSL4 in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment. Overall, this report offers new insights into the lipid metabolic landscape and ferroptosis sensitivity for novel MASH-HCC treatments.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study examined healthy human MASH and MASH-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (MASH-HCC) livers using bulk and scRNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry. We found that ACSLs displayed differential and spatially heterogeneous expression. ACSL4 was abundant in tumor tissues, whereas ACSL5 was elevated in noncancerous MASH tissues. ACSL4 was mainly found in immune cells like natural killer cells and natural killer T cells in murine MASH-HCC, suggesting its role in tumor immune microenvironment modulation.",American journal of physiology.

40851353,Cologastric Inhibition: Upper Gastrointestinal Dysfunction With Slow Colonic Transit.,"Upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions frequently coexist, potentially mediated by gastrocolonic or cologastric neural reflexes. This study aims to assess the prevalence of impaired gastric accommodation (GA) and delayed gastric emptying (GE) among patients with slow colonic transit (CT), dyssynergic defecation (DD), and to evaluate relationships between CT or DD with impaired GA and delayed GE.We reviewed records of 178 adult patients at Mayo Clinic (2005-2025) with documented slow CT or DD (respectively based on scintigraphy and high-resolution anorectal manometry [ARM] and balloon expulsion [BE]) who underwent 99mTc-SPECT measurement of GA and scintigraphic GE of 320-kcal, 30% fat egg meal. Slow CT was defined by geometric center (GC) at 48 h < 2.1 for males and < 1.9 for females. Abnormal GA ratio was assessed as reduced < 2.62 or increased > 3.85, and delayed GE % < 75% at 4 h. Correlations were assessed using Spearman rank test.Reduced GA was found in 23.7% with DD and 26.7% with slow CT, while increased GA was observed in 30.1% and 24.4%, respectively. Delayed GE was present in 20.5% DD patients and 35.6% slow CT patients. GC 48 h and 24 h were positively correlated with GE% 4 h (Rs = 0.279, and Rs = 0.294 respectively, both p < 0.001) suggesting slow CT retards GE. GC 48 h was moderately correlated with resting anal pressure (Rs = 0.259, p < 0.001) and negatively with the rectoanal pressure gradient (Rs = -0.166, p = 0.027). No significant correlations were observed between CT and GA.Slow CT is associated with slower GE, suggesting cologastric reflex inhibition, but not with GA.

40849023,The Relationship Between ICD Knowledge and Goals of Care in a Diverse Patient Population.,"Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) can be lifesaving, but ICD shocks are also associated with worse quality of life and emotional distress for patients and their families, particularly near the end of life. Shared decision-making regarding deactivation is critical, yet it can be challenging due to limited patient understanding of their devices. Existing ICD educational materials often lack cultural and linguistic inclusivity, contributing to disparities in end-of-life care for Black and Hispanic patients.Patients with active ICDs at a large, urban safety net hospital completed a pre-survey, then watched a 7- to 9-minute video on the functions and deactivation of ICDs. Afterward, patients were surveyed about their ICD knowledge, preferences regarding four hypothetical end-of-life scenarios, and personal experiences.Of 50 participants, 58% were non-Hispanic Black, 24% non-Hispanic White, and 18% Hispanic White. ICD knowledge improved significantly from 47.4% to 80.8% (P < 0.001). Knowledge improvement was similar for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White cohorts but lower for Hispanic White patients (P = 0.0001). Preferences for ICD deactivation changed for 72% of participants with hypothetical scenarios involving ""being a caregiving burden"" (P = 0.009) and ""having no hope of recovery"" (P = 0.001) showing the greatest increases in ICD deactivation preference.Educational decision aids specific to a patient population can reduce disparities in ICD knowledge and promote informed decision-making, particularly in underserved populations. Improving patients' understanding of their devices increased certainty and preference for ICD deactivation in end-of-life scenarios. Despite promising results, persistently lower knowledge in Hispanic White patients signals the need for tailored educational strategies.Copyright © 2025 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

40845595,Usability and postural benefits of passive back-support exoskeletons in vascular surgery: A preliminary study.,"The awkward trunk postures such as static flexion and twisting required of surgeons in the operating room are a major contributing factor to the high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders amongst surgeons. One intervention that is currently proposed to reduce the strain associated with awkward intraoperative postures are passive exoskeletons worn intraoperatively. In this study, we measured the intraoperative postures, subjective discomfort, and workload as well as the usability associated with two commercially available exoskeletons during three types of vascular surgery and compared the results between a baseline (not using exoskeleton) and two different trunk exoskeletons (Laevo and HeroWear). A linear mixed model found that while the exoskeletons did not significantly interfere with surgical workflow, use of the exoskeletons did not significantly affect intraoperative trunk postures (28° vs. 27° vs. 34°, p > .05), subjective discomfort change (2.0 vs. 1.25 vs. 1.92, p = .807 in the low back) (3.00 vs. 1.58 vs. 2.58, p = .454 in the upper back), and (3.00 vs. 2.75 vs. 1.92, 0.153 overall fatigue change), or workload in vascular surgeons.

40841214,Sleeve to gastric bypass conversion: a multiinstitutional study of 217 patients.,"Revision of a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is indicated for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and for weight recurrence. Existing literature is conflicting and lacks long-term follow-up.To evaluate the resolution of GERD and additional weight loss after conversion of SG to RYGB.Retrospective study of prospectively maintained multicentric bariatric surgery data sets.Patients who underwent a conversion from SG to RYGB were divided in two groups based on the indication (GERD versus weight). Outcomes included total weight loss (TWL), GERD symptoms resolution, nutritional parameters, and postoperative complications such as reoperations and readmissions. The outcomes were compared between both groups.One hundred twenty-four patients with GERD versus 93 weight patients were included in the study. At the time of the revision, the weight group had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (42.3 ± 5.5 versus 34.7 ± 6.6kg/m2, P < .0001). Both groups achieved comparable TWL following the revision (GERD:13 ± 8% versus weight 16 ± 7%, P = .529; 23/93 lost to follow-up in the weight group). At the 1-year follow-up, more than 75% of the patients had their GERD symptoms resolved (18/124 lost to follow-up). For postoperative outcomes, immediate postoperative complications were comparable between both groups (P = .754). Over an average follow-up period of 4 years following the revision, patients with GERD had more late reoperations (GERD: 14% versus weight: 4%, P = .016).SG-to-RYGB conversion for GERD or weight recurrence helped achieve resolution of GERD symptoms as well as additional weight loss. GERD patients suffered from worse clinical outcomes following a revision RYGB in comparison to the weight recurrence patients.Copyright © 2025 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

40840840,The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2024 Member Practice Survey.,"The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) has conducted a practice survey every 5 years since 1974 to guide decision-making and resource allocation.The 2024 Practice Survey, conducted online between January 25 and March 14, 2024, included a 72-question survey distributed to 4692 active STS members from the Senior, Surgeon, and Resident/Fellow member categories. A total of 1027 responses (22%) were received and interpreted. Other nonsurgeon members were not included in this survey.Most surgeon respondents were men (86%) and White (65%), with an increased representation of women in the field. Mean respondent age was 55.8 years. The traditional training pathway remains prevalent (87%), although additional training beyond cardiothoracic residency increased to 41%. An increase has occurred in academic (46%) and government (2%) positions, whereas hospital-based and private practice positions have declined. Overall career satisfaction was 80% (43% very satisfied and 37% somewhat satisfied). In addition, symptoms of burnout and depression along with workplace challenges, including discrimination and harassment, were reported by 55.7% of surgeons. The average salary for STS members is commensurate with the 2024 STS Compensation Survey. Research participation has declined slightly. Lastly, the use of electronic health records is evolving, with more surgeons finding them easier to use compared with previous years.This member survey highlighted that cardiothoracic surgeons are largely satisfied with their career, but also identified challenges in work-life balance. The STS remains committed to supporting its members by addressing their evolving career practices and needs, fostering professional growth, and advancing the field of cardiothoracic surgery.Copyright © 2025.

40835154,Metabolic Bariatric Surgery in Kidney Transplant Candidates.,"Patients with obesity are the largest and fastest-growing demographic among individuals with renal failure in the United States. Transplant centers often reject patients with high body mass index due to the risk of posttransplant complications. Metabolic bariatric surgery, the most efficient and durable weight loss method, can facilitate a timely kidney transplant listing and improve obesity-related comorbidities in a relatively safe manner. In this review, we identify kidney transplant candidates who are likely to benefit from metabolic bariatric surgery, discuss the potential risks of the procedure, and propose postsurgery monitoring and management to optimize safety and maximize the benefits of this therapy.Copyright © 2025.

40833470,The effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on depressive symptoms and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Anxiety and depression are major global health concerns that can manifest as primary disorders or as comorbid symptoms alongside other medical conditions. Due to the troubling side effects and treatment resistance associated with conventional pharmacological interventions, therapeutic agents that target oxidative stress and inflammation, such as CoQ10, have been considered.To quantitatively evaluate the effect of CoQ10 on symptoms of depression and anxiety across different clinical populations.We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and comprehensively searched relevant databases up to March 2025. The primary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptoms measured by different validated scales. We estimated pooled effect estimates using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and applying random-effects models.We identified seven small trials with up to 400 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, of which six studies were included in the meta-analysis. CoQ10 demonstrated significant improvement in depression severity compared to placebo in trials using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 6-8 weeks after treatment initiation (3 trials, 158 patients, std. mean difference [95% CI] -0.97 [-1.49, -0.45]), and at low daily doses (3 trials, 193 patients, -0.84 [-1.54, -0.14]). No significant effects were observed in trials using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (3 trials, 146 patients, -0.12 [-0.68, 0.43]). Regarding anxiety severity, only two small studies were analyzed, and no statistically significant reduction was observed with CoQ10 (101 patients, -0.28 [-0.70, 0.13]).Our analysis provided limited evidence that CoQ10 may improve depressive symptoms when administered in low doses (100-200 mg/day) and for short durations (6-8 weeks). More data is needed for a reliable assessment of the effects of Coenzyme Q10 on both depression and anxiety.© 2025.

40831019,Artifacts in Urodynamic Studies: A Narrative Review.,"Urodynamic studies (UDS) are integral to the evaluation and management of lower urinary tract dysfunction. However, artifacts are frequently encountered, affecting both clinical interpretation and research reliability.This expert narrative review examines the prevalence, classification, and clinical relevance of artifacts encountered during UDS, based on findings from the existing literature.A focused literature review was conducted, analyzing studies that reported data on the sources and impact of UDS artifacts, particularly from the patient perspective. Emphasis was placed on identifying both technical and patient-related contributors to artifact generation.Artifacts are common in UDS despite adherence to Good Urodynamic Practices recommended by the International Continence Society. Technical artifacts may stem from equipment-related issues such as calibration errors, catheter displacement, and device variability. Patient-related artifacts can arise from physical movement or test-induced detrusor overactivity. These artifacts may lead to misinterpretation, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate interventions in clinical practice. Furthermore, they may affect the validity of research findings related to diagnostic tools for lower urinary tract symptoms.Identifying and addressing UDS artifacts during the procedure or in post-test interpretation is critical for accurate clinical decision-making and reliable research outcomes. Efforts to minimize artifacts should be prioritized to improve the quality and utility of UDS.© 2025 The Author(s).

Previous studies support benefits of SPC for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (pALS) and their caregivers; however, few studies have compared patient and caregiver experiences with ALS care and SPC.An online survey assessing satisfaction with care was distributed to pALS and caregivers who had received SPC. Those who completed the survey were also invited to participate in a semi-structured interview.Thirty-four people (10 pALS, 25 caregivers) from 26 ALS clinics in 20 states completed the survey. Sixteen also provided a qualitative interview. Respondents were most commonly satisfied with their ALS team's ability to answer questions (81%), counsel them regarding ALS medications (78%), and manage motor symptoms (77%). Respondents were least commonly satisfied with their ALS team's ability to manage mood (50%), address spiritual/existential concerns (48%), and help them find in-home care providers (38%). SPC was initiated an average of 14.6 months after ALS diagnosis. Respondents were most commonly satisfied with their SPC team's responsiveness to time-sensitive needs between scheduled visits (82%) and management of mood (80%) and non-pain physical symptoms (73%). Respondents were least commonly satisfied with their SPC team's ability to help with equipment needs (52%), make decisions about procedures (50%), and find in-home caregivers (46%).

40820078,Developing biomarkers and methods of risk stratification: Consensus statements from the International Kidney Cancer Symposium North America 2024 Think Tank.,"Accurate prognostication and personalized treatment selection remain major challenges in kidney cancer. This consensus initiative aimed to provide actionable expert guidance on the development and clinical integration of prognostic and predictive biomarkers and risk stratification tools to improve patient care and guide future research. A modified Delphi method was employed to develop consensus statements among a multidisciplinary panel of experts in urologic oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, molecular biology, radiology, outcomes research, biostatistics, industry, and patient advocacy. Over 3 rounds, including an in-person meeting 20 initial statements were evaluated, refined, and voted on. Consensus was defined a priori as a median Likert score ≥8. Nineteen final consensus statements were endorsed. These span key domains including biomarker prioritization (favoring prognostic biomarkers), rigorous methodology for subgroup and predictive analyses, the development of multi-institutional prospective registries, incorporation of biomarkers in trial design, and improvements in data/biospecimen access. The panel also identified high-priority biomarker types (e.g., AI-based image analysis, ctDNA) for future research. This is the first consensus statement specifically focused on biomarker and risk model development for kidney cancer using a structured Delphi process. The recommendations emphasize the need for rigorous methodology, collaborative infrastructure, prospective data collection, and focus on clinically translatable biomarkers. The resulting framework is intended to guide researchers, cooperative groups, and stakeholders in advancing personalized care for patients with kidney cancer.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40819908,"Diagnostic Utility of PRAME in Rare Melanoma Mimics: A Comparative Analysis Including GNET, MMNST, Epithelioid MPNST, and MITF-Rearranged Melanocytic Tumors.","Differentiating metastatic melanoma from histologic mimics such as malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumor (GNET), malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumor (MMNST), and epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (EMPNST) poses significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping morphology and immunophenotypes. PRAME is a novel immunohistochemical marker increasingly used to distinguish melanoma from its mimics, but remains underexplored in these rare tumor types.PRAME immunohistochemistry was performed on four GNETs, seven MMNSTs, 10 EMPNSTs, 16 metastatic melanomas (including eight undifferentiated melanomas), and two MITF-rearranged melanocytic tumors. PRAME expression was scored from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of tumor nuclei showing moderate to strong staining.All GNETs, MMNSTs, and MITF-rearranged tumors were PRAME-negative. EMPNSTs showed variable expression: six were negative (0-1), one equivocal (2+), and three positive (3-4+). Fifteen of 16 melanomas were PRAME-positive. PRAME scores differed significantly among tumor types (p = 1.99 × 10-5). PRAME demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing metastatic melanoma from primary mimickers including GNET and MMNST, but low specificity in EMPNST (71.4%).PRAME reliably distinguishes metastatic melanoma from GNET and MMNST, supporting its use in this differential. However, its reduced specificity in EMPNST limits its standalone diagnostic value in this context, emphasizing the need for a multimodal approach.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40819343,High-resolution microCT to assess breast microcalcification morphometry by histologic lesion subtype and radiologic classification.,"To assess associations of 3D morphometry of breast calcifications, determined using high-resolution microCT, with underlying histopathology and evaluate the potential for classifying tissue calcifications as an aid in optimizing identification and diagnosis of the most severe pathology in a biopsy.We compared morphometry of calcifications in tissue blocks (n = 156) of benign breast disease (n = 74), ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 39), and ductal carcinoma in situ with invasive breast cancer (n = 43) using (10 µm) microCT. Matched sections were reviewed microscopically to define lesion(s) in which calcifications were embedded. 3D reconstructions of calcifications were reviewed independently by two masked radiologists to assess the need for biopsy and calcification morphology. Calcification morphometry was compared to pathologic diagnosis using linear mixed models.A total of 12,216 calcifications (IQR 9-66 per specimen) were analyzed. Individual breast cancer-associated calcifications were significantly larger than benign breast disease-associated calcifications (padjusted = 0.012) and calcification volume was positively associated with grade of ductal carcinoma in situ (Ptrend = 0.009). Structure model index revealed more cylindrical shape in breast cancer calcifications versus benign breast disease calcifications (padjusted = 0.008). Re-analysis by the specific microscopic lesion containing the calcification, rather than the most severe diagnosis per biopsy, strengthened associations. Radiologists agreed on biopsy recommendation in 92% of microCT images, while achieving sensitivities of 53.1% and 54.3%. and specificities of 50.0% and 54.1%.Our analysis provides proof-of-concept that morphometry of tissue calcifications varies by lesion type, suggesting that future studies may enable development of a pathologic classification linked to diagnosis and mammographic findings.© 2025.

40816619,Developing physically and psychologically safe exercise spaces: Insights from women veterans on trauma-informed exercise interventions.,"Exercise benefits both physical and mental health. However, women veterans (WVs) face unique barriers to exercise which may be mitigated by trauma-informed practices such as incorporating lived experience into program development. This study engaged WVs to identify their exercise preferences and perceptions, aiming to inform future development of trauma-informed exercise interventions. WVs enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study were invited to participate in this mixed-methods pilot study, which included a survey and qualitative interview to explore exercise preferences, barriers, and facilitators. Twelve WVs (mean age = 47.7 years; 58.3 % white; 58.3 % lifetime PTSD; 33.3 % lifetime TBI) completed the survey and interview. All WVs were interested in an exercise program tailored to their needs. Exercise preferences were mixed, with preferences for home-based (n = 8, 67 %), group supervision (n = 7, 58 %), moderate-intensity (n = 9, 75 %) programs that take place with other WVs. Endorsed exercise types included walking (n = 10, 83 %), weight training (n = 9, 75 %), and yoga (n = 9, 75 %). Strongest barriers to exercise were low motivation (n = 7, 58 %) and time constraints (n = 5, 42 %), and strongest motivators were promoting mental health (n = 10, 83 %), preventing disease (n = 9, 75 %), and improving or maintaining physical fitness (n = 9, 75 %). Interviews highlighted the prevalence of sexual and partner violence throughout WVs lives and their impact on exercise engagement.

40813897,Dose individualisation of antibiotics in critically ill patients with inflammation: A narrative review.,"Due to extensive pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients, standard dosing of antibiotics may lead to inadequate drug exposure. This is concerning, as insufficient plasma drug concentrations may lead to treatment failure, whereas excessive drug exposure may increase the risk of toxic adverse events. The role of inflammation as a factor influencing the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of antibiotics remains largely unknown. PK/PD target attainment of antibiotics can be improved through therapeutic drug monitoring, i.e., measurement of drug concentrations in the blood with subsequent dosage adjustment to reach a certain target. Besides, population PK models may be used to predict drug exposure and tailor dosing in an individual patient (model-informed precision dosing). Inflammatory biomarkers have been proposed to measure inflammation levels and guide antibiotic treatment. However, their potential to guide antibiotic dosing is unclear. This narrative review describes associations between inflammation and PK/PD of antibiotics in critically ill patients, and the role of biomarkers, therapeutic drug monitoring and model-informed precision dosing in improving antibiotic dosing. A focus of future research should be on the interplay between inflammation and PK/PD of antibiotics by including inflammatory biomarkers in PK/PD models and using big data to predict antibiotic exposure in critically ill patients.© 2025 The Author(s).

40810375,Safety of Hemorrhoid Procedures in Patients Who Are Immunocompromised: The Mayo Clinic Experience.,"Hemorrhoidal disease and immunosuppression are prevalent. Management of hemorrhoidal disease in this patient population is challenging. Most societies recommend conservative management due to the presumed risks of morbid complications, including sepsis and impaired healing. Data on the risks of office-based and operative procedures in immunocompromised patients are scant.To evaluate postoperative outcomes after both office-based procedures and operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease in immunocompromised patients.Retrospective medical record review.Single-center, tertiary referral center.Adult patients were included who had hemorrhoidal disease and primarily medication-induced immunosuppression and were undergoing an office-based procedure or operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease while on immunosuppression at Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2010 and 2023.The primary outcome was the development of infectious complications or wound complications.Fifty-five immunocompromised patients, with a median age of 60 years, underwent a total of 68 hemorrhoidal procedures during the study time frame. All patients had immunosuppression induced by medication, except for 1 patient with bone marrow failure syndrome. The most common reason for immunosuppression was rheumatoid arthritis, followed by prior kidney transplant. The most common medications were chronic corticosteroids and methotrexate in more than one-third of patients each. Of 68 total interventions, hemorrhoidectomy (32%) and excision of a thrombosed hemorrhoid (26%) were the 2 most common operations performed. Sixteen adverse events were reported in 14 patients (25%). Three cases of postoperative cellulitis were documented after thrombosed external hemorrhoid excision, hemorrhoidopexy, and Whitehead hemorrhoidectomy. No postoperative intravenous antibiotics were administered. No cases of pelvic sepsis were documented.The retrospective nature of the study and the heterogeneity of the study population.These data suggest that office-based and surgical procedures are safe and feasible in patients with immunosuppression.

40799010,Prevalence and Perception of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Childhood Cancer Patients: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage among childhood cancer patients remains understudied. Factors associated with CAM use and motivations of caregivers for using CAM remain poorly understood.This cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted among caregivers of patients aged ≤18 years with confirmed cancer diagnoses. Caregivers were interviewed regarding CAM use, reasons for using/non-using CAM, and views on CAM. Logistic regression identified factors associated with CAM use, whereas qualitative interviews explored motivations and barriers. The impact of CAM usage on 2-year overall survival was explored.Out of 450 respondents, CAM usage was reported by 35.78% (n = 161), with home remedies (28.44%, n = 128) and AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Yoga, Homeopathy) therapies (13.56%, n = 61) being most common. CAM use was associated with symptom duration ≥30 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.09-2.67; p = 0·019) and hematological malignancies (aOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.33-3.17; p = 0·001). Major motivations for CAM use included belief in effectiveness (44.72%, n = 72) and family recommendations (34.16%, n = 55). Qualitative interviews highlighted cost, accessibility issues, and diagnostic delays as key drivers of CAM adoption. The 2-year survival probabilities of CAM users and nonusers were comparable (0.88 [95% CI: 0.83-0.94] vs. 0.87 [95% CI: 0.83-0.92], log-rank p = 0.75).CAM is frequently used by pediatric cancer patients, driven by caregiver beliefs, family influence, and access barriers.

40876761,A systematic review of particle-based treatment modalities for adenoid cystic carcinomas of the head and neck.,"Determine efficacy (local control, overall survival, and toxicities) of particle-based therapy (fast neutron therapy (FNT), proton beam therapy (PBT), carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT)) in the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the head and neck.This systematic literature review was conducted with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All published work on the treatment of ACCs through particle-based treatment modalities (FNT, PBT, CIRT) with adequate reporting of patient outcomes in the English language were considered eligible for this systematic review.44 studies (6 FNT, 16 PBT, 12 CIRT, and 10 multiple particles) reporting on ACC patient outcomes following particle therapy were included in this review. There were 41 retrospective and 3 prospective studies. Each particle modality was split into 2 series to ensure equitable evaluation. The median local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) rates were as follows: FNT consecutive 5-year 57 % & 72 %, FNT independent 5-year 61 % & 89.4 %, PBT ACC 2-year 94 % & 5-year 76 %, PBT mixed histology 2-year 89 % & 3-year 77.7 %, CIRT ACC 5-year 68.6 % & 74 %, and CIRT mixed histology 5-year 68% & 59.7%. The most common toxicities across the modalities were mucositis, dermatitis, brain/bone necrosis, and visual/auditory abnormalities.This literature review suggests that PBT and CIRT are the preferred RT modality for ACC treatment with excellent LC rates and acceptable toxicity profiles in the adjuvant and definitive setting.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40883166,Treatment Patterns and Outcomes of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with High PD-L1 Expression using Real World Evidence.,"This study analyzed the comparative effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy versus ICI+chemotherapy (CIT) in the first-line (1L) setting among metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) patients with ≥ 50% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) alterations.Patients were identified from COTA's real-world (rw) database meeting the criteria: aged ≥ 18 years at diagnosis with mNSCLC on or after January 1, 2017, ≥ 50% PD-L1 expression, negative for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations, and received 1L ICI monotherapy or CIT. Characteristics and treatment patterns were summarized overall and by treatment group. Rw time to next treatment (rwTTNT), progression-free survival (rwPFS), and overall survival (rwOS) were summarized using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to balance baseline characteristics for adjusted analyses.Of 311 patients, 178 received ICI monotherapy and 133 received CIT. Adjusted median rwTTNT was 11.31 months for the CIT group compared to 7.63 for the ICI group (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.93). Adjusted rwPFS for the CIT group vs. ICI group was 8.78 and 5.56 months, respectively (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.11), and adjusted median rwOS for CIT and ICI was 23.08 and 20.28 months, respectively (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.18).Although adjusted rwTTNT differed by treatment group, this did not translate to a significant difference in survival.

40915545,Cerebrovascular protective functions of amyloid precursor protein: Progress and therapeutic prospects.,"Under physiological conditions, amyloid precursor protein (APP) is critically important for normal brain development, neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and synaptic signaling. Dyshomeostasis of APP increases deposition and accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels thereby leading to development of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In this review, we critically examine existing literature supporting the concept that endothelial APP performs important vascular protective functions in the brain. Studies in cultured human brain microvascular endothelium and cerebral arteries derived from genetically modified mice indicate that loss of APP impairs expression and function of Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) thereby causing endothelial dysfunction. Congruency between the findings obtained in murine and human cerebrovascular endothelium is consistent with strong evolutionary conservation of APP, and reinforces the concept that APP is an important vascular protective protein. Furthermore, we highlight vascular protective effects of APP during aging. We also address the roles of endothelial prostacyclin and nitric oxide in control of expression and proteolytic cleavage of APP. Finally, we outline potential translational opportunities emerging from recent advances in understanding of cerebrovascular function of APP. Several pharmacologically active domains of APP have been identified thus providing templates for creation of novel peptides with therapeutic properties.Copyright © 2024.

We describe AF preceding myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) ON.We retrospectively reviewed our MOGAD cohort (July 2024-April 2024). Inclusion criteria were (1) AF-defined as transient visual loss <24 hours without retinal ischemic lesions-before first ON and (2) fulfilled international MOGAD 2023 diagnostic criteria. Demographics, symptoms/signs, MRI, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data were collected. Descriptive statistics summarized the findings.In total, 8 of 350 (2.3%) MOGAD patients with ON experienced AF. Most patients (7/8, 87.5%) were women, and all reported periocular pain. Transient visual episodes were typically brief (median, 15 minutes; range, 1-300 minutes) and usually less than 1 hour (6/8, 75.0%). Amaurosis fugax affected the right (n = 4), left (n = 3), or both (n = 1) eyes. Within 1 week, 7 developed ON. MRI showed optic nerve enhancement in involved eye in 8 of 8 (100%).

40974616,Remimazolam use in obstetric patients: a single-center retrospective study (2021-2024).,"Remimazolam is an ultra-short-acting intravenous benzodiazepine approved for procedural sedation and general anaesthesia. Its favourable pharmacokinetic profile, including rapid onset, short context-sensitive half-time, and minimal cardiovascular depression, makes it a potential agent for obstetric anaesthesia, where maternal stability and fetal safety are paramount.This scoping review evaluates the pharmacologic profile, clinical applications, safety considerations, and emerging evidence for the use of remimazolam in obstetric settings. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Ovid databases (inception to April 1, 2025), for English-language manuscripts related to remimazolam use in obstetric contexts. Search terms included remimazolam during labour analgesia, caesarean delivery, termination of pregnancy, and procedural sedation during obstetric care. No restrictions were placed on study design or manuscript type; however, grey literature and non-peer-reviewed sources were excluded.The existing literature on remimazolam in obstetric anaesthesia consists primarily of case reports (n=), case series (n=) and randomised control trials (n=). These suggest that remimazolam may be safely used in high-risk obstetric populations including those with maternal cardiac disease, providing effective sedation, stable haemodynamic, high patient satisfaction and favourable maternal-fetal outcomes. The availability of flumazenil as a reversal agent adds a safety margin.While preliminary findings are encouraging, the current evidence is limited by the small cohorts evaluated in studies. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate its efficacy, confirm maternal and neonatal safety, address fluid compatibility concerns, and support guideline development for obstetric use.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

40972147,Unsupervised machine learning identifies clinically relevant patterns of CSF dynamic dysfunction in normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a common and debilitating condition whose diagnosis is made challenging due to the unspecific and common clinical presentation. The aim of our study was to determine if data driven patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) distribution can be used to predict iNPH diagnosis and response to treatment.We established a cohort of iNPH patients and age/sex-matched controls. We used Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on CSF probability maps from segmentation of T1-weighted MRI to obtain patterns or components of CSF distribution across participants and a load on each component in each participant. Visual assessment of morphologic phenotype was performed by a neuroradiologist, and clinical symptom improvement was assessed via retrospective chart review. We used the NMF component loads to predict diagnosis and clinical outcome after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for treatment of iNPH. Similar models were developed using manual Evan's index and callosal angle measurements.We included 98 iNPH patients and 98 controls split into test (20 %) and train (80 %) sets. The optimal NMF decomposition identified 7 patterns of CSF distribution in our cohort. Accuracy for predicting a clinical diagnosis of iNPH using the automated NMF model was 96 %/97 % in the train/test sets, which was similar to the performance of the manual measure models (92 %/97 %). Visualizing the voxels that contributed most to the NMF models revealed that the voxels most associated with a disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH) were the ones with higher probability of iNPH diagnosis. Neither NMF nor manual metrics performed well for prediction of qualitative clinical outcomes.NMF-generated patterns of CSF distribution showed high accuracy in discerning individuals with iNPH from controls. The patterns most relying on DESH features showed highest potential for independently predicting NPH diagnosis. The algorithm we proposed should not be perceived as a replacement for human expertise but rather as an additional tool to assist clinicians in achieving accurate diagnoses.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40966714,Platelet-Rich Plasma for Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause in Breast Cancer Survivors.,"To assess the safety and feasibility of injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the vagina and posterior fourchette and to evaluate 6-month efficacy for treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in breast cancer survivors.We conducted a prospective, single-arm pilot study of breast cancer survivors (stage 0-III) who reported vaginal dryness with or without dyspareunia. Participants underwent a one-time treatment with 7 mL autologous PRP injected throughout the vaginal canal and posterior fourchette into 35 sites. The primary outcome was to assess safety and feasibility. Secondary outcomes included VMI (Vaginal Maturation Index), VHI (Vaginal Health Index), VAS/VuAS (Vaginal and Vulvar Assessment Scales), DIVA (Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire), FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index), and UDI-6 (Urogenital Distress Inventory-Short Form) scores. Vaginal caliber was measured with silicone dilators. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was assessed with a 7-point Likert scale.Twenty participants were treated; mean±SD age and body mass index (BMI) were 53.6±7.5 years and 27.2±4.6, respectively. Most had hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (85.0%), and of those, 65.0% were taking an aromatase inhibitor. All participants completed the planned protocol. Treatment adverse events included vaginal spotting, irritation, discharge, burning, cramping, and mild pain, all resolving within 24 hours. No serious adverse events occurred. VAS/VuAS, FSFI, UDI-6, DIVA, VHI, and total scores showed significant improvement from baseline to 6 months; the VMI change was nonsignificant. At 6 months, 90.0% of patients had an increase in vaginal caliber as measured by change in dilator size, and 95.0% noted improvement of symptoms on PGI-I.A single treatment of autologous PRP injected diffusely through the vaginal canal and posterior fourchette is safe and feasible. In this uncontrolled pilot trial, at 6 months, treatment significantly improved GSM symptoms, sexual function, urinary symptoms, and quality of life in breast cancer survivors, including those on aromatase inhibitors.ClnicalTrials.gov , NCT04535323; Cancer.gov , NCT04535323.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.

40966481,Primary Results From Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1702: Clinical Transplant-Related Long-Term Outcomes of Alternative Donor Allogeneic Transplantation.,"The likelihood of finding a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor (MUD) for hematopoietic cell transplantation can be predicted using a donor search prognosis score. Patients without a MUD may use alternative donors (haploidentical related, mismatched unrelated, or umbilical cord blood).This multicenter biological assignment trial was conducted by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN 1702). Eligibility criteria were broad to mirror clinical practice. The primary end point was 2-year survival from evaluability and compared between those Very Likely (>90%) and Very Unlikely (<10%) to find a MUD. All other patients, Less Likely to find a MUD, were enrolled in an observational arm. Transplant outcomes were compared for all three groups.A total of 1,751 evaluable patients at 47 centers were Very Likely (54.7%), Less Likely (29.5%), and Very Unlikely (15.8%) to identify a MUD. Survival did not differ in univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.21]; P = .98) or multivariate (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.33]; P = .56) analyses between the Very Unlikely and Very Likely groups, measured through 2 years from the beginning of a search for a MUD or alternative donor. Of the transplanted patients (n = 1,179), MUD was used for 94% of the Very Likely, 38% of Less Likely, and 9% of Very Unlikely patients. Multivariate analyses showed no differences in relapse, treatment-related mortality, disease-free survival, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases for the three search prognosis groups after transplantation.Using a donor search prognosis strategy to prioritize an alternative donor for patients Very Unlikely to find a MUD resulted in survival and transplant outcomes that were not statistically different compared with those Very Likely to find a MUD.",J Clin Oncol,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Lee S J|Logan B|Horowitz M M|Dehn J G|Pidala J|Grunwald M R|Westervelt P|Farhadfar N|Hogan W J|Bashey A|Hayes-Lattin B|Hill L|Brunstein C|Arai S|Srour S A|Symons H|Uberti J|Vasu S|Pusic I|Juckett M|Leifer E|He N|Devine S|Shaw B E|Ciurea S O,Hogan W J,"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA.|Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|NMDP, Minneapolis, MN.|H.

40961542,Gastric neuroendocrine tumors arising from chronic proton pump inhibitor use: characteristics and outcomes of a fourth subtype.,"Gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are categorized into 3 types. Types I and II are indolent and are associated with hypergastrinemia. In contrast, Type III is sporadic and more aggressive and typically requires gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy. Widespread proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, which induces hypergastrinemia, has led to the proposal of a distinct fourth subtype. This study aimed to characterize this potential PPI-related Type IV gastric NET.A retrospective review was conducted of patients diagnosed as having gastric NETs from 2012 to 2022 at a single institution. Types I and II tumors were excluded. Patients with ≥1 year of PPI use were classified as having Type IV tumors, and the remainder were classified as having Type III. Clinical variables were compared using chi-square, Fisher's exact, or Mann-Whitney U test. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank testing was used for time-to-event outcomes.A total of 79 patients met the inclusion criteria: 34 (43.0%) with Type III and 45 (57.0%) with Type IV gastric NETs. Compared with Type III, Type IV tumors were significantly less likely to involve lymph nodes (0% vs 23.5%; P <.01) or present with distant metastases (4.4% vs 26.5%; P <.01). Recurrence patterns also differed: Type IV tumors exhibited only local recurrences, whereas Type III tumors had exclusively distant recurrences (P =.03). Type IV NETs demonstrated superior cancer-specific (P =.007) and progression-free survival (P =.037).Type IV gastric NETs in long-term PPI users seem to represent a distinct, indolent subtype. Their favorable outcomes may allow for nonsurgical management, although ongoing endoscopic surveillance and PPI discontinuation are critical owing to the frequent local recurrence.Copyright © 2025 Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

40924263,Cerebrovascular malformations different from AVMs in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a systematic review.,"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vascular formations across multiple organ systems, including the brain. While arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are well recognized in HHT, non-AVM cerebrovascular malformations remain underreported and poorly understood manifestations of the disease.A systematic review was conducted using multiple databases, applying a two-step screening process to exclude studies with insufficient, irrelevant, or incomplete data. Studies published between 1978 and 2024 were analyzed. The characteristics, clinical presentation, and frequency of non-AVM cerebrovascular malformations, including aneurysms and dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs), were assessed. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis model.A total of 1,639 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT were included from 22 studies. The pooled prevalence of non-AVM cerebrovascular malformations was as follows: dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) 1.2% (95% CI: 0.2-2.2%, p = 0.017, I²=85.89%), intracranial aneurysms (IAs) 3.3% (95% CI: 1.5-5.2%, p < 0.001, I²=88.68%), developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0-0.5%, p = 0.069, I²=0%), cavernous angiomas 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0-0.5%, p = 0.058, I²=0%), and capillary vascular malformations (CVMs) 0.4% (95% CI: - 0.1-0.9%, p = 0.078, I²=14.34%). Subgroup analysis showed higher IA prevalence in studies lacking systematic screening. Genotype data, when available, suggested ACVRL1 mutations were more common among patients with IAs, while ENG mutations were more frequently associated with brain AVMs and micro-AVMs.Non-AVM cerebrovascular malformations occur in HHT, with dAVFs showing the strongest association.

40920298,Targeting CD20 for B-cell Depletion in Autoimmune Kidney Disease: Next Generation.,"Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are gaining clinical relevance in the nephrology community due to their demonstrated efficacy and favorable safety profiles across short-, medium-, and long-term use. Initially developed for hematologic malignancies and multiple sclerosis, B-cell depletion therapies are now being investigated across a broader spectrum of autoimmune diseases, including glomerulopathies, both with and without associated podocytopathy. Recent advances have led to the development of novel anti-CD20 agents that are being used not only as potential alternatives to corticosteroids but also as adjunctive therapies in complex clinical settings. However, their efficacy is not uniform across all conditions, whether used for induction therapy, relapse management, or as rescue treatment following first-line therapy failure. A thorough understanding of their mechanisms of action, along with the potential for resistance and therapeutic failure, is essential for advancing precision medicine in this field. This review provides a molecular and clinical overview, incorporating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic insights into the most widely used and emerging anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in nephrology. It serves as a practical guide to understand how these agents' function, why they may fail, and what alternative strategies should be considered in cases of adverse reactions or inadequate response. Finally, it highlights their evolving role in precision therapy, both as monotherapy in podocytopathies and as part of a multi-targeted treatment approach for glomerular diseases with systemic involvement.© 2025.

40919481,Minimal residual disease measurement in blood by mass spectrometry identifies long-term responders in multiple myeloma.,"Modern multiple myeloma treatment enables deep and sustained responses, necessitating assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow to refine response categorization. Recently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods have emerged as highly sensitive tools for measuring MRD in the peripheral blood. However, the role specific MS techniques play in response categorization has yet to be established. We pooled data from 97 patients treated in 3 prospective phase 2 trials evaluating carfilzomib-based triplets and quadruplets, with or without autologous stem cell transplantation. MRD was assessed in the bone marrow using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and in the peripheral blood with 2 MS methods: matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (EXENT) and the more sensitive liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS). EXENT negativity was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. LC-MS negativity identified patients with long-term responses. EXENT complemented NGS MRD, with patients with double negativity experiencing longer PFS than those negative in only 1 modality. Patients negative by both LC-MS and NGS MRD at 10-6 had a 5-year PFS rate of 89%. These findings support incorporating MS into MRD response assessment and in prognostic algorithms in myeloma. In addition, our results indicate that LC-MS can provide valuable end point in future studies aiming for functional cure.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40919483,"Tagraxofusp, a CD123-targeted therapy, for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: final results of a phase 1/2 study.","Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive hematologic neoplasm characterized by an expansion of CD123+ monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). pDC bone marrow clusters in CMML have been associated with higher rates of acute myeloid leukemia transformation. We evaluated tagraxofusp, a CD123-targeted therapy, in a phase 1/2 trial for patients with CMML. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. At the recommended phase 2 dose of 12 μg/kg per day, 37 patients were treated: 15 were treatment naïve; 22 had relapsed/refractory disease (median number of previous therapies, 1 [range, 1-7]). Common nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) included fatigue (49%), hypoalbuminemia (46%), nausea, hypokalemia, and decreased appetite (44% each). Capillary leak syndrome occurred in 9 patients (23%; grade 3-4, 13%), whereas tumor lysis syndrome was seen in 13%. Hematologic grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs included thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (13%), leukocytosis (15%), and neutropenia (13%). No complete or partial responses were observed. One patient each in the treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory groups achieved complete cytogenetic remission with marrow response. Stable disease and clinical benefit were achieved by 40% and 27% of treatment-naïve patients and by 59% and 23% of relapsed/refractory patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 43.7 months, overall survival was 11.2 months in treatment-naïve and 15.6 months in relapsed/refractory patients. Exploratory analysis showed stable CD123+ blast frequency, mutational variant allele frequencies, and monocyte subsets with treatment.

40907831,"Pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma): Clinico-radiologic features, diagnosis, and outcomes.","Pulmonary marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALToma) is the most common form of primary pulmonary lymphoma. Data on clinic-radiologic presentation, diagnostic methods, and clinical outcome are relatively sparse.Retrospective study of 71 patients with biopsy-proven pulmonary MALToma encountered at Mayo Clinic from 1998 to 2022.Median age was 63 years (range: 41-87) and included 42 females (59 %). Most patients (60.6 %) were asymptomatic; most common symptoms were cough (23.9 %), dyspnea (19.7 %), chest pain (5.6 %) and fatigue (5.6 %). Predisposing systemic disorder was present in 23 (32.4 %) patients, most commonly primary Sjogren syndrome (19.7 %). Diagnosis was achieved by surgical lung biopsy, core needle biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, and fine needle aspirate in 42 (60 %), 21 (29.6 %), 7 (10 %), 1 (1.4 %) patient, respectively; diagnostic rates were 100 %, 72.4 %, 41.2 % and 33 %, respectively. On chest CT scan, the most common type of abnormality was consolidation in 62 (87 %) and nodular/mass-like lesions in 62 (87 %) cases; air-bronchogram was present in 50 (70.4 %) cases. These findings were multilobar and bilateral in 45 (63.4 %) and 43 (60.6 %) cases, respectively, with no predominant distribution. Over one-third did not need treatment and pulmonary MALToma was an uncommon cause of death.Pulmonary MALToma most commonly manifests during the 7th decade of life with more than half of patients being asymptomatic at presentation. Most frequent imaging findings include bilateral areas of consolidation and/or nodular/mass-like lesions commonly associated with air-bronchogram.

40899793,Triple A Plus (AAA +) Survival Prediction Model for Essential Thrombocythemia: Analysis Involving 7308 Patients.,"Survival prediction models in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSET) and the more recently introduced triple-A (AAA) prognostic score. The latter enlists age and absolute neutrophil (ANC) and lymphocyte (ALC) counts as risk variables. In the current study, a Mayo Clinic discovery cohort of 658 patients with ET was used to identify AAA-independent risk variables. Accordingly, multivariable analysis-derived HRs (95% CI) were 15.7 (8.4-29.5) for age > 70 years (8 points); 4.2 (2.3-7.5) for age 50 to 70 years (2 points); 1.8 (1.2-2.5) for ANC ≥ 8 × 109/L (1 point); 1.4 (1.03-1.9) for ALC < 1.7 × 109/L (1 point); 1.8 (1.2-2.6) for absolute monocyte count (AMC) ≥ 0.5 × 109/L (1 point); 1.8 (1.2-2.3) for male sex (1 point); 1.8 (1.3-2.4) for arterial hypertension (1 point); and 1.6 (1.2-2.3) for arterial thrombosis (1 point). HR-weighted scoring enabled a 4-tiered risk classification: ultra-low (0-1 points; N = 94; median survival 42.7 years), low (2-4 points; N = 297; 23 years), intermediate (5 points; N = 66; 17.3 years), and high (6-14 points; N = 201; 10.8 years). Time-dependent predictive performance at 20/25 years favored AAA+ (AUC 0.92/0.91) vs. AAA (0.86/0.86) vs. IPSET (0.81/0.84). The AAA+ risk model was subsequently validated by two external cohorts from Israel (N = 5968) and Italy (N = 682). In the cohort from Israel, disease-specific mortality was assessed by comparing observed survival to an age- and sex-matched reference population, which suggested near-normal life expectancy in ultra-low risk patients. The current study highlights host-related factors as the primary determinants of longevity in ET and provides a composite risk score (AAA+) that is based on complete blood count-derived parameters and host-related factors. Predictive performance of the new model was shown to be superior to that of IPSET and AAA.© 2025 The Author(s).

40887794,Reassessing the Risk of Esophageal Cancer in Achalasia Post-Therapy: Findings From a Large United States Multi-Centre Retrospective Propensity-Matched Cohort Study.,"Achalasia is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer; though reported incidence rates vary widely (0.4% to 9.2%) due to differences in demographics, follow-up duration, and diagnostic methods. This study evaluates the risk of esophageal cancer and Barrett's esophagus (BE) in achalasia using a large national database and a propensity-matched control cohort.Achalasia patients were identified utilizing the TriNetX database based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for diagnostic procedures and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) directed therapies, including Heller myotomy, peroral endoscopic myotomy, and pneumatic dilation. A matched control group of celiac disease patients was used. A 1-year lead time was applied to exclude secondary malignant achalasia. Outcomes included the incidence of esophageal cancer and BE, with subgroup analysis in patients following therapy.Among 7863 achalasia patients (mean age 58.0, 51.9% female), the esophageal cancer risk was significantly higher than control (risk ratio 2.87, 95% CI: 1.56-5.27, p < 0.001). The absolute risk was low, with 40 cases (0.51%) over a mean follow-up of 3.18 years. BE risk was also higher in achalasia (risk ratio 1.54, 95% CI: 1.24-1.90, p < 0.001), with 220 cases (2.80%). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in BE risk between POEM and Heller myotomy (risk ratio 1.0, 95% CI: 0.42-2.40, p > 0.99).The elevated cancer risk in achalasia over a short follow-up period warrants reconsideration of current endoscopic surveillance guidelines, despite the low absolute risk of esophageal cancer and BE.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,"Nov, 2025",2025,Nov,,Perananthan V|Mohammed M F|Beran A|Hamid O|Codipilly D C|Snyder D L|Leggett C|Alexander J A|Vela M|Ravi K,Perananthan V|Mohammed M F|Codipilly D C|Snyder D L|Leggett C|Alexander J A|Vela M|Ravi K,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.","Perananthan V, Mohammed M F, Beran A, Hamid O, Codipilly D C, Snyder D L, Leggett C, Alexander J A, Vela M, Ravi K",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40887794/,"This study found that people with achalasia, a condition that affects the esophagus, have a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer and Barrett's esophagus compared to the general population.

40889163,The clinical utility of assessing coronary vasomotor dysfunction in angina with nonobstructive coronary artery.,"This paper reviews the current understanding of coronary vascular dysfunction (CVDys) in patients with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease (ANOCA), based on recent findings from a comprehensive, large-scale study. It also discusses potential future directions for research and clinical practice.CVDys involves enhanced vasoconstriction or impaired vasodilation caused by endothelium-dependent and/or -independent dysfunction in the epicardial or microvascular coronary arteries. It is classified into four subtypes based on anatomical location and underlying mechanisms, and can be assessed using coronary reactivity testing (CRT). Previous studies have evaluated their prognostic implications separately or in limited populations.A recent study assessed all subtypes within a single ANOCA cohort and confirmed that endothelium-dependent epicardial dysfunction and both types of microvascular dysfunction are associated with worse prognosis. Moreover, it demonstrated that microvascular function - both endothelium-dependent and -independent - serves as an independent prognostic factor for major adverse cardiovascular events. These findings emphasize the value of CRT-based comprehensive evaluation for risk stratification.While evidence regarding the prognostic impact of CVDys has become increasingly robust, effective treatment strategies remain undefined. Future efforts should focus on developing CRT-guided interventions targeting coronary dysfunction, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40895774,Reirradiation clinical practice in gastrointestinal abdominal malignancies: an international reirradiation collaborative group (ReCOG) systematic review.,"Reirradiation in abdominal malignancies has grown more common with advanced radiotherapy techniques. However, clinical use and implementation varies, and there remains limited consensus on best practices for reirradiation. In this systematic review, a multidisciplinary team treating gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary malignancies within the Reirradiation Collaborative Group (ReCOG) convened to review published literature on reirradiation in the abdomen to offer insights into patient selection, radiotherapy planning, risk management, and assessing knowledge gaps for future development of guidelines.A systematic search of Cochrane Central, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and PubMed up to August 30, 2024, was conducted as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Data on patient characteristics, radiation doses, dose constraints, treatment outcomes, and toxicities were extracted. Where feasible, pooled weighted analyses were performed.Thirty-three studies involving 1,264 patients met inclusion criteria: 30 were retrospective and 3 prospective. The median number of patients reported per study was 26 (range 2-245). Of the reported tumor sites, 718 patients had liver tumors and 277 pancreas, with smaller numbers of mixed/lymph node targets. Reirradiation doses, fractionation schemes, and dose constraints varied widely; only half of the studies provided explicit organ-at-risk constraints. Three studies included patients treated with palliative intent. Median overall survival ranged from 5.9 to 44 months, with a pooled weighted median OS of 19.6 months across 20 studies that reported it. One-year local control rates ranged from 19 % to 93 %, with severe (grade ≥ 3) toxicities typically reported in 5-15 % of patients, although one study reported 25 % lethal RILD in liver reirradiation.Reirradiation in abdominal malignancies appears to be able to achieve meaningful local control and survival in select patients, though heterogeneity in planning, dosing, and toxicity reporting remains a major challenge for establishing best practices. Standardized reporting of doses, constraints, and dose-volume relationships are needed to guide safe and effective reirradiation in this setting.© 2025 The Authors.

40889636,Downstaged lateral pelvic lymph nodes require no resection after neoadjuvant therapy and total mesorectal excision.,"This study evaluated lateral lymph node (LLN) downstaging on restaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its impact on local recurrence (LR) in patients with stage 3 rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy followed by curative surgery.This was a retrospective review of adult patients with stage 3 rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by curative surgery between 2014 and 2023 at a high-volume center. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on LLN status: patients with negative LLN on baseline MRI (group 1) and patients with positive LLN on baseline MRI, which downstaged to negative on restaging MRI (group 2).A total of 397 patients (group 1, 310; group 2, 87) underwent curative surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer. There were no significant differences between both groups regarding age, sex, body mass index, mesorectal fascia involvement, and clinical T stage. However, a significantly lower proportion of group 1 patients received total neoadjuvant therapy as neoadjuvant treatment than group 2 patients (43.5% vs 62.1%; P =.002). Group 2 had a significantly higher proportion of LLN dissection (LLND) (2.9% vs 17.2%; P <.001). However, all the surgically removed LLNs were negative for tumors. At 5-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that there was no significant difference between both groups in LR rate (2.3% vs 4.6%; P =.21), LLN recurrence rate (0.6% vs 1.1%; P =.61), and disease-free survival (83.9% vs 86.2%; P =.61).Observation rather than LLND may be appropriate for patients with downstaged LLNs based on restaging MRI findings after neoadjuvant therapy.Copyright © 2025 Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

41170705,Efficacy comparison of combined montelukast-antihistamine and montelukast monotherapy in allergic rhinitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Background.Combination therapy with montelukast and oral antihistamines is commonly used in allergic rhinitis (AR), but its comparative benefit over montelukast monotherapy remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy compared to monotherapy, with a focus on symptom-specific outcomes. Methods. A comprehensive search of PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was conducted through April 2025. We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials comparing montelukast combined with oral antihistamines to montelukast monotherapy in patients with AR. Outcomes included total symptom scores, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scores, and individual symptom domains. Pooled effects were analyzed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. Thirteen RCTs enrolling 2,950 patients were identified. Combination therapy significantly improved daytime symptoms (SMD = 0.25; 95%CI 0.15 to 0.35), with limited benefit for nighttime symptoms (SMD = 0.10; 95%CI -0.01 to 0.21) or RQLQ scores (SMD = 0.11; 95%CI -0.05 to 0.26). In subgroup analysis, all combinations with loratadine, desloratadine, or levocetirizine showed greater efficacy than monotherapy in improving daytime symptoms. However, only the levocetirizine-based combination demonstrated a significant benefit for nighttime symptoms. When analyzed by individual symptoms, the levocetirizine combination resulted in significantly better outcomes than monotherapy, improving sneezing, nasal itching, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea.

41171217,Ten Reasons Why Prospective Randomized Studies in Surgery Are Flawed and Fundamentally Different From Drug Trials.,"Prospective randomized controlled trials are widely regarded as the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions. Although this model is appropriate for drug development, its application in surgical research has proven challenging and, in many cases, misleading. Surgery involves complex interactions between technical skill, patient variability, and intraoperative decision-making that cannot be easily standardized or controlled. This article outlines 10 reasons why prospective randomized studies in surgery are fundamentally different from drug trials, highlighting methodological, ethical, and practical concerns. Recognizing these distinctions is critical to developing more appropriate and context-sensitive research frameworks for surgical evaluation.Copyright © 2025 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

41171584,Psychomotor skill transfer between non-patient and patient training: a point-of-care ultrasound use case.,"While it's commonplace in medical education to train learners using simulated patient encounters, task trainers, or by practicing skills on healthy volunteers, little is known about how well learning and skills transfer to patient care. The purpose of this research is to quantify Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) skill transfer to patient care through performance assessment. A quantitative analysis of aggregated data consisting of image quality of student-performed POCUS examinations from one midwestern Physician Assistant program was performed. Probabilities for scores of 1-2, 3, 4, and 5 were estimated using a multivariable cumulative logit model. Forty-six PA students were included in the study. A total of 6,218 POCUS examinations were included; 4,506 on non-patients, and 1,712 on patients. When evaluating skill transfer from non-patients to patients, the probability of obtaining a high-quality examination decreases significantly, with a more substantial decrease in performance on more complex skills. The probability of a high-quality examination on the twenty-fifth examination was the highest when learning transfer happened earlier. While training medical providers using non-patient experiences is common, educators must understand the significant loss of quality upon skills transfer to patient care. More complex or higher risk skills likely require close monitoring at the point of skill transfer, to support the learner and ensure patient safety. Based on the findings of this research, earlier skill transfer is associated with worse immediate performance but better long-term re-learning outcomes. Increased deliberate practice prior to skill transfer is associated with better first-time performance on actual patients.© 2025.

41169252,Objective Assessments and Annotation Frameworks in Microscopic Surgery: A Scoping Review.,"Microscopic surgery assessment tools vary in objectivity and requirements for determining surgical proficiency. Artificial intelligence methods for objective microsurgical analysis have become more common, but their applications to mastoidectomy have not been reconciled with earlier efforts. This scoping review aimed to (1) compile and compare objective features and assessment targets of microscopic surgery analysis tools and (2) inform the development of a standardized annotation framework for mastoidectomy.Ovid MEDLINE®, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid), and Scopus.A scoping review of English-language, full-text articles describing any objective analysis tool for microscopic surgery performed by participants of any level. Extracted data included procedure type, evaluation modality, and classification into five domains: checklist/rating-based, instrument motion analysis, error identification, workflow modeling, and artificial intelligence-assisted feedback.Of 2203 screened studies, 52 met the inclusion criteria across otolaryngology, ophthalmology, and neurological surgery. Manual assessments (n = 42, 80.8%) primarily used checklists, rating scales, or end-product evaluations. Automated assessments (n = 10, 19.2%) incorporated motion tracking and artificial intelligence-assisted feedback. Otolaryngology contributed 28 tools, 22 of which evaluated mastoidectomy, cochlear implantation, or temporal bone dissection. Virtual reality was the most commonly reported training platform (n = 13).Although instrument tracking and artificial intelligence-assisted feedback have been explored, evaluation of microscopic surgery remains largely manual and subjective, with limited adoption of automated assessment tools.

41171607,The Relentless Progression of Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease in Liver Transplantation in Spain.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is increasingly recognized as a significant indication for liver transplantation (LT) in North America. Yet data on its impact in other countries, such as Spain, remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and trajectory of MASLD-related LT in Spain and compare these findings with broader national data and international data sets.Multicenter retrospective cohort study including adults (18 y and older) undergoing LT for MASLD between 2010 and 2023 in 5 large Spanish centers. Additional data were obtained from the Spanish Transplant Registry (Organización Nacional de Trasplantes) and high-prevalence LT centers in the United States (n = 7) and Canada (n = 1).Among 3448 LTs performed in the 5 Spanish centers, 3.4% (n = 117) were MASLD-related. An increasing trajectory of MASLD-related LT was observed, with predictions suggesting a rise to 5.4%-10.8% of LTs for MASLD by 2028. These trends were consistent with Organización Nacional de Trasplantes data. Compared with North American data, the growth trajectory in Spain showed a less steep increase. Hepatocellular carcinoma rates were higher in the Spanish MASLD-LT recipients, yet metabolic comorbidities were frequent in all populations.The burden of MASLD-related LT in Spain is growing, yet at a less pronounced rate than in the United States/Canada. Whether this slower increase will persist or decline in the future as newer antiobesity and MASLD-related drugs are increasingly used is still unknown. In the meantime, our results highlight the need for tailored approaches to management and prevention in the Spanish population and underscore the importance of continued monitoring and research into the evolving impact of MASLD on LT in Spain and beyond.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Patients were divided into three groups: CD stage 0-2; CD stage 3-4, isolated AS (stage 3-4 CD without significant concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mitral annular calcification, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery or cardiac amyloidosis); CD stage 3-4, AS with comorbidities (stage 3-4 CD with ≥ 1 of these comorbidities). Futility was defined as death or stage 3-4 NYHA class dyspnea one year after TAVI.Of 985 included patients, 822 (83%) had stage 1-2 CD, 101 (10%) had CD stage 3-4, isolated AS and 62 (6%) had CD stage 3-4, AS with comorbidities. Futility was not more common in stage 3-4 CD groups (stage 1-2 CD: 10%, CD stage 3-4, isolated AS: 17%, CD stage 3-4, AS with comorbidities: 15%, p=0.09). Baseline and one-year NYHA class was higher in stage 3-4 CD compared to stage 1-2 CD (p<0.01). 6-minute walking test distance increased similarly in all groups at one year.Potential comorbidities contributing to right heart dysfunction were common among patients in stage 3-4 CD undergoing TAVI. Stage 3-4 CD was not associated with a significantly higher risk of futility, irrespective of comorbidities, and they experienced a similar functional improvement after TAVI.© The Author(s) 2025.

41172369,Herbert Mayo (1796-1852): a pioneering neuroanatomist's forgotten legacy.,"British anatomical physiology in the early 19th century evolved from the work of William Harvey, Thomas Willis, and William Hunter, who emphasized cerebral functional localization, integrating physiology and anatomy. This novel perspective was championed by Herbert Mayo (1796-1852). A student of Charles Bell at the Middlesex Hospital in London, Mayo subsequently became a surgeon there in 1818 and later a professor of anatomy and surgery. His experiments on the motor functions of the seventh cranial nerve and sensorimotor functions of the fifth cranial nerve brought him renown. Mayo, inspired by Johann Christian Reil, also conducted the first accurate brainstem dissections, developed innovative tissue preservation methods, and provided detailed descriptions of key fiber tracts. Mayo's 1822-1823 Anatomical and Physiological Commentaries and 1827 A Series of Engravings Intended to Illustrate the Structure of the Brain and Spinal Chord in Man accurately depicted the corona radiata, cerebellar peduncles, and uncinate fascicle. In his 1842 book, The Nervous System and Its Functions, Mayo discussed the localization of higher brain functions. His dissections remained unmatched until Josef Klingler's work in 1934. Despite the quality of his work, Mayo has been largely neglected, possibly because of his tumultuous relationship with Bell and later professional difficulties. Nevertheless, Mayo significantly contributed to white matter anatomy and led the search for cerebral localization, subsequently impacting neurosurgery.

41172372,Dual MAPK/VEGF inhibition for KRAS-mutated brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are rare but potentially devastating cerebrovascular lesions. Activating KRAS mutations are common in sporadic bAVMs, but their clinical implications remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel therapeutic strategy for hemorrhagic bAVMs based on dual inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways using an engineered mouse model with a titratable KRASG12V-GFP transgene.The AAV-BR1-CAG vector was used to deliver a KRASG12V-GFP transgene specifically to cerebral endothelial cells. Mice received 5 × 107 to 5 × 1010 genome copies of the vector, and bAVM formation, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and overall survival were assessed. Mice with established hemorrhagic bAVMs were subsequently treated with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) or RMC-7977 (RAS inhibitor), with or without an anti-mouse VEGF antibody, starting 4 weeks after viral delivery. Overall survival was assessed.Selective overexpression of KRASG12V-GFP in cerebral endothelial cells led to the formation of bAVMs in a dose-dependent manner. Mice that received the highest transgene dose developed significantly more bAVMs, exhibited a higher ICH burden, and had worse overall survival compared with those that received lower transgene doses. In mice receiving the highest transgene dose, trametinib alone modestly improved the median overall survival (8.4 weeks vs 6.4 weeks, p = 0.049), while single-agent RMC-7977 showed no significant benefit. Anti-VEGF therapy alone reduced survival (6.9 weeks vs 9.6 weeks, p = 0.044). However, combination therapy with trametinib or RMC-7977 and anti-VEGF antibody significantly prolonged survival, with the most pronounced benefit seen in the RMC-7977 plus anti-VEGF group (13.1 weeks vs 6.7 weeks in controls, p = 0.024).Our findings suggest that, in addition to promoting bAVM formation, KRAS mutations in cerebral endothelial cells might be causally implicated in bAVM rupture.

40669428,Symptom cluster profiles among community-residing older adults with heart failure: Findings from the U.S. health and retirement study.,"As people grow older, years of exposure to cardiovascular risk factors progressively damage the heart's structure and function, causing the incidence of heart failure (HF) to rise with age. Among older adults with HF, symptoms are manifested as clusters. Few studies have addressed symptoms specifically in older adults with HF, and most have been conducted with small samples.(1) describe symptom cluster profiles in older adults with HF in a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults, and (2) determine the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and membership in symptom cluster profiles.Data from the Health and Retirement Study were used for a secondary analysis. Fatigue, shortness of breath, pain, swelling, depressive symptoms, and dizziness were measured. Latent class analysis was used to identify symptom cluster profiles. Bivariate associations and multinomial logistic regression were used to determine the associations between symptom cluster profiles and demographic and clinical characteristics.The sample included 690 participants. Three symptom cluster profiles were identified [high-burden, low-burden, and cardiopulmonary-depressive]. Age, gender, BMI, marital status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, lung disease, and arthritis were significantly different across the three profiles.

40714714,Socioeconomic disparities in In-hospital outcomes and readmission rates among patients hospitalized with infective endocarditis: A national analysis from the United States.,"Contemporary data elucidates an association between adverse outcomes and low socioeconomic status (SES) in patients with cardiovascular related hospitalizations. Despite this, the impact of SES status on infective endocarditis (IE) outcomes remains unknown.To assess the impact of SES on hospitalized IE cases.We queried the Nationwide Readmission Database (2016-2020) to identify adult patients with IE and stratified them based on mean income quartiles (≤2 quartile vs. ≥3 quartiles). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day readmissions, sepsis, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) use, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker and valve replacement interventions, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges. Multivariable regression models adjusted for confounders.Among 41,175 IE hospitalizations, 24,581 (59.7 %) included patients with low income. Low income was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.04-1.41, p = 0.012), 30-day readmissions (aOR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.17, p = 0.021), 90-day readmissions (aOR 1.1, 95 % CI 1.02-1.19, p = 0.012), sepsis (aOR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.03-1.19, p = 0.008), MCS use (aOR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.04-2.09, p = 0.027) and lower odds of stroke (aOR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.78-0.96, p = 0.005) compared with high-income. No differences were observed in odds of AKI, valve replacement intervention, pacemaker use, mean LOS and total hospital charges between both income groups.Among IE hospitalizations, lower income was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality and non-fatal adverse outcomes compared to higher income individuals.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40789229,Perioperative antifibrotic therapy for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis undergoing lung cancer surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) undergoing lung cancer surgery face a 4.4-20 % risk of acute exacerbation (AE-IPF) with mortality exceeding 50 %. The potential role of perioperative antifibrotic therapy in reducing surgical complications in this high-risk population remains unclear.To evaluate whether perioperative antifibrotic therapy (pirfenidone/nintedanib) reduces complications, particularly acute exacerbations and mortality, in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery through systematic review and meta-analysis.Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining perioperative antifibrotic therapy in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Four studies comprising 261 patients (124 treated, 137 controls) from Japan and Italy (2016-2024) were analyzed. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using Review Manager 5.4. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42025649005).Perioperative antifibrotic therapy achieved a 69 % reduction in AE-IPF risk (RR 0.31, 95 % CI 0.13-0.70) and an 81 % reduction in 90-day mortality (RR 0.19, 95 % CI 0.07-0.52). Additional benefits included significantly shorter hospital stays (5 vs 7 days, p = 0.029) and reduced complications, including decreased prolonged air leak rates (3.4 % vs 26.9 %). Adverse events were minimal, consisting primarily of mild nausea and photosensitivity.Perioperative antifibrotic therapy significantly reduces acute exacerbations and mortality in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. However, findings are limited by small observational studies concentrated in specific geographic regions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy and establish standardized treatment protocols.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40999647,Lithium Toxicity and Altered Clearance Following Initiation of Semaglutide in Patients With Bipolar Disorder: A Case Series and Literature Review.,"Lithium is a mainstay treatment for bipolar disorder, but its narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to pharmacokinetic interactions make appropriate monitoring crucial. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide, are increasingly prescribed for type 2 diabetes and weight management. Scarce evidence exists on the potential interaction between semaglutide and lithium.We present 3 cases involving patients on stable lithium regimens who were initiated on semaglutide, reviewing potential mechanisms underlying the interaction between them.In 2 cases, lithium levels increased significantly, leading to toxicity despite stable renal function and no changes in concurrent medications. In the third case, preemptive reductions in lithium dosage mitigated toxicity, although lithium levels remained higher than anticipated. Mechanistic hypotheses that might contribute to semaglutide-associated elevated lithium levels include altered kidney function, dehydration from reduced oral intake, vomiting, or diarrhea, and delayed gastric emptying.To our knowledge, this is one of the first documented case series describing a potential interaction between semaglutide and lithium in the medical literature. These cases underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring when combining lithium with semaglutide, and potentially other GLP-1 RAs. Baseline renal function, hydration status, and lithium levels should be assessed before initiating semaglutide, and lithium levels should be monitored more frequently during therapy. Clinicians prescribing semaglutide to patients on lithium should exercise caution, monitor for signs of toxicity, and provide appropriate patient education. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this potential interaction and its clinical significance.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
