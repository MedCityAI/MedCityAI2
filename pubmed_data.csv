41183370,Bridging the Physician Knowledge Gap in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Breast Imaging Care.,"Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face unique challenges in accessing affirming, evidence-based breast imaging care because of longstanding disparities in provider education, institutional practices, and imaging guidelines. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, such as chest masculinization or breast augmentation, impact breast tissue composition and cancer risk, necessitating individualized imaging approaches. Through multiple clinical vignettes, this article illustrates potential pitfalls and key considerations in breast imaging for TGD patients, including appropriate imaging recommendations, inclusive system-level changes, and navigating patient encounters. Education of breast imaging radiologists, technologists, and front-desk staff is critical to bridge the known knowledge gap and improve outcomes for this patient population. By adopting inclusive, culturally competent, and trauma-informed practices, breast imaging professionals can help reduce disparities and improve the experience and health outcomes of TGD patients.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.

41387682,USP29 and SMURF1 orchestrate FSP1-mediated ferroptosis suppression to facilitate chemoresistance in gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Chemoresistance poses a major obstacle to successful treatment for GC patients. Here, we demonstrate that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) enables chemoresistance in GC by inhibiting ferroptosis, resulting in diminished chemotherapy response and reduced patient survival rate. USP29 and SMURF1 are subsequently discovered as the deubiquitinase and E3 ligase of FSP1, respectively, orchestrating the ubiquitination of FSP1 to modulate ferroptosis and chemoresistance in GC. In the ubiquitination process, SMURF1 is observed to interact with and polyubiquitinate FSP1 within K63/K193 sites. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of FSP1 by iFSP1 is shown to synergize with chemotherapeutic agents across chemoresistant cellular and mouse models. Our findings thus underscore the pivotal role of the USP29 and SMURF1 in regulating GC chemoresistance via FSP1-mediated ferroptosis suppression. FSP1 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic avenue to overcome chemoresistance in GC.© 2025.

The patient, a 39-year-old woman, presented with symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy and has had ablation, medical management, and a pacemaker placed because of arrythmias.Most LMNA disorders are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, with rare autosomal-recessive laminopathies mainly involving neuromuscular phenotypes. Laminopathies that have involved cardiomyopathies have all been reported to be autosomal dominant.To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an autosomal-recessive laminopathy with primary dilated cardiomyopathy.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41384982,A numerical framework for preprocedural prosthetic valve positioning and hemodynamic evaluation.,"Aortic valve replacement is a cornerstone treatment for severe aortic valve diseases, including stenosis and regurgitation. Suboptimal valve seating can elevate the transvalvular pressure gradient, while valve orientation and size may produce flow jets that impinge on the ascending aorta, potentially weakening the vessel wall. Such hemodynamic complications can compromise valve performance and patient outcomes. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics framework, derived from medical CT images, for preprocedural hemodynamic assessment of aortic valve replacement. The framework minimizes user input and delivers rapid results, enabling efficient evaluation of valve types, orientations, and their hemodynamic impact. The results demonstrate that non-optimal implantation angles substantially increase pressure drop across the valve, thereby imposing higher workload on the heart. This automated and efficient simulation framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical application, supporting precise planning and execution of valve implantation procedures to improve patient care.© 2025.

41385031,"Calf Strains in Athletes: A Narrative Review of Management, Injury Grading, and Return to Sport.","Calf strains are common in sports like football, rugby, and tennis, with high recurrence rates during competition. Despite their frequency, there are no universally accepted guidelines for managing these injuries based on grading systems or imaging modalities. This review aims to evaluate the role of imaging and injury grading in predicting return to sport following a calf strain.A systematic search was conducted to assess the role of imaging and grading in predicting return to sport in athletes with calf strains. A search of Scopus and PubMed in June 2024 identified relevant studies using terms related to calf strains, imaging, and return to sport. Eligible studies involved human participants, used imaging for diagnosing or grading calf injuries, and assessed return to play outcomes. Studies were excluded if they involved animals, lacked imaging, or did not report relevant outcomes. The screening was done by a team of investigators based on predefined criteria.The review identified that imaging, particularly ultrasound and MRI, offers valuable information for grading calf strains and predicting recovery timelines. Different grading systems correlated with clinical outcomes, but no single modality or grading system was universally superior. Clinical assessments remained essential in return to play decisions.Imaging modalities, along with injury grading, provide useful insights into calf strain severity and recovery. However, these tools should complement clinical assessments, which are the gold standard for return to sport decisions. An integrative approach combining imaging and clinical evaluation is recommended to optimize return to sport protocols. Further standardization of grading systems and imaging protocols may improve prediction accuracy and treatment outcomes for calf strains.© 2025.

41385299,Emerging Therapies in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder and a leading monogenic cause of kidney failure. Reduction or loss of polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2) function disrupts ciliary calcium signaling, elevates cyclic AMP (cAMP), reprograms cellular metabolism, and activates proliferative cascades that drive cyst expansion. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, established cAMP modulation as a disease-modifying strategy but is limited by aquaretic effects and hepatotoxicity risk. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies in clinical trial development that extend beyond vasopressin antagonism. Gene-directed therapies aim to restore polycystin dosage, including anti-miR-17 oligonucleotides (e.g., farabursen) and pharmacochaperones that rescue misfolded PC1 and restore trafficking in select PKD1 missense variants (e.g., VX-407). Paracrine signaling can be modulated with anti-pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) antibodies that reduce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) bioavailability in cystic microenvironments. Metabolic reprogramming is targeted by agents such as metformin, bempedoic acid, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and structured dietary interventions. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors hold theoretical promise but await definitive results from ongoing trials. A novel cAMP-lowering strategy via phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) activation is advancing toward clinical testing. Looking ahead, gene therapy and genome editing offer the potential to raise polycystin levels above the threshold for cystogenesis, although challenges in vector capacity, kidney-specific delivery, and durability remain. Artificial intelligence (AI)-guided discovery, coupled with human organoid platforms, is accelerating therapeutic repurposing and rational combination design. Collectively, these advances signal a transition toward a layered, mechanism-guided framework in which vasopressin blockade is integrated with metabolic, other signaling, and genotype-specific therapies. As biomarkers and risk stratification tools mature, ADPKD management is poised to become increasingly precise, tolerable, and effective.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Given frequent estrogen receptor (ER) expression and dysregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)-p16-Rb pathway, features shared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, dual endocrine, and CDK4/6 inhibition is a biologically rational strategy. This phase II trial evaluated ribociclib plus letrozole in recurrent LGSOC.This open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II study enrolled women with measurable, recurrent LGSOC. Patients received ribociclib (600 mg orally, once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) and letrozole (2.5 mg orally, once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary end points included clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.Of 74 patients screened, 51 were enrolled and 49 treated. The confirmed ORR was 30.6% (90% CI, 19.9 to 43.2), including one complete and 14 partial responses. Among responders, the median duration of response was 21.2 months. The CBR was 84% (90% CI, 72.5 to 91.6). The median PFS was 14.5 months (90% CI, 10.1 to 28.8), and the median OS was 44.5 months (90% CI, 31.8 to not reached). The most common grade ≥3 adverse event (AE) was neutropenia (47%), managed with dose modifications. Three grade 5 events (6%) occurred but were unrelated to treatment. Treatment discontinuation because of AEs occurred in 4%. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed.Ribociclib plus letrozole met the primary end point, achieving meaningful response rates and durable disease control in recurrent LGSOC.

41386268,International development and validation of a multilingual bank of items for the self-assessment of essential knowledge by systemic lupus erythematosus patients: the SLE Knowledge Assessment score (SLAKE).,"Patient education is increasingly acknowledged as an important aspect of the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of the study was to develop the SLE Knowledge Assessment score (SLAKE), a digital multilingual self-assessment tool designed to quantify essential SLE knowledge.International healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patient representatives engaged in a multi-step process to: identify essential SLE knowledge domains, select key domains via rating, and generate an item bank of 394 questions across 11 domains, which was then adapted into 19 languages. For validation, participants completed 44 questions (including 33 randomly selected), with scores calculated for total knowledge and the 11 specific domains. Statistical analyses examined associations between scores and demographic, clinical, and educational variables.SLAKE was used by 1182 SLE participants (1120 [94.8%] women, median age: 45 years [IQR: 35-54 years]), with a median SLE duration of 10 years (IQR: 4-20 years). The median SLAKE score was 37 (IQR: 34-40) of a maximum of 44 points while the median score across the 11 SLAKE domains ranged between 3 and 4 over a maximum of 4 points. There was a significant positive association between SLAKE score and SLE duration (p= 0.006), previous participation to a patient education course or a patient training for lupus (p< 0.0001) and the education level (p< 0.0001) but not with age (p= 0.48) or gender (p= 0.39).SLAKE is a valid, multilingual, digital self-assessment tool that effectively measures essential SLE knowledge. Its randomized question bank and domain-specific scoring enable targeted education, ultimately supporting better disease management.© The Author(s) 2025.

41386743,Long-term outcomes in seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the cumulative incidence of diagnosis switching, drug-free remission, and initiation of a biologic or targeted synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD) in individuals with seronegative RA.Adult residents of Olmsted County, MN with incident seronegative (rheumatoid factor-/anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody-) RA meeting the 1987 and/or 2010 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were included. Data were collected from 1/1/2005-12/31/2023 through manual chart review. Drug-free remission was defined as a period of ≥6 months where the individual was no longer on treatment for RA and did not have evidence of active inflammatory arthritis on evaluation by a rheumatologist. We calculated the 10-year cumulative incidence of a change in diagnosis, adjusting for the competing risk of death, and of drug-free remission and initiation of a b/tsDMARD, adjusting for the competing risks of death or change in diagnosis.A total of 176 individuals with seronegative RA (68% female) were included. The 10-year cumulative incidence of a change in diagnosis was 12.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-18.9%). The most common change in diagnosis was to a spondyloarthritis (4%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of drug-free remission and initiation of a b/tsDMARD was 26.6% (95% CI: 20.7-34.2%) and 19.9% (95% CI: 14.7-26.9%), respectively. Over a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 49 individuals entered drug-free remission.After initial diagnosis of seronegative RA, about 13% of individuals had a change in diagnosis and a quarter experienced drug-free remission within 10 years.This article is protected by copyright.

41386771,Risk of subsequent abdominopelvic surgery in women undergoing hysterectomy with ovarian conservation: A population-based cohort study.,"To compare the long-term risk of subsequent abdominopelvic surgery in women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation (H-OC) versus referent women, and in women who underwent abdominal H-OC versus vaginal H-OC.We conducted a population-based cohort study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA including 1573 women who underwent H-OC for a benign indication at age 18-44 years between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2002, and 1573 age-matched (±1 year) referent women who had not undergone hysterectomy or any oophorectomy as of the matching date. For both the H-OC women and the referent women, we defined the index date as the H-OC or matching date plus 6 months. The index date served as the starting point for follow-up.Overall, we found an increased risk of subsequent lysis of adhesions in women who underwent H-OC compared to referent women (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-2.27]). Women undergoing H-OC also had an increased risk of subsequent gastrointestinal tract procedures (HR, 1.18 [95% CI: 1.05-1.31]) compared to referent women. When comparing surgical route of H-OC, we identified an increased risk of subsequent adnexal surgeries in women undergoing abdominal compared with vaginal H-OC (HR, 1.91 [95% CI: 1.40-2.61]).Women who underwent H-OC have an increased risk of subsequent abdominopelvic surgeries compared to referent women. In addition, women who underwent abdominal H-OC have an increased risk of subsequent adnexal procedures compared to women who underwent vaginal H-OC.© 2025 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,"Dec 12, 2025",2025,Dec,12,Ainsworth A J|Smith C Y|Neblett M F|Rocca W A|Laughlin-Tommaso S K|Stewart E A|Khan Z,Ainsworth A J|Smith C Y|Neblett M F|Rocca W A|Laughlin-Tommaso S K|Stewart E A|Khan Z,"Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Epidemiology, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Women's Health Research Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Gynecology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ainsworth A J, Smith C Y, Neblett M F, Rocca W A, Laughlin-Tommaso S K, Stewart E A, Khan Z",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41386771/,"This study found that women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation had a higher risk of subsequent abdominopelvic surgeries, such as lysis of adhesions and gastrointestinal procedures, compared to women who did not have a hysterectomy.

41387456,Microbiome analysis of 940 lung cancers in never-smokers reveals lack of clinically relevant associations.,"In spite of the growing interest in the microbiome in human cancer, there are currently only small-scale lung cancer microbiome studies conducted directly on tissue. As part of the Sherlock-Lung study, we studied the microbiomes of 940 lung cancers (4090 samples) in never smokers (LCINS) directly from lung tissue using three data types: 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with paired blood, and RNA-seq. We observe very low biomass and few microbiome associations in LCINS using 16S and WGS tissue. Using RNA-seq, we observe more total microbial reads, and decreased relative abundance of several commensal bacteria at the genus and species levels in tumors relative to paired normal lung tissue. Among all datasets, we see no consistent associations between the lung tissue microbiome, or circulating bacterial DNA, and any available demographic and clinical features, including age, sex, genetic ancestry, second-hand tobacco smoking exposure, LCINS histology, stage, and overall survival. We also observe no microbiome associations with any human genomic alterations within the same samples. Every null result should be interpreted with caution given the possibility of future methodological breakthroughs. However, all together, using multiple data types in nearly 1000 patients, we find no substantive role for the lung cancer microbiome in treatment-naïve LCINS.© 2025.

41387629,Clinical recognition of frontotemporal dementia with right temporal predominance: a consensus statement from the International Working Group.,"Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with right anterior temporal lobe (RATL) predominance remains challenging due to lack of clinical characterization, and standardized terminology. The recent research of the International Working Group (IWG) identified common symptoms but also unveiled broad terminologies lacking precision and operationalization, with risk of misdiagnoses, inappropriate referrals and poor clinical management. Based on the published evidence (91267 articles screened) and expert opinion (105 FTD specialists across 52 centers) by using the nominal group technique, the IWG delineates three primary domains of impairment causing behavioral, memory and language problems: (i) multimodal knowledge of non-verbal information including people, living beings, landmarks, flavors/odors, sounds, bodily sensations, emotions and social cues; (ii) socioemotional behavior encompassing emotion expression, social response and motivation; and (iii) prioritization for focus on specific interests, hedonic valuation and personal preferences. This study establishes a consensus on clinical profile, phenotypic nomenclature, and future directions to enhance diagnostic precision and therapeutic interventions.© 2025.
