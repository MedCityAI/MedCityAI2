41380115,Management of Cancer During Pregnancy: ASCO Guideline.,"To provide guidance on the recommended management of cancer in pregnant patients.A multidisciplinary Expert Panel convened and conducted a systematic review of the literature.The systematic review identified 450 eligible studies. Much of the evidence consisted of observational data, case series, and case reports.Management of cancer during pregnancy should be grounded in a values-based informed-consent process outlining maternal and fetal risks and anticipated benefits. Diagnostic evaluation should follow the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle, with timing of diagnostic studies individualized based on urgency of cancer detection, potential dangers of delay, and the balance of risks to both the pregnant patient and her embryo or fetus. Due to significant risk of harm to the developing embryo and/or fetus, systemic therapy should be deferred until the second trimester. Methotrexate, hormonal therapies, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted agents, vascular endothelial growth factor and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and all cellular therapies are contraindicated during pregnancy, regardless of gestational age. For patients who wish to continue their pregnancy, delivery should be planned at or after 37 weeks, with the final chemotherapy dose scheduled 2-4 weeks before birth. Referral to psychosocial support services is essential to address emotional and practical challenges, reduce distress, and support shared decision making.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.",J Clin Oncol,"Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Loren A W|Lacchetti C|Amant F|Cardonick E H|Carey L A|Christian N|Clark C|Dizon D S|Henry M|Hudson M H|Maués J|Peterson E|Prowell T M|Raab R|Rogers J E|Saeed H|Sekeres M A|Taylor J S|Van Loon K|Wallace W H|Watson K L|Yadav S|Partridge A H,Yadav S,"Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.|American Society of Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA.|University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.|Cooper University Health Care, Camden, NJ.|University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.|University of Colorado, Denver, CO.|Oncology Nursing Society, Pittsburgh, PA.|Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.|McGill University, Montréal, QC, Canada.|St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.|GRASP Cancer, Baltimore, MD.|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD.|Messino Cancer Centers, Asheville, NC.|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.|Department of Oncological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL.|Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL.|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.|The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.|Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.","Loren A W, Lacchetti C, Amant F, Cardonick E H, Carey L A, Christian N, Clark C, Dizon D S, Henry M, Hudson M H, Maués J, Peterson E, Prowell T M, Raab R, Rogers J E, Partridge A H, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41380115/,"The key finding of this medical research is that the management of cancer during pregnancy requires a careful balance of maternal and fetal risks and benefits, with specific guidelines on the timing and type of diagnostic tests and treatments.

41380101,Benefit of Rituximab Maintenance After First-line Bendamustine-Rituximab in Patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma.,"The benefit of rituximab maintenance after first-line (1L) bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains uncertain, with inconsistent results from the phase 2 MAINTAIN trial and several retrospective studies. We conducted a large retrospective study at 27 US and Canadian academic centers to examine the benefit of rituximab maintenance after BR. A total of 911 patients received 1L BR between 2010-2020, and 703 had an objective response and no evidence of disease progression at the 3-month post-BR landmark. Among those, 394 (56%) received rituximab maintenance and 309 (44%) did not, with largely similar baseline patient and disease characteristics. In the landmark analysis, rituximab maintenance was associated with improved event-free survival (EFS, median 49.9 vs 29.7 months, P < 0.001) as well as overall survival (OS, median 109.5 vs 74.2 months, P < 0.001). The EFS and OS benefits were observed across most of the subgroups. EFS and OS differences were statistically significant in those who achieved a complete response to 1L BR (n=590; median EFS 62.7 vs 31.1 months, P < 0.001; median OS 136.1 vs 75.3 months, P < 0.001), but the analysis in those who achieved a partial response to 1L BR was limited by the small sample size. These results provide additional evidence for the survival benefit of rituximab maintenance after BR in MCL and support its use in clinical trial design and routine practice.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Wang Y|Larson M C|Hwang S R|Villa D|Kugathasan L|Kumar A|Joseph A|Brooks T R|Hill B T|Bond D A|Maddocks K J|Nizamuddin I A|Kahl B S|Danilov A V|Argao C|Ruan J|Ryan C E|Merryman R W|Grover N S|Khan N B|Ouchveridze E|Tun A|Ayyappan S R|Mou E|Pongas G N|Lossos I S|Harris Z I|Munoz J|Young P|Portell C A|Baidoun F|Alhaj Moustafa M|Reagan P M|Banaszak L G|Pophali P A|Velayati A|Greenwell I B|Gerber D|Jain P|Wang M L|Narkhede M S|Mehta A N|Stack A C|Messmer M R|Bhansali R S|Barta S K|Moyo T K|Ghosh N|Kamdar M|Anna J L|Stanisic A|Karmali R|Maurer M J|Cerhan J R|Cohen J B|Martin P,Wang Y|Larson M C|Hwang S R|Harris Z I|Munoz J|Baidoun F|Alhaj Moustafa M|Reagan P M|Maurer M J|Cerhan J R,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|BC Cancer - Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.|University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.|Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.|Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States.|The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, Staint Louis, Missouri, United States.|City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States.|Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States.|Kansas University Medical Center, Westwood, Kansas, United States.|University of Kansas Medical Center, Westwood, Kansas, United States.|University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States.|Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States.|University of Miami, Individual, Florida, United States.|Mayo Clinic, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States.|University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, United States.|Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, United States.|University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States.|University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, United States.|University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, Wisconsin, United States.|UC Davis Health System, Sacramento, South Carolina, United States.|Charleston Oncology, Charleston, South Carolina, United States.|Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States.|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.|Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.|University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.|UAB, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.|Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Helath, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.|Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, United States.|University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States.|Northwestern University, United States.|Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, United States.|Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.|NYU Langone, New York, New York, United States.","Wang Y, Larson M C, Hwang S R, Villa D, Kugathasan L, Kumar A, Joseph A, Brooks T R, Hill B T, Bond D A, Maddocks K J, Nizamuddin I A, Kahl B S, Danilov A V, Argao C, Martin P, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41380101/,This study found that patients with mantle cell lymphoma who received rituximab maintenance therapy after first-line bendamustine-rituximab treatment had significantly longer event-free and overall survival compared to those who did not receive maintenance therapy.

41379834,Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) Syndrome: Developing Diagnostic Criteria through a Modified Delphi Method.,"Topical steroid withdrawal syndrome (TSW) is an adverse event following discontinuation of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and is of growing interest among patients and dermatologists. The absence of well-defined diagnostic criteria and limited insights into the pathomechanisms make diagnosis and future research challenging.To propose preliminary diagnostic criteria for TSW with the erythemato-edematous subtype applicable for adult and pediatric populations using a Delphi consensus approach informed by a thorough literature review that summarizes the signs, symptoms, and histology of TSW.Eleven clinicians experienced in diagnosing and treating suspected TSW in both children and adults participated in a three-round modified Delphi process. Two rounds of surveys were conducted, with items ranked using a 5-point Likert scale. A predefined consensus threshold of ≥75% was established for any one feature to be deemed important. The third round involved a live video conference where the panel reached a consensus on essential diagnostic criteria.The panel identified 18 critical diagnostic items, encompassing elements from the patient's clinical history, signs, and symptoms. This includes history of escalating TCS requirement; morphology and distribution differing from primary condition; regional or generalized spontaneous neuropathic pain; and severe burning sensation of the skin.Differentiating TSW from conditions such as severe atopic dermatitis (AD)remains challenging. By emphasizing the common signs and symptoms of TSW, we aim to encourage discussions among healthcare professionals and progress towards the development of a reliable diagnostic tool.© The Author(s) 2025.

41379348,Self-Efficacy Is Associated with Health Behaviors Related To Obesity and Cardiovascular Risk Among Hispanic/Latinx and Somali Immigrants To the United States.,"Self-efficacy theory proposes that confidence to engage in a health behavior is associated with engaging in that specific behavior. Most research examining self-efficacy has been conducted with white young adult populations. This cross-sectional analysis examined the association of self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for healthy eating and physical activity in two immigrant communities. At enrollment into the Healthy Immigrant Community study, a clinical weight management and cardiovascular risk reduction intervention set in southeastern Minnesota, 475 participants completed assessments about their confidence for healthy eating and physical activity. Measurements also included self-reports of dietary quality and intake, physical activity, quality of life, and biometric assessments. Study materials were available in English, Spanish, and Somali. In total, 450 adults (Hispanic/Latinx = 267; Somali = 183) completed measures at baseline and were included for analysis. Their average age was 45 years (range 18-87) and 59% were female. Confidence for healthy eating was significantly correlated with self-report of eating healthy snacks (p = < 0.0001) and less consumption of high-calorie drinks (p = 0.02) and regular soda (p = < 0.0001). Confidence to be physically active was significantly correlated with more self-reported physical activity (p = < 0.01). Confidence to eat healthy and be physically active appears to be correlated with having a healthier diet and higher levels of physical activity. Given the large sample size and strength of the associations, it also appears that the theoretical model of self-efficacy can be effectively measured and applied within these immigrant populations. Self-efficacy theory may be useful in understanding potential mediating mechanisms when designing future interventions with immigrant communities.ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05136339; April 23, 2022.© 2025.

41379095,Anesthesia and Babies' Brains: Lessons from the Lounge.,"Melissa L. Coleman, M.D., Editor Early Exposure to Anesthesia and Learning Disabilities in a Population-based Birth Cohort. By Wilder RT, Flick RP, Sprung J, Katusic SK, Barbaresi WJ, Mickelson C, Gleich SJ, Schroeder DR, Weaver AL, and Warner DO. A nesthesiology 2009; 110:796-804. Reprinted with permission. Anesthetic drugs administered to immature animals may cause neurohistopathologic changes and alterations in behavior. The authors studied association between anesthetic exposure before age 4 yr and the development of reading, written language, and math learning disabilities. This was a population-based, retrospective birth cohort study. The educational and medical records of all children born to mothers residing in five townships of Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 to 1982 and who remained in the community at 5 yr of age were reviewed to identify children with learning disabilities. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for anesthetic exposure as a predictor of learning disabilities, adjusting for gestational age at birth, sex, and birth weight. Of the 5,357 children in this cohort, 593 received general anesthesia before age 4 yr. Compared with those not receiving anesthesia (n = 4,764), a single exposure to anesthesia (n = 449) was not associated with an increased risk of learning disabilities (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.27). However, children receiving two anesthetics (n = 100) or three or more anesthetics (n = 44) were at increased risk for learning disabilities (hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.37; and hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.60 to 4.24, respectively). The risk for learning disabilities increased with longer cumulative duration of anesthesia exposure (expressed as a continuous variable; P = 0.016). Exposure to anesthesia was a significant risk factor for the later development of learning disabilities in children receiving multiple but not single anesthetics. These data cannot reveal whether anesthesia itself may contribute to learning disabilities or whether the need for anesthesia is a marker for other unidentified factors that contribute to learning disabilities.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Anesthesiologists.

41378499,Perspectives on C-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Cardiometabolic Disease.,"Although CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) was first identified in brain tissue, its systemic expression and release is mainly located to the endothelial lining of the vasculature. As such, CNP should not be viewed as a classic blood-borne hormone but rather as a local factor that supports the integrity of vascular function. Albeit CNP is structurally related to both ANP and BNP (A- and B-type natriuretic peptide), the main signaling pathway is through a specific membrane-bound receptor without crosstalk from endocrine ANP and BNP. CNP expression and CNP-mediated effects can thus be uniquely targeted without interference from the related cardiac NPs. In this perspective, we present the CNP system as a largely overlooked target for potential intervention in cardiometabolic disease, hypertension, and diabetes before onset of complications and overt heart failure. To fully unleash this potential, with this perspective, we hope to fuel renewed interest with a focus on use of human in vitro and ex vivo systems as well as experimental medical approaches and human cohort data.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Goetze J P|Yanagisawa H|Kinoshita H|Burnett J|Nyberg M|Nishikimi T,Burnett J,Department of Clinical Biochemistry Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet Copenhagen Denmark.|Department of Cardiovascular Research Kyoto University Kyoto Japan.|Department of Cardiorenal Research The Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Department of Cardiovascular & Renal research Novo Nordisk A/S Måløv Denmark.,"Goetze J P, Yanagisawa H, Kinoshita H, Burnett J, Nyberg M, Nishikimi T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41378499/,"C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a local factor that supports the health of blood vessels, rather than a hormone that circulates in the blood.

41378455,PrevCardioOncAI: Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Cardiovascular Disease in Cancer Survivors.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in cancer survivors. Predicting CVD risk in this population remains challenging. Risk prediction models that use machine learning algorithms could provide an objective method for accurate risk prediction to facilitate the prevention and management of CVD in cancer survivors. We evaluated previously tested machine learning algorithms and logistic regression (regularized by machine learning methods), in addition to testing and validating newer, more complex machine learning algorithms, for CVD prediction in cancer survivors.This multicenter study used a database of 3835 multiracial cancer survivors with 89 clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic features over 20 years. Models were trained using repeated random and time-split samples and tested on a separate cohort of 329 patients. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Regularized logistic regression achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.845 (heart failure), 0.783 (atrial fibrillation), 0.792 (coronary artery disease), and 0.806 (composite CVD). These are comparable to 0.837 and 0.848 for heart failure, using Bayesian additive regression tree and random forest as more advanced machine learning models, respectively. De novo composite CVD (post-cancer diagnosis) was also predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.826 using regularized logistic regression, compared with 0.735 and 0.802 using decision tree and random forest, respectively.Regularized logistic regression and advanced machine learning models demonstrated similar predictive performance, with institutional transferability. These tools may support risk stratification and prevention strategies in cardio-oncology using longitudinal data.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT05377320.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Brown S|Fang M Z|Sparapani R|Zhou Y|Osinski K|Taylor B|Yu D|Blessing J|Shah R|Collier P|BagheriMohamadiPour M|Zhang J|Kothari A|Echefu G|Rickards J|Otto C|Sanchez Z|Olson J|Arruda-Olson A|Cheng Y C|Cheng F,Brown S|Arruda-Olson A,"Department of Medicine Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Heart Innovation and Equity Research (HIER) Institute Miami FL USA.|Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland OH USA.|Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Genomic Medicine Institute Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH USA.|Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Division of Biostatistics Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Department of Computer Science Milwaukee School of Engineering Milwaukee WI USA.|Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Department of Cardiovascular Diseases Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH USA.|Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Milwaukee WI USA.|Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.|Department of Internal Medicine Baton Rouge General Medical Center Baton Rouge LA USA.|Department of Medicine Mercer University School of Medicine, Mercer University Macon GA USA.|Miami Dade College Miami FL USA.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee WI USA.","Brown S, Fang M Z, Sparapani R, Zhou Y, Osinski K, Taylor B, Yu D, Blessing J, Shah R, Collier P, BagheriMohamadiPour M, Zhang J, Kothari A, Echefu G, Rickards J, Cheng F, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41378455/,"The study developed and evaluated machine learning algorithms to predict cardiovascular disease risk in cancer survivors.

41376595,Vascular Toxicities of Cancer Therapies: 2025 Update.,"Advances in cancer therapies have transformed many malignancies into chronic or manageable conditions, but these treatments have been linked to adverse events. Vascular toxicities associated with cancer treatment range from abnormal vasoreactivity to accelerated atherosclerosis, arterial thrombotic events, vasculitis, and arterial aneurysms or dissections. 5-fluorouracil and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors are the agents most commonly linked to abnormal vasoreactivity, whereas BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Arterial thrombotic events are seen with VEGF and BCR-ABL inhibitors as well as platinum drugs. Vasculitis emerged with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and arterial aneurysms and dissections with VEGF inhibitors. Radiation therapy can lead to several of the outlined vascular toxicities. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms of vascular complications associated with chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and radiation therapy. Key contributors include endothelial injury and dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. An understanding of the mechanisms of vascular toxicities may facilitate optimal treatment and preventive strategies in patients with cancer.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Donisan T|Balanescu D V|Abe J|Lerman A|Iliescu C A|Herrmann J,Donisan T|Balanescu D V|Lerman A|Herrmann J,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (T.D., D.V.B., A.L., J.H.).|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston (J.-i.A., C.A.I.).","Donisan T, Balanescu D V, Abe J, Lerman A, Iliescu C A, Herrmann J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41376595/,"The research summarizes the various vascular toxicities associated with cancer therapies, including abnormal vasoreactivity, accelerated atherosclerosis, arterial thrombotic events, vasculitis, and arterial aneurysms or dissections.

41376349,Magnetic resonance elastography characterization of meningioma mechanical properties for improved neurosurgical planning and resection a prospective cohort study.,"Accurate characterization of tumor stiffness and adhesion is crucial when surgically resecting meningiomas. Currently, such determinations are difficult to ascertain through standard preoperative imaging diagnostics and clinical experience. Herein, we explored magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) as a means of assessing these parameters and thereby improving neurosurgical resections.This prospective study of 193 patients with meningiomas involved three distinct patient subsets (cohort 1, 88 [2017-2021]; cohort 2, 55 [2022-2023]; cohort 3, 50 [2023-2024]. We analyzed preoperatively obtained MRE data on meningioma stiffness (cohorts 1 and 2) and adhesion (cohort 2) for accuracy, while matching subjects with or without MRE studies (cohort 3, 1:1 ratio) to define the role of preoperative MRE in improving operative outcomes.Areas under the curve (AUCs) for MRE in gauging meningioma stiffness and adhesion were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Both parameters significantly surpassed empiric predictions of stiffness and adhesion rendered by surgeons and radiologists, based on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRE-determined stiffness measures independently correlated with prolonged resection duration, whereas MRE-assessed adhesion showed independent associations with increased blood loss, longer duration of tumor resection, and higher risk of pial injury. Ultimately, results based on cohort 3 demonstrated that MRE has great potential in this setting to improve neurosurgical procedures by significantly reducing intraoperative bleeding, resection duration, and risks of pial injury.MRE is a promising, noninvasive tool for accurately assessing meningioma stiffness and adhesion, standing to improve the precision and safety of needed surgical intervention.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41373088,"Perceptions, Use, and Barriers of Clozapine Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in the United States: A Multidisciplinary Survey Study.","Clozapine is the preferred medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) suggested to mediate its safe and effective use. However, clozapine TDM is not a ubiquitous element of care in clinical practice. Understanding the current state of clinicians' perceptions of and barriers to clozapine TDM is a crucial step in improving its use.A survey related to the use, perceptions, and barriers of clozapine TDM was distributed across multiple national organizations in the United States, representing several disciplines.Most of the 190 respondents were consultants or attending physicians (42.5%) or pharmacists (52.3%). Nearly 80% of respondents had ordered clozapine level measurements in the year before completing the survey but identified slow turnaround time (TaT) as an important barrier; 73.5% of respondents noted that level measurements were performed at an offsite laboratory. Although 86.8% agreed that clozapine levels should be checked once an initial target dose was reached, less than half would subsequently order clozapine level measurements routinely, unless clinical factors such as nonadherence (96.5% agreement), new interaction (94.5% agreement), or change in smoking status (94.5% agreement) occurred. More pharmacists than prescribers indicated confidence in interpreting and clinically applying clozapine TDM results (84.6% versus 70.1%, P = 0.024), with a similar finding between the groups regarding faster clozapine TDM TaT, resulting in improved patient safety (89.0% versus 68.7% agreement, P = 0.003). In addition, more pharmacists would also conduct clozapine TDM in the setting of an acute inflammatory or infectious process (84.9% versus 61.2%, P = 0.002).These data provide insights into clozapine TDM perception, availability, TaT, and barriers. Further research is required to assess whether a faster TaT and more frequent clozapine TDM positively influence patient outcomes from a safety and effectiveness perspective.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41372636,Translational Relevance of the Genomic Landscape of KRASG12D-Mutant Colorectal and Pancreatic Cancers.,"KRASG12D is one of the most prevalent driver mutations in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). Although this genetic alteration is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, additional genomic features may contribute to the behavior of KRAS-mutant PDACs and CRCs.Here, we aimed at defining the landscape of these additional genomic features of KRASG12D-mutant PDAC and CRC, and their impact on clinical outcomes.This retrospective analysis utilized circulating tumor DNA data from two cohorts with advanced CRC and PDAC: a national cohort from Guardant (n = 27,497) and a Mayo Clinic cohort (n = 1434). Patients were categorized into three groups: KRASG12D alone, KRASG12D with putative resistance alterations, and KRAS not detected (ND). Genomic co-occurrences were summarized. Overall survival (OS) was compared among groups using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable survival analysis.Among patients with KRASG12D mutation, additional oncogenic alterations were detected in 34.5% of CRC and 11.5% of PDAC in the national cohort; 38.9% of CRC, and 17.4% of PDAC in the Mayo cohort. Common additional oncogenic alterations included EGFR amplifications, additional KRAS point mutations, and alterations in NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA. Patients with KRASG12D and these alterations had significantly shorter median OS compared with those with KRASG12D alone and KRAS ND for CRC (p < 0.0001) and PDAC (p < 0.0001). Presence of KRASG12D and additional oncogenic alterations was the only variable significantly associated with OS outcomes in both CRC and PDAC.We described the genomic landscape of KRASG12D-mutant CRC and PDAC, demonstrating that cases often have additional oncogenic alterations linked to resistance to KRAS inhibition. These alterations are also associated with a worse prognosis. Recognizing these alterations may inform new therapeutic strategies. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in ongoing clinical trials.© 2025.

40965158,Optimized use and performance of culture for periprosthetic joint infection diagnosis: a comprehensive literature review.,"SUMMARYPeriprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a significant complication of arthroplasty. Implicit in the diagnosis of PJI is the presence of organisms in what should be a sterile milieu. Given limits to culture-based PJI diagnosis, optimal utilization of culture in the diagnostic approach to PJI needs clarification. Culture is important in confirming a PJI diagnosis and characterizing the infecting microorganism(s) to inform management. As part of the development of a unified definition of PJI (by a group representing multiple scientific societies), a systematic review was performed to inform the role of culture in the definition of PJI. In addition, a comprehensive review on synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue collection for culture, and associated culture methodology and results interpretation, was performed to inform best practices. Gaps in the literature were identified to develop research priorities.",Clinical microbiology reviews,"Dec 11, 2025",2025,Dec,11,Esteban J|Patel R|Aguilera-Correa J|Nelson S B,Patel R,"Department of Clinical Microbiology, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, UAM, Madrid, Spain.|CIBERINFEC-CIBER de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Madrid, Spain.|Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Public Health, Infectious Diseases and Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.","Esteban J, Patel R, Aguilera-Correa J, Nelson S B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40965158/,The key finding of this medical research is that culture is an important tool for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and determining the infecting microorganism(s) to guide treatment.

41379753,A colorful legacy of hybridization in wood-warblers includes frequent sharing of carotenoid genes among species and genera.,"Introgression between species has the potential to shape evolutionary trajectories in important ways, but uncovering complex introgression dynamics has only recently been made possible by advances in genomics. Warblers of the avian family Parulidae exemplify rapid diversification and sexual trait divergence, and we endeavored to study historical introgression in the family. We sequenced multiple genomes of nearly every species, constructed a phylogeny for the family, and investigated gene flow across the genome and at genes known for controlling feather color. We found that DNA haplotypes including the gene BCO2, which encodes an enzyme that degrades yellow carotenoids, have spread among genera multiple times-from Vermivora to Geothlypis and from Leiothlypis to multiple Cardellina and Setophaga species. Patterns of inheritance in the latter case point to introgression that occurred 0.5 to 2 million years ago, and the shared haplotype among recipient species is less than 100 nucleotides long. Separately, we found evidence of introgression from red Cardellina species to both of the two red Myioborus species at BDH1L and from one red Myioborus species to the other at CYP2J19; both are key genes in the pathway that converts yellow carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids. Our results show that introgression is a common mechanism for the evolution of colorful plumage in parulid warblers and hint at complex histories of gene flow behind some of the Western Hemisphere's most colorful birds.Copyright: © 2025 Bennett et al.
