41100569,Disparity in Timely Breast Cancer Treatment: Concordance with Commission on Cancer Quality Measures and the Influence of Socioeconomic Factors in the National Cancer Database.,"Significant disparities persist in timely, guideline-concordant breast cancer treatment across the US, impacting cancer outcomes. The influence of both patient-level and facility-level socioeconomic status (SES) on adherence to Commission on Cancer quality measures remains incompletely understood.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database to assess associations between patient and facility SES and concordance with timeliness of 3 Commission on Cancer breast cancer quality measures: surgery, multiagent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, among patients diagnosed from 2018 to 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of concordant care, including a composite measure of facility-level social risk.The analytic cohorts included 471,425 patients for surgery, 82,734 for chemotherapy, and 311,523 for radiotherapy. Black race, uninsured status, and lower educational attainment were each independently associated with lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant care across all measures. Patients treated at low-SES facilities had higher odds of receiving timely surgery (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.31) but lower odds of receiving timely chemotherapy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) and radiotherapy (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) compared with those at other institutions. Facility type, fragmented care, and comorbidities also contributed to variation in concordance.Significant disparities in guideline-concordant breast cancer care persist by race, insurance, education, and facility-level social risk, highlighting intervention opportunities to improve outcomes for these already vulnerable populations. These findings highlight the importance of policy and institutional strategies that address both patient- and facility-level barriers to ensure equitable access to high-quality multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

40626591,Site Reviewer Perspectives on Implementation of Commission on Cancer Operative Standards.,"To reduce technical variation in cancer surgery, the Commission on Cancer (CoC) recently implemented 6 operative standards as part of its national cancer center accreditation process. CoC sites are evaluated for compliance with these standards through scheduled visits conducted by trained site reviewers. We characterized site reviewers' perspectives on the implementation of the operative standards.Twenty interviews were conducted with CoC site reviewers using a semistructured interview guide based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Themes were identified using thematic analysis mapped to the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.Site reviewers viewed the operative standards as an effective starting point for improving technical quality and were optimistic the standards would lead to positive change. Compliance was associated with supportive site leadership, effective interdisciplinary communication, and the availability of adequate personnel and institutional resources. In contrast, resistance from surgeons was identified as a key barrier. CoC site reviewers interpret their role as extending beyond assessing compliance, viewing themselves as advocates, educators, and partners to the sites.Overall, CoC site reviewers perceive the operative standards favorably. To enhance implementation of the operative standards, efforts should focus on modifiable institutional and individual-level factors, such as leadership support and surgeon engagement. Additionally, the multifaceted role of the site reviewers presents a valuable opportunity to improve compliance by formalizing the supportive relationship between reviewers and sites.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

41051081,Time Is of the Essence: Impact of Transfer on Outcomes in Acute Mesenteric Ischemia.,"Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a vascular emergency where delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to irreversible bowel injury and death. Many patients initially present to hospitals without surgical or vascular capabilities and require interhospital transfer. The clinical impact of such transfers on treatment and outcomes in AMI remains poorly defined.We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2019 to 2021) to evaluate the association between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients with AMI. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients were categorized by transfer status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with in-hospital mortality and procedural interventions, adjusting for age and comorbidity burden.Of 39,690 hospitalizations for AMI, 14.6% involved interhospital transfer. Transferred patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more often treated at rural or micropolitan hospitals. They were significantly more likely to undergo major surgical and vascular procedures, including bowel resection (odds ratio [OR] 3.48), mesenteric bypass (OR 3.32), and angioplasty (OR 2.66; all p < 0.0001). Markers of critical illness, such as intubation (OR 2.15) and dialysis (OR 1.30), were also more frequent in this group. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among transferred patients (OR 2.05), and transfer remained independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity burden (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.10).Interhospital transfer in AMI is strongly associated with increased clinical severity and in-hospital mortality. These findings emphasize the urgency of early diagnosis, rapid triage, and timely access to definitive care, supporting the need for structured regional systems and transfer protocols for AMI.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

41405856,Turncoat antibodies unmasked in a model of autoimmune demyelination: From biology to therapy.,"Autoantibodies contribute to many autoimmune diseases, yet there is no approved therapy to neutralize them selectively. A popular mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), could serve to develop such a therapy, provided we can better understand the nature and importance of the autoantibodies involved. Here, we report the finding of autoantibody-secreting extrafollicular plasmablasts in EAE induced with specific myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that these cells produce nonaffinity-matured IgG antibodies. These include pathogenic antibodies competing for shared binding space on MOG's extracellular domain. Interestingly, the synthetic anti-MOG antibody 8-18C5 can prevent the binding of pathogenic antibodies from either EAE mice or people with MOG antibody disease. Moreover, an 8-18C5 variant carrying the NNAS mutation, which inactivates its effector functions, can reduce EAE severity and promote functional recovery. In brief, this study provides not only a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response in EAE models but also a proof of concept for a therapy to antagonize pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Dec 23, 2025",2025,Dec,23,Taghipour-Mirakmahaleh R|Morin F|Zhang Y|Bourhoven L|Béland L|Zhou Q|Jaworski J|Park A|Dominguez J M|Corbeil J|Flanagan E P|Marignier R|Larochelle C|Kerfoot S M|Vallières L,Flanagan E P,"Neuroscience Unit, University Hospital Center of Quebec-Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.|Large Molecule Research, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA 02141.|Infection and Immunity Unit, Big Data Research Center, University Hospital Center of Quebec-Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Service de Sclérose en Plaques, Pathologies de la Myéline et Neuro-Inflammation, Hôpital Neurologique Pierre Wertheimer, Bron 69500, France.|Neuroimmunology Research Laboratory, Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, University of Montreal Hospital Research Center, Montreal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada.|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.","Taghipour-Mirakmahaleh R, Morin F, Zhang Y, Bourhoven L, Béland L, Zhou Q, Jaworski J, Park A, Dominguez J M, Corbeil J, Flanagan E P, Marignier R, Larochelle C, Kerfoot S M, Vallières L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41405856/,"The key finding of this research is the discovery of autoantibody-secreting cells in a mouse model of autoimmune demyelination.

41235176,Oncolytic measles virotherapy encoding the neutrophil-activating protein is effective in synovial sarcoma.,"Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive mesenchymal malignancy that is refractory to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy. We investigated the infiltrating T cell immune status in archived patient samples and tested the efficacy of an oncolytic measles virus (MV) encoding the secretory form of the neutrophil-activating protein (s-NAP) in SS. To assess T cell infiltration, we performed T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, comparing SS with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), a highly immunogenic sarcoma. Patients with SS had significantly lower T cell infiltration, reduced clonality, and higher TCR diversity than those with UPS. No differences were observed in the T cell repertoire between monophasic and biphasic SS or between primary and metastatic SS samples. Oncolytic MV-s-NAP infection of validated monophasic and biphasic SS cell lines demonstrated dose-dependent killing in all cell lines tested and a significant increase in proinflammatory markers compared to untreated controls. Additionally, repeated intratumoral injections of MV-s-NAP in an SYO-1 SS xenograft model demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects in vivo. These findings suggest that oncolytic virotherapy using MV-s-NAP, a potent Toll-like receptor agonist, may offer a promising immunovirotherapy approach for patients with recurrent or disseminated SS.© 2025 The Authors.",Molecular therapy.

39855674,Clinical outcomes of patients with unsuccessful mechanical thrombectomy versus best medical management of medium vessel occlusion stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory.,"Current randomized controlled trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with medium vessel occlusion (MeVO) stroke. Whether best medical management (MM) is more efficient than unsuccessful vessel recanalization during MT remains unknown.This was a retrospective cohort study using data from 37 academic centers across North America, Asia, and Europe between September 2017 and July 2021. Only patients with occlusion of the distal branches (M2 and M3) of the middle cerebral artery territory were included. Unsuccessful MT was defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 0-2a. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounders. The primary outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days after treatment. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with the primary outcome.Of 2903 patients screened for eligibility, 532 patients were analyzed (266 per group) after propensity score matching. The MM group had superior functional outcomes, with 32% achieving mRS 0-1 at 90 days compared with 21% in the MT group (P=0.011). Patients in the MM group also had significantly lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (3.4% vs 16%, P<0.001) and any hemorrhage (18% vs 48%, P<0.001). On multivariable regression, unsuccessful MT was associated with reduced odds of functional independence (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, P=0.011) and increased odds of sICH (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.84 to 10.10, P<0.001). Mortality rates were similar between groups (27% in MM vs 29% in MT, P=0.73).Unsuccessful MT for MeVO was linked to worse outcomes than best MM. These findings highlight the risks of prolonged attempts and emphasize the importance of efficient procedural decision-making to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

A comprehensive search of 6 electronic databases yielded 1,231 articles using keywords related to vestibular schwannoma, centralization of care, centers of excellence, and ethical considerations. After removing duplicates (n=344) and screening titles and abstracts (n=887), 17 full-text articles were reviewed. Two additional articles were identified through manual screening. A total of 15 studies were included in the final analysis.Hospitals were categorized by surgical case volume (high, medium, low) to compare patient demographics and clinical outcomes. Patients seen at low-volume hospitals (LVHs) were generally older and more racially diverse, and more likely to have public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), whereas high-volume hospitals (HVHs) served a younger, predominantly White, and privately insured population. Of the 14 studies evaluating outcomes, 12 demonstrated a positive association between higher surgical volume and improved outcomes, including reduced complications, lower mortality, shorter length of stay, and decreased hospitalization costs. High-volume hospitals also had significantly higher rates of routine discharge.Centralization of vestibular schwannoma care to high-volume centers is associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care costs. However, these benefits must be carefully weighed against potential ethical concerns, including disparities in access related to socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, and geographic location.Copyright © 2025, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",Otol Neurotol,"Dec 17, 2025",2025,Dec,17,Gauhar F|Grisham C J|Dambrino R J|Marinelli J P|Carlson M L|Kelly P D,Marinelli J P|Carlson M L,"Department of Neurosurgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Gauhar F, Grisham C J, Dambrino R J, Marinelli J P, Carlson M L, Kelly P D",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41403020/,"The key finding of this medical research is that centralizing the surgical care of vestibular schwannomas (a type of brain tumor) to high-volume hospitals is associated with better clinical outcomes, such as reduced complications, lower mortality, and decreased healthcare costs.

41403285,Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer in women with a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2.,"Women with a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at high risk of developing ovarian cancer and often recommended to undergo bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at an early age resulting in surgical menopause. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is an effective way to mitigate the adverse outcomes of early menopause; however, the safety of MHT on breast cancer risk in this population has not been established.We conducted a prospective matched analysis of MHT use following menopause and breast cancer risk in BRCA carriers. Women who initiated MHT were matched one-to-one with women who had not initiated MHT by gene, year of birth, and age at menopause, resulting in 676 matched pairs. MHT use collected by questionnaire included formulation and mode of administration.After a mean of 5.6 years there were 87 incident breast cancer cases in the 676 exposed women (12·9%) and 128 cases in the 676 unexposed women (18·9%) (P = 0·002). Compared to their unexposed matched controls, women who used estrogen alone (E) experienced a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer (HR = 0·37; 95%: CI 0·24-0·57).

41404755,Paradoxical Normal-Flow Aortic Stenosis Despite Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: Insights From the Randomized COMPARE-TAVI 1 Trial.,"The hemodynamic profile and remodeling patterns of paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis are well understood. However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction (NF-LEF) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF-LEF.In this substudy of the COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (< or ≥35 mL/m2) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF-LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction.NF-LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class >2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities (P<0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy (P=0.004). Compared with low-flow, low-ejection fraction, patients with NF-LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation (P=0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow-up, both low-flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index (P<0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF (P<0.001).NF-LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time-to-event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long-term follow-up.

41404973,"The Scarlet Letter of the Unmatched Neurosurgery Reapplicant: Trends, Opinions, and Guidance from a Nationwide Survey.","Increasing interest in neurosurgery residency has led to a growing number of unmatched applicants, who often struggle to find appropriate guidance for their next steps. The authors examined trends, opinions, and options available to unmatched neurosurgery residency reapplicants.Demographic data of U.S. applicants from M.D. programs obtained from the National Resident Matching Program (2009-2024) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA analysis of time-interval averages. Opinions regarding reapplicants were assessed via an online survey of national neurosurgery leaders, including residency program directors and chairpersons (N=356).All application trends showed greater change over time; however, the rate of accepted reapplicants showed no significant change among early (2009-2013: 4.8±1.8), mid (2014-2018: 7.6±4.8), and recent periods (2019-2024: 9.8±2.5) (p=0.068). The survey had a 23.0% response rate (82/356). Commonly indicated reasons for failure to match included poor interview skills, weak recommendation letters, and personality issues. Although most survey respondents supported candidates reapplying, dual applications (applying to >1 specialty) were not widely encouraged. For those reapplying, pursuing a preliminary general surgery or research fellowship, obtaining new letters of recommendation from new sub-internships, and publishing higher-quality research were the most endorsed uses of time before reapplying. However, most programs reported interviewing reapplicants sometimes-to-rarely and matching a reapplicant rarely-to-never.The number of reapplicants successfully matching into neurosurgery has not significantly changed for the past 15 years. Surveys indicate that leaders view reapplicants unfavorably despite reapplicants' efforts to improve applications. These results suggest that neurosurgery mentors may do a disservice to potential reapplicants based on how residency program leadership considers reapplications.

41405496,PD-1-based combinations before autologous transplant are associated with improved outcomes in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Combination therapy incorporating PD-1 blockade results in unprecedented response rates in both frontline and relapsed/refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Prior retrospective studies have suggested benefit for PD-1 blockade pre-ASCT but included few patients receiving PD-1 blockade with cytotoxic chemotherapy. To explore the impact of anti-PD-1 based salvage on outcomes for patients with R/R cHL, we retrospectively reviewed 1280 patients with R/R cHL who underwent ASCT from 2010-2022 at 6 transplant centers, none of whom received PD-1 blockade as part of frontline therapy. 25% received a PD-1 inhibitor at any point prior to ASCT (10% in conjunction with chemotherapy), 28% received salvage BV without PD-1 blockade, and the rest received salvage chemotherapy alone. Patients who received PD-1 inhibitors at any point before ASCT had a significantly higher 2-year PFS compared to patients who received BV without PD-1 inhibitors or patients receiving chemotherapy alone (88.2%, 70.2%, 67.4%, p < 0.0001). When restricted to patients in complete response (CR) pre-ASCT, the benefit of PD-1 blockade remained significant.

41405667,Optimization of Bone Cement Stiffness in Metastatic Vertebral Augmentation: Balancing Strength Restoration and Stress Redistribution.,"The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanical performance of vertebral augmentation with various polymer-based materials across different defect sizes. Specifically, this study aimed to identify the optimal stiffness of bone cement that maximizes vertebral strength while minimizing stress redistribution.A calibrated quantitative computed tomography-based finite element analysis (QCT/FEA) approach was developed and calibrated against cadaveric experimental data. Lytic metastatic defects were simulated in human vertebrae at two augmentation volumes (20 and 50%) and filled with materials spanning a wide range of elastic moduli (50 to 2500 MPa). Stress distributions and fracture forces were analyzed in six vertebrae to evaluate the influence of material stiffness and augmentation size.The QCT/FEA models accurately predicted vertebral strength (R2 = 0.96) and showed that increased material stiffness leads to higher fracture force but also significantly elevates stress concentrations. An augmentation material with an elastic modulus of approximately 300 MPa offered a favorable balance between strength restoration and minimal stress elevation, especially for 50% augmentation size. Paired t-tests revealed that materials with moduli ≤ 300 MPa did not produce statistically significant stress redistribution compared to intact bones, while stiffer materials (≥1000 MPa) did.The findings suggest that a bone cement stiffness of approximately 300 MPa may provide optimal mechanical benefits by enhancing vertebral strength without inducing excessive stress redistribution. The study also highlights that augmentation size strongly influences the mechanical outcomes, with larger augmentation volumes showing greater sensitivity to material stiffness. The proposed patient-specific QCT/FEA framework provides a cost-efficient, adaptable tool for preclinical evaluation and personalized planning of vertebral augmentation These insights can assist material developers in optimizing bone cement formulations for patient-specific treatments.© 2025.

41405892,Myocardial Dysfunction in Primary Mitral Regurgitation: A Review.,"Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation.Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention.A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR.

41407515,Invasive procedures for hiccups: a national single healthcare system study.,"On rare occasions, hiccups can cause morbidity, such as sleep deprivation, aspiration and even death. At times, palliative invasive procedures are considered. This study tested the hypothesis that invasive procedures can provide hiccup palliation with an acceptable safety profile.Multi-site electronic medical data were used to assess adult patients who underwent an invasive procedure for hiccups between January 1995 and January 2022. Hiccup palliation was defined as documented improvement in severity or frequency of this sign/symptom after the procedure.A total of 69 patients underwent one or more invasive procedures for hiccups (144 total procedures). Fifty-nine patients (86%) were men. The most frequent initial procedure was a phrenic nerve block (n=10) followed by oesophageal dilation (n=9). Only 31 patients (45%) manifested hiccup palliation after their first procedure. Nearly half, or 32 patients (46%), underwent more than one procedure (2 underwent nine procedures). Of these subsequent procedures, 35 resulted in palliation. Five adverse events arose from 144 procedures: post-esophagectomy atrial fibrillation, haematoma after cardiac device removal, vocal cord immobility after craniotomy, vocal cord immobility after vagal nerve manipulation, and a cerebral spinal leak after vagal nerve decompression.Invasive procedures can palliate hiccups with an acceptable safety profile.

41407519,Applicability of ChatGPT to generate multiple-choice questions for ophthalmology resident exam.,"Developing high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for medical education is a challenging and time-consuming task. This study aimed to assess the applicability of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in generating MCQs for ophthalmology residents.ChatGPT 4 was used to generate 100 MCQs, while an additional 100 MCQs were authored by university faculty. Item-writing flaws in both sets of questions were evaluated by a single reviewer. A quality assessment panel, consisting of board-certified ophthalmology subspecialists, compared the quality of two sets. Ophthalmology residents then answered all MCQs in a randomised order. The item difficulty and discrimination indices were calculated and compared between the two sets of questions.Item-writing flaws were more frequent in ChatGPT-generated MCQs (56%) compared with human-authored MCQs (27%, p<0.001). While ChatGPT-generated questions were comparable to human-written ones in most quality parameters, the distractor quality was significantly higher in human-generated MCQs (p=0.006). The mean resident scores were 46.5±9.5 for the ChatGPT-generated MCQs and 49.0±10.9 for the human-written MCQs (p=0.051). The difficulty index was 0.47±0.21 and 0.51±0.19, respectively (p=0.12). The discrimination index was significantly lower in the ChatGPT questions (0.20±0.19 vs 0.28±0.16, p<0.001).While ChatGPT can efficiently generate MCQs for ophthalmology residents, it has notable limitations, including higher rates of item-writing flaws and lower-quality distractors.

41407770,The interferon-inducible MxB large GTPase attenuates hepatitis B virus replication by activating the RIG-I innate immunity signaling pathway.,"The innate immune response has been reported to be perturbed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We hypothesized that the induction of the IFN-inducible dynamin family member, myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MxB), might support an innate immune response against HBV via mitochondrial alterations. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which MxB suppresses HBV replication. Knockdown of MxB in HBV-expressing HepAD38 cells induced morphological changes in mitochondria. These cells exhibited a substantial increase in the release of enveloped HBV particles, as determined by immunoprecipitation or sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. The expression of envelope proteins L/M/SHBs was increased in the cells, and HBsAg in the culture supernatant was also increased by 4-10 fold. When cells were stimulated with poly(I: C), the downstream signaling of RIG-I including the mRNA of type I and III IFNs was suppressed. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) clustering, which is required for this pathway, was inhibited by MxB knockdown. In conclusion, these findings provide support for a new model implicating MxB-directed HBV inhibition initiated by downstream RIG-I signaling that could promote the formation of MAVS clusters in the mitochondria. Enhancement of this pathway could be a potential therapeutic option for suppressing HBV infection.© 2025.

41408072,Mixture of checkpoint experts for explainable seizure detection using wearable devices.,"The current gold standard for detecting epileptic seizures is in-hospital video-Electroencephalography (vEEG), but vEEG is resource-intensive and imposes considerable burdens on patients and caregivers. Wearable devices offer an alternative to monitor seizures over long periods in a home environment and Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to analyze the data and identify seizure activity. The best performing ML models tend to be black-box models which do not provide a rationale for their decision, making it difficult to audit their mistakes and limit their real-world utility. To combat this, we propose a novel ML algorithm, Mixture of Checkpoint Experts (MoCE). MoCE provides direct insights into the behavior of a model at both the global (overall performance) and local (individual predictions) level that are not available with classic black-box models. Through a study conducted in 14 patients with epilepsy using wrist-worn devices, we demonstrate how this transparency is beneficial to both clinicians and data scientists, who can audit individual predictions for the reason of a decision, providing greater information about the model and its behaviors. Our experiments reveal that MoCE is capable of detecting seizures better than existing neural networks by retaining equivalent performance in recall with statistically significant improvement in false alarm rate while simultaneously addressing the issues of black-box models that many clinicians face.© 2025.

Here we conducted a pragmatic trial to assess whether an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based machine learning (ECG-ML) model enables early detection of advanced CLD. In this trial, 98 primary care teams were cluster randomized to intervention (access to ECG-ML results; 123 clinicians) or usual care (122 clinicians). Clinicians in the intervention arm were notified of a positive ECG-ML result, indicating higher risk of advanced CLD. The primary endpoint was new diagnosis of CLD with advanced fibrosis within 180 days of ECG, confirmed by sequential liver disease assessments. A total of 15,596 adults underwent 12-lead ECGs as part of routine care and met inclusion criteria (N = 8,034 intervention and N = 7,562 control). The intervention significantly increased new diagnoses of advanced CLD in the overall cohort (1.0% versus 0.5% in the control arm; odds ratio (OR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-3.55, P = 0.007). Among ECG-ML-positive patients, advanced CLD was more frequent in the intervention arm (4.4% versus 1.1%; OR 4.37, 95% CI 1.94-9.88, P < 0.001). The intervention also increased the detection of any fibrosis (secondary endpoint) in the overall cohort (1.7% versus 0.5%; OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.86-5.40, P < 0.001) and among ECG-ML-positive patients (8.4% versus 1.1%; OR 8.03, 95% CI 3.50-18.4, P < 0.001). The diagnostic yield below epidemiological estimates probably reflects variable clinician adherence to artificial intelligence-driven recommendations. These results demonstrate that an ECG-based machine learning model, followed by targeted testing based on risk factors, may aid case finding of advanced CLD in routine primary care.

39694810,CT perfusion for lesion-symptom mapping in large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke.,"Identifying eloquent regions associated with poor outcomes based on CT perfusion (CTP) may help inform personalized decisions on selection for endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between CTP-defined hypoperfusion and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) subitem deficits.Patients with anterior circulation LVO, baseline CTP, itemized NIHSS at presentation and 24 hours were included. CTP was analyzed using e-CTP (Brainomix, UK). Time to maximal contrast (Tmax) prolongation was defined as >6 s, and penumbra as the difference between Tmax and ischemic core (relative cerebral blood flow<30%). Voxel-lesion-symptom mapping was performed using sparse canonical correlation analysis. For each NIHSS subitem, and total NIHSS, the associations were plotted between Tmax voxels with baseline NIHSS, and penumbra voxels with delta NIHSS (24 hours minus baseline).This study included 171 patients. Total NIHSS was predicted by hypoperfusion in left frontal cortex and subcortical white matter tracts. Voxels associated with neurological recovery were symmetrical and subcortical.Limb deficits were associated with respective motor cortex regions and descending motor tracts, with negative correlation within the contralateral hemispheres. A similar but smaller cluster of voxels within the penumbra was associated with NIHSS improvement. Language impairment correlated with left frontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus voxels. With the exception of dysarthria, significant associations were observed and more diffusely distributed in all other NIHSS subitems.These results demonstrate the feasibility of hypoperfusion-to-symptom mapping in LVO. Symptom-based mapping from presenting imaging could refine treatment decisions targeting specific neurological deficits.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026. No commercial re-use.
