41195873,Evolution of the Indications and Outcomes of Total Pancreatectomy.,"The first total pancreatectomy (TP) resulting in survival past the immediate postoperative period was performed at Mayo Clinic in 1944. Although still uncommonly performed, indications have recently fluctuated. We aimed to evaluate trends in TP utilization and outcomes over four decades.Patients who underwent single-stage TP at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1988 to 2024 were analyzed in two cohorts: Early Era (EE, 1988-2009) and Modern Era (ME, 2010-2024).In total, 437 patients were identified: 118 during EE (mean 8/year) and 319 during ME (mean 21/year). Primary indications were adenocarcinoma (42% EE vs. 60% ME), IPMN (31% EE vs. 17% ME), and chronic pancreatitis (11% EE vs. 13% ME) (p<0.001). Concurrent vascular resection was performed in 9.3% (EE; all venous only) vs. 53% (ME; venous alone in 20% and arterial with/without venous in 33%) (p<0.001). Multivisceral resection was performed in <1% (EE) vs. 24% (ME) (p<0.001). Major complications occurred in 13% (EE) vs. 27% (ME) (p=0.018) and ninety-day mortality was 3.4% (EE) vs. 6.3% (ME) (p=0.35). For adenocarcinoma, 5-year median OS from both surgery and diagnosis was significantly improved in ME (p=0.009 and p<0.001, respectively). Median last HbA1c was 7.7 (EE) vs. 7.3 (ME) (p<0.001). Among patients surviving >1 year, insulin pumps were utilized in 12% (EE) vs. 49% (ME) (p<0.001).Use of TP has dramatically increased in recent years, primarily for adenocarcinoma alongside increased use of neoadjuvant therapy and ever-expanding criteria for anatomic resectability. Operative complexity has significantly increased with resultant increased perioperative morbidity. TP remains a higher-risk procedure, specifically with en-bloc vascular resections, emphasizing the importance of appropriate patient selection, preoperative patient education, and thoughtful postoperative and long-term management.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41193901,Interpretive consistency of a qualitative 68Ga-PSMA PET framework for treatment response assessment in hepatocellular carcinoma: a head-to-head comparison with cross-sectional imaging.,"Accurate treatment response assessment in HCC is crucial but challenged by interpretive variability on CT/MRI. PSMA has emerged as a theranostic biomarker in HCC; however, interpretive reliability is a prerequisite for its validation against oncologic outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated interpretive consistency of a qualitative 68Ga-PSMA PET framework for treatment response assessment in HCC, benchmarking it against CT/MRI criteria.Patients with treatment-naïve HCC were prospectively enrolled for 68Ga-PSMA PET under an FDA IND application. Eligibility for analyses necessitated a baseline 68Ga-PSMA-avid target lesion with post-treatment 68Ga-PSMA PET and CT/MRI for response assessment following either locoregional therapy (LRT) or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI). Three radiologists independently assessed response on 68Ga-PSMA PET using a 4-point scale, subsequently dichotomized to viable (uptake > liver) versus non-viable status (uptake ≤ liver). Reliability was benchmarked against binary mRECIST, defined by arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), ordinal and binary RECIST 1.1, and binary LR-TR criteria. Inter- and intra-reader agreement were quantified using Gwet's agreement coefficients (AC1/AC2), with differences between dichotomized methods compared using non-parametric bootstrapping.From 88 patients with baseline 68Ga-PSMA PET, 13 were eligible: 7 with 10 lesions received LRT, and 6 with 19 lesions received ICI. Overall inter-reader agreement on 68Ga-PSMA PET was almost perfect for both the 4-point qualitative scale (Gwet's AC2: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.96) and the binary viable/non-viable status (AC1: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.00). Intra-reader agreement was also almost perfect (AC1 range: 0.86-0.93). In contrast, inter-reader agreement for mRECIST was moderate (AC1: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29-0.77), though its intra-reader agreement was more robust (AC1 range: 0.72-0.86). In the ICI subgroup, inter-reader agreement using 68Ga-PSMA PET (AC1: 0.93) was significantly higher than for mRECIST (AC1: 0.37; mean ΔAC1 = 0.53, 95% CI for difference: 0.19-0.85, P = 0.006) and dichotomized RECIST 1.1 (AC1: 0.39; mean ΔAC1 = 0.52, 0.25-0.83, P < 0.001). In the LRT subgroup, inter-reader agreement using 68Ga-PSMA PET (AC1: 0.89) was also almost perfect, but not significantly different from mRECIST (AC1: 0.87) or dichotomized LR-TR (AC1: 0.88) (P > 0.99 for both), with similarly high and comparable intra-reader agreement across all methods in both subgroups (P = > 0.99).A qualitative PSMA PET framework for HCC treatment response assessment yields nearly perfect interpretive consistency, outperforming CT/MRI-based criteria in post-ICI settings. These findings provide the foundation to validate PSMA-based response against oncologic outcomes in future clinical trials, a critical step toward guiding patient management and accelerating therapeutic innovation in HCC.© 2025.

41193916,CT patterns of acute enterocolitis - a practical guide for the emergency radiologist.,"Acute enterocolitis encompasses a broad spectrum of conditions affecting the small and large bowel, frequently presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Given the clinical overlap among infectious, inflammatory, immune-mediated, vascular, and miscellaneous etiologies, imaging plays a pivotal role in refining the differential diagnosis, identifying complications, and guiding timely management. Computed tomography (CT), owing to its accessibility and rapid acquisition, remains the cornerstone of imaging evaluation in acute settings. CT enables detailed assessment of bowel wall morphology, disease distribution, vascular involvement, and extraintestinal manifestations. While ancillary imaging modalities have a role in select scenarios, this review emphasizes a CT-focused approach tailored for acute care. We present a comprehensive, pattern-based review of the CT imaging features across various forms of acute enterocolitis, highlighting diagnostic hallmarks, interpretive pitfalls, and clinically relevant mimics. The included cases were encountered by the radiologists in their day-to day practice and included based on their ability to highlight the majority representative features of each pathology. Through the integration of structured tables, illustrative cases, and diagnostic tips, this article aims to enhance the radiologist's ability to recognize key imaging signatures, avoid diagnostic errors, and contribute meaningfully to multidisciplinary patient care.© 2025.

41195640,Real-World Effectiveness of Switching to Oral or Infusion Versus Injectable Disease-Modifying Therapy in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis.,"To assess real-world effectiveness of switching disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) initially treated with platform injectables on disease activity.Of 2615 pediatric-onset demyelinating disease patients at 12 clinics in the United States (US) Network of Pediatric MS Centers, those with MS/CIS on initial therapy with a platform injectable who switched to another class of platform injectable, oral or infusion DMT were analyzed. Relapse rate was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for preidentified confounders.A total of 212 children switched DMT before age 18 (67% female, 95% MS). Ninety-three switched from injectable to injectable, 76 injectable to oral, and 43 injectable to infusion. Switchers to oral or infusion were older at onset (injectable 12.3 years, oral 13.5 years, and infusion 14.2 years) and switch (injectable 14.6 years, oral 16.0 years, and infusion 15.7 years). Switchers to infusion DMT were more likely to have enhancing lesions (injectable 45%, oral 28%, and infusion 67%). Compared to injectable (annualized relapse rate [ARR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52-1.48), relapse rates were lower for injectable to oral (ARR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.20-0.57; rate ratio: 0.38, 95% CI = 0.21-0.69) and injectable to infusion (ARR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09-0.37; rate ratio: 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10-0.44) (p < 0.001). Adjusted number needed to treat in person-years to prevent 1 relapse with oral over injectable was 1.84 (95% CI = 1.03-8.69) and infusion over injectable 1.43 (95% CI = 1.00-3.88).Switching from platform injectable to oral or infusion compared to other platform injectable DMT led to better disease control in pediatric MS.

41195642,Insights Into the Antigenic Repertoire of Unclassified Synaptic Antibodies.,"We sought to characterize the sixth most common finding in our neuroimmunological laboratory practice (tissue assay-observed unclassified neural antibodies [UNAs]), combining protein microarray and phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq).Patient specimens (258; 133 serums; 125 CSF) meeting UNA criteria were profiled; October 2022-September 2023. Top-ranking candidate antigens were validated in silico, by dual-staining confocal microscopy, and ≥ 1 protein-specific assay. Clinical data were reviewed.Among 21 patients, 11 autoantibodies were characterized (serum, 19; CSF, all 9 available). Autoantigens were CACNA1I, 1; CAMK2B, 2; CLIP2, 1; FMN2, 2; MAP1A, 2; MAP2, 5; NECAB1, 1; SNAP91, 3; SRCIN1, 1; SYNJ1, 1; SYT3, 2. Analytical validation was by confocal TIIFA (all), western blot (10/10 available), and cell-based assay (5/5 performed). Clinical accompaniments were: encephalitis, 6; brainstem encephalitis, 2; encephalomyelitis, 2; cerebellar ataxia, 2; longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), 2; sensory neuronopathy, 1; peripheral neuropathy, 4, and movement disorders, 2. Inflammatory MRI abnormalities were identified in 5/16 patients (31%) with CNS disorders: T2 signal change (2), LETM (2), leptomeningeal enhancement (1). Seven of 8 (88%) had inflammatory CSF (pleocytosis, 5 [median 25.5 cells, range 7-294]; elevated IgG index/synthesis rate, 4; CSF-exclusive oligoclonal bands, 4). Six had paraneoplastic causation (lung cancer, 2; other, 4); 3 were postinfectious (1 each of COVID-19, HSV-1, and post-Group A streptococcal infection). Of 9 immunotherapy-treated patients, 5 improved.UNAs are partly accounted for by a repertoire of diverse mostly intracellular synaptic antigens. Their characterization is expedited by protein arrays and PhIPSeq. Further individual studies are needed to assess them as disease biomarkers.© 2025 The Author(s).

41195728,Epigenetic age and telomere length correlations in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis.,"Age is the strongest factor determining disease expression in multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously demonstrated biological age acceleration in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) compared to controls with both epigenetic clocks (DNAm) and telomere length (TL). It is unknown whether these markers report overlapping or distinct aging-related processes.To determine the correlation between DNAm and TL aging markers.We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study within the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers. We calculated age acceleration residuals for the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge epigenetic clocks and measured TL from whole blood samples to estimate telomere to somatic DNA ratios (T/S ratio). We employed multivariable analysis of covariance to assess the correlation between DNAm estimates and TL.We analyzed biological ages in 270 participants (125 POMS, mean 15.7 years; 145 controls, mean 15.3 years). There were moderate correlations among the different DNAm clocks, but no correlations between DNAm clocks and TL in pooled analyses. In a stratified analysis, only the control group showed a modest correlation between TL and PhenoAge clock (r = 0.2, p = 0.06).DNAm did not correlate with TL in this sample of POMS and controls, suggesting that these biomarkers may capture complementary and non-overlapping elements of aging-related biology.","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","Nov 06, 2025",2025,Nov,06,Yang J H|Race J|Sumowski P|Jacques K|Fardad S|Fair A|Hazlett A|Lin J|Yilmaz D|Aaen G|Abrams A|Benson L|Casper T C|Chitnis T|Gorman M|Lotze T|Krupp L|Mar S|Ness J|Rensel M|Rose J|Schreiner T|Tillema J|Waldman A|Wheeler Y|Barcellos L F|Waubant E|Graves J S,Tillema J,"Division of Pediatric Neurology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.|University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.|Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.|University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.|Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.|The Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.|Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.|Texas Children's, Houston, TX, USA.|NYU Langone Health, New York, USA.|Washington University St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.|University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.|University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.|The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Division of Pediatric Neurology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA; Rady Children's Pediatric MS Center, San Diego, CA, USA.","Yang J H, Race J, Sumowski P, Jacques K, Fardad S, Fair A, Hazlett A, Lin J, Yilmaz D, Aaen G, Abrams A, Benson L, Casper T C, Chitnis T, Gorman M, Graves J S, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41195728/,"The study found that in children with multiple sclerosis, measures of epigenetic age (DNA methylation) and telomere length did not correlate with each other, suggesting they capture different aspects of aging-related biology.

41195764,Noninvasive Evaluation of Ventricular Filling Pressure and Pulmonary Vascular Reserve in Adults With Fontan Circulation.,"Exercise cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing diastolic dysfunction and impaired pulmonary reserve in patients with Fontan circulation. The diagnostic value of noninvasive parameters is unclear.Patients who underwent simultaneous exercise hemodynamic evaluation and peripheral venous pressure (PVP) measurement were included. Echocardiographic surrogates for ventricular filling pressure were compared with invasive measures. Diastolic dysfunction was defined invasively as either resting pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≥12 mm Hg or exercise pulmonary artery wedge pressure >20 mm Hg.Twenty-nine patients were included. Age at catheterization was 34±9 years. Atrioventricular valve systole-to-diastole duration ratio (S/D) and resting PVP were significant predictors of resting pulmonary artery wedge pressure (S/D: β=0.71 per 0.1 S/D [95% CI, 0.16-1.25]; P=0.01; PVP: β=0.68 per mm Hg [95% CI, 0.41-0.96]; P<0.001). By contrast, resting PVP was a predictor of diastolic dysfunction, whereas S/D was not. Based on these data, we proposed a 2-tier assessment algorithm with the first tier considering resting PVP ≤15 mm Hg and S/D ≤1.1 and the second tier considering exercise PVP ≤25 mm Hg in those with 1 elevated resting parameter. This algorithm showed a positive predictive value of 88% (95% CI, 47%-100%), a negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI, 70%-99%), a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI, 40%-97%), and a specificity of 95% (95% CI, 75%-100%). Exercise PVP indexed to peak oxygen consumption also predicted invasively measured exercise pulmonary vascular resistance index (β=0.36 WU·m2 per mm Hg/100 mL per min [95% CI, 0.08-0.64]; P=0.01).This study presents a simple, noninvasive approach for evaluating diastolic function and pulmonary vascular reserve in patients with a Fontan circulation.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Nov 06, 2025",2025,Nov,06,Cao J Y|Jain C C|Egbe A C|Reddy Y N V|O'Donnell C|Baker D|Celermajer D|Miranda W|Cordina R,Jain C C|Egbe A C|Reddy Y N V|Miranda W,Department of Cardiology Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Sydney Australia.|Sydney Medical School University of Sydney Sydney Australia.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology Starship Children's/Auckland City Hospitals Auckland New Zealand.,"Cao J Y, Jain C C, Egbe A C, Reddy Y N V, O'Donnell C, Baker D, Celermajer D, Miranda W, Cordina R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41195764/,"This study found that a combination of noninvasive measurements, including atrioventricular valve systole-to-diastole duration ratio and resting peripheral venous pressure, can accurately predict diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary vascular reserve in adults with Fontan circulation, a complex heart condition.

41196049,Association Between Nutritional Status and Survival in Patients Requiring Treatment for Spinal Metastases.,"The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) is a standardized tool for assessing malnutrition in patients with cancer. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of preoperative nutritional status as measured by PG-SGA on survival in patients requiring surgical intervention and/or radiotherapy for spinal metastases.Patients with spinal metastases who underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy for symptomatic spinal metastases were enrolled in the AO Spine Metastatic Tumor Research and Outcomes Network, a prospective international multicenter research registry, between September 2017 and August 2022. Using the PG-SGA, nutritional status was classified into 3 categories: A, well nourished; B, moderately malnourished; and C, severely malnourished.A total of 589 patients met the inclusion criteria; 362 were classified as well nourished (61%), 159 were moderately malnourished (27%), and 68 were severely malnourished (12%). The median survival was 491 days, 328 days, and 117 days for well-nourished, moderately malnourished, and severely malnourished patients, respectively. In the multivariate analyses, severe malnourishment (HR 2.5 95% CI 1.4-4.3, P < .01) and an ECOG performance status of 3 or 4 (HR 2.7 95% CI 1.2-6.0) remained associated with significantly worse survival.Malnutrition as measured by the PG-SGA demonstrated to be significantly and independently associated with postoperative survival. The PG-SGA is a simple and useful tool to identify spinal metastases patients at risk of early postoperative mortality, and inclusion in the preoperative evaluation of these patients should be considered.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41199344,"Non-invasive neuromodulation for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating efficacy, safety, and optimal stimulation parameters.","Non-invasive neuromodulation presents as an exciting potential adjunctive therapy for people with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). A major advantage of this approach is the absence of the neurocognitive and systemic adverse events commonly associated with anti-seizure medications (ASM), and the significant risks that accompany both resective epilepsy surgery and invasive neuromodulation techniques. The proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will investigate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), low-intensity focused ultrasound (LI-FUS), transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), and trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) for seizure reduction amongst patients diagnosed with DRE, with comparisons also being made between intervention types where applicable. Both immediate and long-term adverse events will also be discussed to offer greater insight into its use as a safe, viable, and reliable method of seizure control. The study's secondary aim will be to identify optimal stimulation parameters to better inform future clinical trial protocols and to maximise treatment efficacy in clinical applications.PubMed, OVID Embase, OVID Medline, and Web of Science will be searched for studies investigating the efficacy and safety of non-invasive nerve and brain stimulation techniques for the management of DRE. Two authors will independently screen relevant studies in Covidence, extract data, and assess risks of bias, with discrepancies being resolved by a third reviewer. The primary outcome will be seizure reduction, measured by mean/median change in seizure frequency and responder rate. Secondary outcomes will include the percentage of patients reporting specified adverse events. A meta-analysis will assess the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and the optimal protocol settings for each intervention. Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results.This study will analyse all relevant non-invasive brain and nerve stimulation methods using a consistent protocol, uniquely allowing for rigorous comparisons and result-pooling to evaluate the overall efficacy and safety of each stimulation method. Additionally, it will identify optimal stimulation parameters, where possible, to facilitate the use of these methods in future trials and clinical applications.PROSPERO CRD42023446051.© 2025.

41196614,Visual Outcomes and Complications Over 5 Years Following Lensectomy for Childhood Traumatic Cataract.,"The long-term outcomes of surgery for pediatric traumatic cataract are not well described; understanding these outcomes would inform parental expectations.To report visual acuity (VA) outcomes and cumulative incidence of ocular complications by 5 years following lensectomy for pediatric traumatic cataract.This prospective cohort study was conducted across 32 sites in the US and Canada among 75 children undergoing lensectomy from birth to less than 13 years of age for unilateral traumatic cataract. Of 75 children, 60 had primary intraocular lens (IOL) placement; 15 were left aphakic. Data were collected from August 2012 to February 2020. Data analysis was performed from October 2022 to May 2025.Lensectomy.The primary outcomes were best-corrected VA 5 years after lensectomy; period prevalence of strabismus and glaucoma (including cases diagnosed before lensectomy); surgery for visual axis opacification (VAO); and cumulative incidence of ocular complications by 5 years. Annual data collection was from medical record reviews through 5 years following lensectomy.Among 75 participants, 28 (37%) were female, and median (range) age at lensectomy was 7.4 years (0.1-13 years). Median (IQR) best-corrected VA at 5 years (available for 37 participants [49%]) was 20/63 (20/35-20/159) in pseudophakic eyes (n = 29; mean [SD] age at surgery, 7.2 [3.0] years) and 20/258 (20/56-<20/800) in aphakic eyes (n = 8; mean [SD] age at surgery, 5.5 [4.3] years). Age-normal VA was achieved by 6 pseudophakic eyes (21%; 95% CI, 10%-38%) and 1 aphakic eye (13%; 95% CI, 2%-47%). The 5-year period prevalence of glaucoma was 9% in pseudophakic eyes (95% CI, 1%-16%) and 9% in aphakic eyes (95% CI, 0%-24%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of surgery for VAO was 47% in pseudophakic eyes (95% CI, 31%-60%) and 13% in aphakic eyes (95% CI, 0%-28%). The risk was greater in eyes that did not undergo an anterior vitrectomy (84%; 95% CI, 55%-94%) vs eyes that did (15%; 95% CI, 2%-26%) (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 11.4; 95% CI, 4.6-33.1; P < .001).In this cohort study, while only half of the study participants had a 5-year follow-up visit, achieving age-normal VA was uncommon among the cohort in whom a best-corrected VA was determined. The prevalence of glaucoma at 5 years was low among those with 5-year follow-up, while nearly half of the pseudophakic eyes needed surgery for VAO supporting the need to monitor these children.",JAMA ophthalmology,"Nov 06, 2025",2025,Nov,06,Stahl E D|Sutherland D R|Repka M X|Hatt S R|Enyedi L B|Colburn J D|Yoon H H|Leske D A|Kraker R T|Beaulieu W T|Cotter S A|Holmes J M|Pineles S L|Weise K K,Hatt S R|Leske D A,"Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri.|Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, Florida.|Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Duke University Eye Center, Durham, North Carolina.|Spokane Eye Clinic, Spokane, Washington.|Ann & Robert H.

41198394,Consensus on Management of Refractory Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Disease.,"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are associated to chronic and challenging infections, particularly pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). While clinical guidelines provide treatment recommendations for the most common disease-causing species, they offer limited guidance on managing treatment failures. This study aims to develop a consensus-based decision-making framework for addressing treatment failure in NTM-PD.A panel of 16 international experts used the e-Delphi method to address gaps in the NTM-PD management. Initial statements derived from an open-ended questionnaire, supported by a prior systematic review. Iterative rounds of expert evaluation were conducted until a consensus was reached on treatment failure definitions, decision-making criteria, therapeutic strategies, and supportive care measures.Consensus defined treatment failure as the absence of culture conversion after six months of appropriate antimycobacterial therapy, while clinical and radiological deterioration were considered additional but non-mandatory criteria. Treatment intensification or de-escalation decisions were based on patient preferences, clinical status, comorbidities, disease severity, antibiotic tolerance, resistance patterns, and previous treatment history. Treatment intensification highlighted the necessity for personalised multidrug antibiotic regimens. De-escalation strategies focus on delivering optimal, patient-centred supportive care while minimising pharmacological adverse effects, by opting for simplified antibiotic regimens, intermittent antibiotic courses for symptomatic control, or the cessation of antimicrobial therapy.This study offers a structured approach to managing treatment failure in NTM-PD, addressing patient selection, treatment intensification, de-escalation, and supportive care while championing individualised strategies. Future research should concentrate on validating predictive factors for treatment response, refining therapeutic regimens, and investigating host-directed therapies to enhance patient outcomes.Copyright ©The authors 2025.

41198626,CHIP amplifies the risk of lymphoid malignancies in individuals with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL).,"Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) are prevalent clonal precursors associated with increased risk of lymphoid malignancies. However, the relationship between MBL and CHIP and their combined impact on lymphoid malignancy risk remains poorly understood. We screened participants from the Mayo Clinic Biobank to identify MBL using eight-color flow cytometry; CHIP was detected using whole-exome sequencing of whole-blood DNA in 291 genes related to myeloid or lymphoid malignancies. Incident myeloid or lymphoid hematological malignancies were identified using ICD codes and confirmed via medical record review. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Analyses were adjusted for age and sex. In 10,067 participants, 15% had MBL, and 9% had CHIP. No evidence of an association between MBL and CHIP (OR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.82-1.20) was observed. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 138 participants developed hematological malignancies (94 lymphoid). MBL (HR = 3.48; 95% CI: 2.27-5.34; P < 0.001) and CHIP (HR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.10-3.27; P = 0.022) were each associated with incident lymphoid malignancy. Compared to individuals with no precursors, the combined presence of MBL and CHIP significantly amplified lymphoma risk (HR = 7.18; 95% CI: 3.33-15.47; P < 0.001), more than doubling the risk among individuals with MBL alone (HR = 3.30; 95% CI: 2.06-5.30; P < 0.001). In contrast, the risk associated with CHIP alone was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (HR = 1.63; 95% CI: 0.77-3.47; P = 0.20). MBL and CHIP are independent hematological precursor conditions. While their combined presence amplifies the risk of lymphoid malignancy, CHIP alone may not be a strong independent risk factor.© 2025.

41198773,AI-generated neurology consultation summaries improve efficiency and reduce documentation burden in the emergency department.,"Physicians face a significant documentation burden, spending twice as much time on electronic health records (EHRs) as on direct patient care. Consultation summary reports from the emergency department (ED) are critical for continuity of care and clinical decision-making. This study aims to evaluate the quality and utility of automatically generated neurological consultation reports with clear recommendations, while reducing neurologists' documentation burden. We used neurological consultation reports (n = 250) from the ED as reference outputs. For each case, we fed the report's constituent components into the large language model (LLM). Using prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate auto-summarized reports, which were then compared against the original consultation reports. The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and semantic embedding (Clinical-BioBert) were used as performance metrics. The LLM-generated report exhibited high semantic similarity with the neurologist's report (0.89 ± 0.03). However, significant differences in report length were observed, with LLM-generated reports being more concise than those written by attending neurologists (61.56 vs. 94.75 words, p < 0.001). Additionally, LLM-generated reports were written in a more straightforward and accessible style (FKGL = 11.3 vs. 12.22, p < 0.001). Despite these strengths, the LLM-generated reports exhibited substantial divergence in writing style from neurologists' reports (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.25, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.09, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.19). LLM-generated neurological consultation reports demonstrate strong semantic alignment with human-authored reports while offering a more concise and accessible format. Notable differences in writing style suggest a standardized approach that, while effective in conveying clinical content, may lack the personalization of neurologist-written reports.© 2025.

41101339,Torso synthetic CT generation by integrating deep learning and segmentation for FDG-PET/MR attenuation correction.,"Introduction.Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) offers benefits over PET/CT including simultaneous PET and MR acquisition, intrinsic spatial registration accuracy, MR-based functional information, and superior soft tissue contrast. However, accurate attenuation correction (AC) for PET remains challenging as MR signals do not directly correspond to attenuation. Using deep learning algorithms that learn complex relationships, we generate synthetic CT (sCT) from MR for AC. Our novel method for AC, merges deep learning with threshold-based segmentation, to produce an AC map for the entire torso from Dixon MR images, which heretofore has not been demonstrated.Method. Twenty-nine prospectively collected, paired FDG-PET/CT and MR datasets were used for training and validation using the U-net Residual Network conditional Generative Adversarial Network integrated with tissue segmentation (URcGANmod) from Dixon MR data. Our application focused on torso (base of the skull to mid-thigh) AC, a common but challenging field of view (FOV). Performance was compared to that of 4 previously published methods.Results. Using 15 paired datasets for training and 14 independent datasets for testing, the URcGANmodgenerates an accurate torso sCT with a mean absolute difference of 32 ± 4 HU per voxel. When applied for AC for FDG images, and considering evaluable (SUV ≥ 0.1 g/ml) voxels across all regions of interest, absolute values of the differences were within 4.4% from those determined using the measured CT for AC. Reproducibility was excellent with less than 3.5% standard deviation. The results demonstrate the accuracy and precision of URcGANmodmethod for torso sCT generation for quantitatively accurate MR-based AC (MRAC), exceeding the comparison methods.Conclusion. Combining deep learning and segmentation enhances MRAC accuracy in torso FDG-PET/MR, improves SUV accuracy throughout the torso, achieves less than 4.4% SUV error, and outperforms comparison methods.
