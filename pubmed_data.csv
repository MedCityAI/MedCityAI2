41091083,Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients With Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction: The Underlying Role of Visceral Adiposity.,"It has been hypothesized that an impairment of kidney function may contribute to the development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the conventional threshold for the identification of intrinsic renal disease in HFpEF (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) does not consider age-related physiological changes. When adjusted for age, the appropriate threshold is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, leading to a prevalence of impaired glomerular function of ≈15% to 25% among patients with HFpEF. However, even this estimate of chronic kidney disease is inflated, since heart failure and its treatments lead to reversible changes in renal perfusion, renal venous pressures, and intrarenal hemodynamic changes, which do not reflect structural kidney disease. Accordingly, the risk of end-stage kidney disease in patients with HFpEF is exceptionally low, ie, <0.5% annually, far lower than the risk of death. It is generally assumed that hypertension and diabetes are the most important modifiable risk factors for the development of kidney disease in patients with HFpEF. However, in large-scale trials, pharmacological efforts to lower blood pressure or blood glucose have not had favorable effects on glomerular function or the risk of end-stage kidney disease. Instead, the principal driver of chronic kidney disease in patients with HFpEF appears to be obesity and visceral adiposity. Both obesity and visceral adiposity are accompanied by neurohormonal activation and imbalances in adipokine secretion that are established causal mechanisms-not only of HFpEF-but also of glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis-actions that are potentially augmented by increases in the mass of adipose tissue surrounding the kidneys. Alleviation of obesity and visceral adiposity with the use of bariatric surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduces the risk of both HFpEF and major adverse kidney outcomes. The sodium avidity and systemic inflammation seen in patients with HFpEF are not attributable to the presence of intrinsic renal disease, but are likely related to neurohormonal and adipokine-mediated pathways that are driven by secretions from an expanded fat mass. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that visceral adiposity is not only the primer driver of HFpEF, but it is also the principal determinant of its association with chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41031977,Central Adiposity or Hypertension: Which Drives Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"The 2 most prevalent risk factors for the development of heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are hypertension and obesity, but their relative importance in driving the evolution and progression of HFpEF has not been critically evaluated. The role of excess adiposity in HFpEF has been substantially underappreciated, largely because of reliance on body mass index (rather than waist-to-height ratio) to identify an expanded fat mass and on a meaningful elevation of natriuretic peptides to identify HFpEF. In the general population, changes in central obesity and visceral adiposity are observed years before HFpEF becomes clinically manifest, and central obesity is present in >80% to 90% of patients with established HFpEF, with the degree of adiposity being strongly related to the hemodynamic and clinical severity of HFpEF. Therapeutic amelioration of excess adiposity by bariatric surgery or incretin-based drugs appears to have substantial effects on the evolution and progression of HFpEF, with reported reductions of 40% to 60% in the risk of heart failure hospitalizations. Hypertension also increases the risk of heart failure, but in Mendelian randomization studies, HFpEF is more strongly linked to obesity than to hypertension. Furthermore, the available evidence from clinical trials does not support a consistent link between blood pressure lowering and a reduced risk of HFpEF, particularly in patients with coexisting obesity. Although a history of hypertension is exceptionally prevalent among patients with established HFpEF, in trials of patients with established HFpEF, drugs that lowered systolic blood pressure by 3 to 7 mm Hg yielded a heart failure event risk reduction of only 5% to 18%. Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed benefit on heart failure events was not related to the elevation of baseline systolic blood pressure or the magnitude of the drug-related decreases in blood pressure. Adiposity causes hypertension, and if excess adiposity is not alleviated, blood pressure lowering with many antihypertensive drugs may not be able to alleviate left ventricular systolic and diastolic and vascular stiffness. Taken together, the totality of evidence suggests that-in the current era-central adiposity appears to be more important than hypertension as a determinant of the evolution and progression of HFpEF.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40960442,Is Type 2 Diabetes a Modifiable Risk Factor for the Evolution and Progression of Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but it is not clear whether this metabolic disorder is causal or represents a modifiable risk factor. Mechanisms by which diabetes may be associated with HFpEF can be grouped into the following: 1) those related to hyperglycemia and amenable to antihyperglycemic drugs; and 2) those related to the association of type 2 diabetes with obesity and visceral adiposity, and thus, treatable with interventions that reduce adipose tissue mass or improve adipocyte biology.Experimentally, acute and chronic hyperglycemia caused by islet cell destruction can lead to cardiac dysfunction, but these models resemble type 1 (not type 2) diabetes. Heightened levels of environmental glucose can cause enzymatic or nonenzymatic modification of proteins and signaling through the polyol pathway, but interference with these mechanisms has not produce clinical benefits in patients with heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, lowering of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes with insulin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones has not reduced the risk of heart failure.In marked contrast, experimental models that link type 2 diabetes to HFpEF are typically accompanied by excess adiposity. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the association between type 2 diabetes and HFpEF is mediated primarily through a common link with central obesity and an expanded visceral fat mass. Changes in the biology of adipocytes as a result of visceral adiposity are sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and diabetes. Interestingly, the primary metabolic defect in the diabetic heart is lipid overload, not an impairment in glucose uptake or insulin resistance. Adiposity can promote HFpEF through the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines that lead to sodium retention and cardiac steatosis and fibrosis. Additionally, excess adiposity can drive the production of and enhance cardiac sensitivity to advanced glycation end products. Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter reduce the risk or progression of HFpEF, but this benefit is not related by the presence of diabetes or to the glucose-lowering effects of these drugs. Instead, their favorable cardiac effects may be mediated by their action to induce or mimic a state of caloric deprivation, thus restoring adipokine balance and alleviating the state of cardiac steatosis. Similarly, bariatric surgery alleviates both visceral adiposity and type 2 diabetes and reduces the risk of HFpEF.Taken together, these findings suggest that diabetes-associated HFpEF is mediated primarily through its association with excess adiposity. Diabetes is a modifiable risk factor if treatment is directed toward adiposity rather than hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with chronic hypoPT had higher risk of valvular heart disease [hazard ratio (HR) 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-2.60], peripheral artery disease (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.41-2.26), heart failure (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.44-1.90), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.38-1.81), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.05-1.64), and fatal cardiovascular disease (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.40-1.80) compared to matched controls. No significant difference in risk of stroke/TIA was observed. Cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between patients with surgical and nonsurgical chronic hypoPT. Females with hypoPT had a significantly increased risk of valvular heart disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and fatal cardiovascular disease compared to female controls. There were no differences in any cardiovascular outcomes between males with hypoPT and male controls.The risk of cardiovascular diseases was increased in patients with chronic hypoPT, particularly among women.

41247546,Septal Myectomy in Pediatric Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Evidence regarding outcomes of septal myectomy in pediatric patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) remains limited. This meta-analysis aimed to assess surgical outcomes and long-term survival in this population. A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases to identify studies evaluating septal myectomy in pediatric patients with obstructive HCM. Eight clinical trials comprising a total of 490 pediatric patients met the inclusion criteria. Among children undergoing septal myectomy for HOCM, the pooled early and late mortality rates were 3.3% and 8.5%, respectively. Concomitant mitral valve repair was performed in 7.3% of patients. Rates of complete atrioventricular block and permanent pacemaker implantation were 9.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The mean durations of intensive care and hospital stay were 34.6 h and 12.9 days. Postoperative wound infection and reoperation occurred in 3.4% and 6.4% of cases. Echocardiographic assessments demonstrated a marked reduction in LVOT gradient (from 86.9 to 16.2 mmHg) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Mitral regurgitation decreased from 49.8 to 6.4%, and systolic anterior motion from 84.9 to 19.9%. Septal myectomy in pediatric patients with HOCM is a safe and effective procedure, associated with favorable survival and substantial symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement.

41056789,Chronological survival improvement over time with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus targeted agents in metastatic colorectal cancer: An ARCAD database study.,"The combination of oxaliplatin-based doublet chemotherapy and molecular targeted agents is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the temporal evolution of associated treatment outcomes is unclear. We utilized Aide et Recherche en Cancérologie Digestive (ARCAD) data to evaluate the chronological changes in clinical outcomes associated with this regimen in metastatic colorectal cancer.An individual patient data meta-analysis was performed using data from 5424 patients enrolled in 13 randomized controlled trials within the ARCAD database between 2004 and 2017. Eligible patients received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Intervals of 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2017 were examined. Overall, progression-free, and post-progression survivals were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for key prognostic factors.Median overall survival improved over time, from 21.4 months (2004-2008) to 28.6 months (2009-2013) and 29.7 months (2014-2017). Similar trends were observed for progression-free and post-progression survivals. Multivariable analysis confirmed the treatment period as an independent prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survivals. Subgroup analyses revealed improvements in overall survival for left-sided and RAS wild-type tumors, whereas minimal gains were found for right-sided or RAS-mutated tumors. Increased use of subsequent therapies contributed to prolonged post-progression survival.We demonstrated progressive improvements in survival outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus molecular targeted agents. The findings highlight the importance of biomarker-driven treatment strategies and the evolving role of subsequent therapies in optimizing clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Patients with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses were excluded. Outcomes included new-onset depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation within 12 months postoperatively. Predictors were assessed using odds ratios. Timing of onset was evaluated with density plots.ResultsAmong 839,576 patients, 12,011 developed depression, 11,828 anxiety, 916 suicidal ideation, and 63 homicidal ideation. Most diagnoses occurred within 90 days postoperatively, with peak incidence around 3 weeks. Opioid use during the index admission significantly increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR 2.13, P = 0.001), anxiety (OR 1.26, P = 0.002), and showed a trend toward depression (OR 1.14, P = 0.087). Medicaid insurance was the strongest predictor of suicidal (OR 3.69) and homicidal ideation (OR 6.41). Female sex and younger age were associated with anxiety and depression; older age was protective against ideation.ConclusionsNew-onset psychiatric disorders are a frequent and early complication following lumbar fusion. Several modifiable and demographic factors - including perioperative opioid use and socioeconomic status - significantly predict risk.

41246814,Reduced Circulating α-Klotho Levels Are Associated With Elevated Mortality and Arterial Calcifications of Aorta and Iliac Arteries.,"α-Klotho is a multifunctional protein implicated in vascular aging. Declining Klotho levels are associated with arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular calcification. We investigated the associations between circulating klotho, aortoiliac calcification, endothelial progenitor cells, and 10-year survival.In this retrospective cohort, blinded clinicians scored calcification on computed tomography (0-10 scale: aorta 6 points, iliac 4 points). Plasma klotho was measured by ELISA; endothelial progenitor cell subsets were quantified via flow cytometry. Mortality data were obtained from the Minnesota Death Registry.This study included 148 participants (mean age 72.4±9.6 years; 41% female). Median calcification score was 3 (interquartile range, 1-5). Patients with low calcification had higher Klotho levels (669 [567-841] versus 556 [457-678] pg/mL; P<0.01), with Klotho inversely correlated with calcification (r=-0.315, P<0.01). Stratified by calcification location and severity, the highest Klotho levels were seen in patients without aortic or iliac calcification (P=0.015). Over 10 years, low Klotho was independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 3.056 [95% CI 1.288-7.878]; P=0.014). Klotho inversely correlated with mature osteocalcin-positive EPCs; B=-0.16 (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.02; P=0.027).

41246825,External Validation of the Fraser Equation for Estimation of Free Valproate Concentrations in Critically Ill Adults.,"Critically ill patients may be overexposed to valproate because altered protein binding leads to a disproportionate free valproate fraction. The Fraser equation was derived and internally validated to estimate critically ill patients' free valproate concentrations, but it requires external validation.Adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients at two academic centers with concurrently measured free and total valproate concentrations were included. Free valproate concentrations were estimated using the Fraser equation which includes total valproate, albumin and BUN concentration, and whether the patient received propofol or aspirin. The primary outcome was Fraser equation performance, assessed using Bland-Altman methods. Comparative performance against estimates from the Doré equation (an alternative predictive equation), therapeutic concordance using a target free valproate range of 5-15 mg/L, and equation improvements were explored.Overall, 315 patients and 556 free-total valproate concentration pairs were included. The mean (±SD) age was 58 (±17) years and 90 (29%) patients were on valproate prior to hospital admission. The Fraser equation estimated free valproate concentrations were correlated with measured concentrations (r = 0.728) with a negative bias (mean bias -2.77 mg/L, 95% LOA -18.9, 13.4). The Fraser equation increasingly underestimated measured concentrations as measured concentrations increased. 71% of Fraser equation estimates were therapeutically concordant (e.g., estimate and measured both within reference range) compared to 61.9% of Doré estimates (p = 0.001). Fraser equation modifications led to minor performance improvements but did not overcome worsening underestimation with higher measured free valproate concentrations.The Fraser equation was moderately accurate and corresponded with an appropriate interpretation for 71% of free valproate concentrations. Worse underestimation with higher measured free valproate concentrations suggests direct measurement of free valproate concentrations is warranted. While the Fraser equation could complement therapeutic decision making at centers where direct free valproate measurements are unavailable or slow to return, its accuracy is currently insufficient to replace direct measurement.© 2025 ACCP Foundation, Ltd.",Pharmacotherapy,"Nov 17, 2025",2025,Nov,17,Webb A J|Brown C S|Liu J|Riker R R|Lopez N D|Rosenthal E S|Zafar S F|Gagnon D J,Brown C S,"Department of Pharmacy, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Pharmacy, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine, USA.|Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mass General Brigham/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Pharmacy, Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine, USA.|MaineHealth Institute for Research, Scarborough, Maine, USA.","Webb A J, Brown C S, Liu J, Riker R R, Lopez N D, Rosenthal E S, Zafar S F, Gagnon D J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41246825/,"The study found that the Fraser equation, which estimates free valproate concentrations in critically ill patients, was moderately accurate but tended to underestimate the concentrations, especially at higher levels.

41246918,"Ethics, economics, and patient-centered outcomes of spinal cord stimulation.","With the widespread integration of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) into clinical practice, understanding its ethical, economic, and patient-centered implications has become increasingly important. This review critically examines recent evidence across these domains to illuminate challenges and opportunities for advancing transparent, ethical, patient-centered, and value-based neuromodulation practice.Recent analyses reveal persistent challenges with bias, conflicts of interest, and selective outcome reporting in neuromodulation research. Studies demonstrate significant disparities in access to SCS across racial and socioeconomic groups and highlight new ethical considerations associated with artificial intelligence-enabled and informed treatment in neuromodulation. Contemporary randomized trials support clinically meaningful improvements in pain, functionality, psychological outcomes, and other patient-centered outcomes, although durability remains inconsistent because of the potential for therapy habituation or adverse events. Despite high initial upfront costs, evaluations of SCS cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems generally favor SCS over conventional medical management when assessed over multiyear periods, with differential economic benefits observed based on the type of waveform and type of national healthcare system.While current evidence supports the clinical and long-term economic benefits of SCS in defined clinical contexts and indications, gaps in research transparency, equitable access to care, economic considerations, and durability of effectiveness persist.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This retrospective study aimed to achieve two objectives: (1) to characterize the indications and frequency of dantrolene administration in both medical and surgical settings, and (2) to evaluate whether perioperative dantrolene may serve as a surrogate marker for identifying MH cases. Using pharmacy records, we identified hospitalized patients who received dantrolene between 2010 and 2024. Each recipient underwent a chart review to examine the clinical context of dantrolene administration. A total of 1,199,450 inpatient pharmacy records were reviewed, revealing 118 patients who received dantrolene, resulting in an incidence rate of 1 in 10,165 hospital admissions (95% CI: 1 in 8,488 to 1 in 12,280). Among these, 87 patients (74%) received oral dantrolene: 84 for chronic spasticity, two for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and one as preoperative prophylaxis due to a history of MH. The remaining 31 patients (26%) received intravenous dantrolene. Seventeen patients received perioperative dantrolene for suspected MH; of these, nine cases (53%) were subsequently clinically confirmed as MH. Based on these findings and the total number of surgical procedures involving general anesthesia (n=885,127), the estimated prevalence of MH following general anesthesia was calculated to be 1 in 98,328 exposures (95% CI: 1 in 51,813 to 1 in 215,054).

41247746,Peripheral Neuropathy: A Review.,"Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide.Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments.Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms.

41247648,"Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy and Glucose Metabolism: The Good, the Bad and the Unsightly.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two prevalent and interrelated conditions that share common pathophysiological mechanisms, including insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. While newer glucose-lowering agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular outcomes, a number of commonly used cardiovascular pharmacologic agents such as thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and statins have been associated with adverse effects on glucose metabolism, including increased insulin resistance and elevated risk of T2DM. This narrative review examines both the detrimental and beneficial metabolic effects of various cardiovascular drugs, explores their underlying mechanisms, and discusses the implications for the prevention and management of metabolic dysfunction in patients at high cardiometabolic risk.

41248983,Transcriptional readthrough at Atf4 locus suppresses Rps19bp1 and impairs heart development.,"Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) functions as a transcriptional regulator in various cell types and tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions. While previous studies have linked ATF4 activation with promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, its role in developing CMs remains unexplored.We generated multiple distinct CM-specific (Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) and Atf4cKO(e2)) and global Atf4 knockout (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins) mouse models targeting different Atf4 regions, as well as cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 to study cardiac phenotypes. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses were performed. Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) (targeting exon 2-3 including the polyadenylation signal (polyA)) mice exhibited severe cardiac defects and died before E17.5, likely due to ectopic activation of p53 signaling pathway resulting from Rps19bp1 downregulation, a potent suppressor of p53. Further investigation revealed that deleting the polyA signal of Atf4 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice led to transcriptional readthrough, resulting in the formation of an Atf4-Cacna1i fusion transcript and Rps19bp1 downregulation. To avoid readthrough while abolishing ATF4 function, we introduced small indels into exon 3 of Atf4 in mice (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins), which showed normal Rps19bp1 expression and cardiac morphology. Importantly, CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 recapitulated the cardiac defects and transcriptional change seen in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice.We found that the downregulation of Rps19bp1, not loss of ATF4 function, underlying the cardiac phenotypes in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. The reduced expression of Rps19bp1 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice is likely due to the unintentional deletion of Atf4 polyA signal and subsequent transcriptional readthrough, underscoring the essential role of RPS19BP1, not ATF4, in cardiac development. Consistent Rps19bp1 downregulation has been observed in other tissue-specific Atf4 knockout models utilizing the Atf4fl(e2/3/pA) allele, suggesting that previously reported Atf4 KO phenotypes may result from Atf4 transcriptional readthrough effects. These findings reveal a locus-dependent transcriptional interference mechanism and emphasize the importance of avoiding confounding cis effects in genetically engineered models.© The Author(s) 2025.

41249036,Natural history of asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic regurgitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The natural history of asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR) remains uncertain, with conflicting reports about its progression and surgical timing. We aimed to quantify adverse outcomes under conservative management and evaluate the association of aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR) with mortality.Systematic searches (inception-July 2025) identified cohort studies of asymptomatic moderate/severe AR. Random-effects models estimated pooled incidence rates of adverse events; fixed-effects models were used for hazard ratios (HRs) of AVR vs conservative management.Twenty-seven studies (4720 patients; mean age 49 years; mean follow-up 3.9 years) were included. Pooled incidence rates per 100 person-years were 1.75 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.29 for cardiac death, 0.29 for sudden death, 4.30 for new symptoms and 7.01 for AVR. Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in only 0.9 per 100 person-years. Mortality rates were more than double those of the general population across age groups-2.45 (1.90 to 3.18) per 100 person-years for cohorts with mean age ≥50 years versus 0.59 (0.29 to 1.21) for younger cohorts. Early AVR was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.37).Asymptomatic moderate/severe AR carries significant excess mortality irrespective of age, contradicting its historically benign reputation. Given the rarity of asymptomatic LV dysfunction, earlier intervention guided by more sensitive markers of LV damage may improve outcomes, although heterogeneity and study quality warrant cautious interpretation.CRD42024522683.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41249658,Establishing cancer registries in Africa - focus on hepatopancreatobiliary cancers.,"Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in Africa, where the risk factors, tumour characteristics, treatment-related factors and survival outcomes are poorly characterized. Despite the high incidence and mortality rates of HPB cancers in Africans, there is a dearth of data on the genetic and non-genetic risk factors for HPB cancers in Africa. The incidence and mortality rates of HPB cancers in Africans can only be substantially reduced by increasing our understanding of the population-specific risk factors and potentially unique underlying tumour biology. Pursuing this goal requires the establishment of robust clinical and population-based registries across the African continent for risk assessment, which will enable the development of strategies for HPB cancer prevention and implementation of surveillance programmes for early cancer detection in individuals at high risk. This goal was the premise for establishing the Africa HepatoPancreatoBiliary Cancer Consortium (AHPBCC). In this Roadmap article, we discuss the AHPBCC's collaborative efforts to increase knowledge about HPB cancers in Africans and to promote Africa-focused research on HPB cancers. We also provide in-depth discussions on the establishment of cancer registries in Africa, including the challenges, best practices and areas for growth, to improve HPB cancer outcomes in Africa.© 2025.

40839167,Human obesity decreases the anti-inflammatory functionality of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/stomal cells by upregulating IL-1β expression.,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess therapeutic properties that mediate repair. Obesity impairs MSC functionality and therapeutic efficacy, possibly by eliciting dynamic modifications of epigenetic markers, like 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).We hypothesized that human obesity alters the 5hmC landscape and anti-inflammatory capacity of adipose tissue-derived MSCs to activate the prominent inflammatory signaling mediator Interleukin (IL)-1β.Adipose tissue samples were collected from obese and lean individuals (body mass index ≥30 or <30 kg/m2, respectively, n = 11 each) during weight-loss or kidney donation surgery.MSCs were harvested and analyzed for 5hmC profiles (MeDIP-seq) and mRNA expression (RNA-seq) (n = 5 each). Subsequently, MSCs or a vehicle were injected into mice, (n = 6 each) and two-weeks later, kidneys were evaluated using in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging and ex vivo studies. The role of IL-1β was then studied in-vitro in MSC-induced immunomodulation using siRNA in macrophages.Compared to MSC from lean patients, obese-MSC genes showed 2087 differential 5hmC modifications and 175 differential mRNA expression. Among them, 14 genes with overlapping alterations were involved in regulation of cytokine production, prominently IL-1β. Injecting obese MSCs elevated renal expression of IL-1β and M1 macrophage count but lowered kidney perfusion. Silencing IL-1β in obese-MSCs in vitro reduced M1 phenotype switching in co-incubated macrophages.Obesity induces epigenetic and gene expression changes in MSCs, particularly in IL-1β, associated with impaired anti-inflammatory functionality of MSCs. Targeting IL-1β could be a useful therapeutic approach to modulate the decline in MSC functionality resulting from obesity.© The Author(s) 2025. Published by Oxford University Press.
