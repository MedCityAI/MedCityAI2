41159979,Tricuspid Regurgitation Across the Spectrum of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is linked to more advanced stages with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), but it may also develop at earlier stages of HFpEF, such as those with isolated exercise-induced congestion.This study sought to evaluate the prevalence, distribution, and prognostic significance of STR mechanisms across the spectrum of HFpEF.Cardiac structure, function, hemodynamics, and clinical outcomes were compared among patients with HFpEF phenotypes categorized according to the presence of PVD (pulmonary vascular resistance >2 WU), and elevation in filling pressure at rest vs provocation (leg-elevation or exercise), as well as according to the presence of atrial or ventricular STR (A-STR, V-STR).Of 1,091 patients (median age 65 years, 60.3% women), 669 (61.3%) had HFpEF (20.2% exercise HFpEF - PVD, 38.6% rest HFpEF - PVD, 15.5% exercise HFpEF + PVD, 25.7% rest HFpEF + PVD). Moderate or severe STR was present in 17.4% overall, but increased with PVD (6.7%, 11.6%, 18.3%, and 33.7%, respectively), although moderate or severe STR was still more common in exercise-only HFpEF vs noncardiac dyspnea patients (11.7% vs 6.5%; P = 0.047). Most STR (69%) fulfilled criteria for V-STR, but those individuals had similar atrial fibrillation prevalence and greater atrial remodeling compared with A-STR. V-STR was independently associated with composite of death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization (multivariable HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.10-2.65) as well as death and HF hospitalizations each alone, whereas A-STR was associated with increased risk of HF hospitalizations (multivariable Fine-Gray HR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.12-4.37).STR in HFpEF is associated with PVD and less strongly with higher resting filling pressure. Although V-STR is the more common phenotype of STR in HFpEF, these patients also have substantial atrial myopathy, suggesting a mixed mechanism. TR was more prevalent in exercise HFpEF and exercise pulmonary hypertension than with noncardiac dyspnea; with none in the latter group having moderate-severe or severe TR, highlighting the importance of exercise hemodynamics. V-STR conferred excess mortality and HF hospitalizations, but A-STR conferred only excess HF hospitalizations.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40892609,Effect of Vericiguat on Total Heart Failure Events in Compensated Outpatients With HFrEF: Insights From VICTOR.,"In the VICTOR (Vericiguat Global Study in Participants With Chronic Heart Failure) trial, in a contemporary ambulatory cohort with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and no recent hospitalization, the primary outcome of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and cardiovascular death was not statistically significantly reduced with vericiguat. Vericiguat reduced risk of mortality but not HHF. In this ambulatory compensated cohort, time to first HHF may underestimate the overall worsening HF burden by failing to consider the high proportion of outpatient worsening HF events.This study aimed to determine the effect of vericiguat on the overall risk of worsening HF by incorporating the entire patient experience of worsening outpatient and inpatient HF episodes.VICTOR was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of vericiguat in ambulatory patients with HFrEF who had not experienced recent worsening (defined as HHF admission within 6 months or outpatient intravenous diuretic use within 3 months) and were on a background of high use of contemporary guideline therapy. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death or HHF. The current analysis provides detailed effects of vericiguat on overall worsening HF in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, including urgent care visits for intravenous diuretics or outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification.A total of 6,105 participants were randomized. Outpatient worsening HF was more common as the first worsening HF event (n = 851, 59.3%), compared with HHF (n = 507, 35.4%) or urgent HF visits (n = 76, 5.3%). Outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification was associated with increased mortality (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.47-1.94; P < 0.001). Overall worsening HF occurred in 686 participants (22.5%) in the vericiguat group and 748 participants (24.8%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-1.00; P = 0.047). The composite of all-cause death and overall worsening HF occurred in 917 participants (30.0%) in the vericiguat group and 1,004 participants (32.9%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; P = 0.016).In compensated patients with HFrEF on contemporary guideline therapy, worsening HF in outpatients was more common than HHF and was associated with higher risk of mortality. Exploratory analyses suggested a potential reduction in overall worsening HF events when both inpatient and outpatient settings were considered.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40864019,Echocardiographic Changes With Mavacamten in Nonobstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Exploratory Insights From the ODYSSEY-HCM Trial.,"Symptomatic nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM) lacks approved therapies. The ODYSSEY-HCM trial (A Study of Mavacamten in Non-Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT05582395), the largest to date in HCM patients, evaluating the efficacy of mavacamten in symptomatic adults with nHCM, did not demonstrate improvements in its primary endpoints (functional capacity and patient-reported health status).This exploratory analysis of the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated echocardiographic changes in nHCM patients from baseline to week 48.Symptomatic nHCM patients were randomized to placebo or mavacamten (5 mg/d, titrated between 1 and 15 mg based on left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]). Echocardiographic assessments of LV systolic/diastolic function and left atrial (LA) function were performed at baseline and week 48.Among 580 randomized patients (mean age 56 ± 15 years, 45.9% women), baseline measures included LVEF (65.8 ± 4%), maximal LV wall thickness (20.8 ± 4 mm), LV mass index (122.3 ± 31 g/m2), average E/e' (13.3 ± 6), and LV-global longitudinal strain (-13.2 ± 4%). LA parameters included volume index (43.5 ± 16 mL/m2), reservoir strain (19.1 ± 9%), and conduit strain (-11.6 ± 6%). At week 48, there was significant placebo-corrected treatment difference with patients on mavacamten demonstrating significant reduction in maximal LV wall thickness (-2.1 mm [95% CI: -2.5 to -1.7 mm]), LV mass index (-3.8 g/m2 [95% CI: -7.1 to -0.5 g/m2]), and E/e' (-1.3 [95% CI: -2.0 to -0.7]), with a -5.3% [95% CI: -5.9% to -4.1%]; P < 0.01) reduction in LVEF. A reduction in LVEF <50% occurred in 62 patients (21.5%) in the mavacamten arm vs 5 (1.7%) in the placebo arm and recovered following drug interruption. Patients in the mavacamten group maintaining LVEF ≥50% throughout the study (n = 212) demonstrated an improvement in LV-global longitudinal strain at week 48 (-0.4% [95% CI: -0.8% to -0.05%]; P < 0.05). LA functional parameters including contractile (-1.1% [95% CI: -1.8% to -0.4%]) and conduit (-1.4% [95% CI: -0.6% to -2.3%]) strain also improved significantly at week 48 (P < 0.05), whereas LA volume was significantly reduced in patients without atrial fibrillation (-2.6 mL/m2 [95% CI: -4.7 to -1.11 mL/m2]; P = 0.009).Symptomatic nHCM patients treated with mavacamten demonstrated directional improvements in markers of LV diastolic and LA function, modest regression in LV hypertrophy-related parameters, but 1 in 5 demonstrated an LVEF <50%, which reversed following therapy interruption.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

41359838,Mapping epileptogenic brain using a unified spatial-temporal-spectral source imaging framework.,"Noninvasive electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) is a valuable tool for localizing and imaging brain activity, with significant potential to aid presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy (fDRE) patients. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, including interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures, each offer unique capabilities in estimating the epileptogenic zone (EZ). However, there is a limited quantitative understanding of how these biomarkers differ in source-imaging precision, requiring distinct processing pipelines. Here, we developed a spatial-temporal-spectral imaging (STSI) framework for precision source imaging, and quantitatively evaluated various epilepsy biomarkers for source imaging in 2,081 individual events (spikes, HFOs, and seizures) from a cohort of 42 fDRE patients, comparing results to clinical ground truth such as surgical resection outcomes and intracranial EEG-defined seizure onset zones. The STSI enabled quantitative comparisons across key EEG epilepsy-related biomarkers, with averaged localization errors of 6.67 mm for seizures, 8.73 mm for HFOs overlapping with spikes (pHFO), 10.28 mm for HFO-riding spikes (pSpike), 19.59 mm for general spikes (aSpike), and 36.53 mm for general HFOs (aHFO), respectively, for seizure-free patients. These findings indicate that HFOs overlapping with spikes is the most spatially accurate interictal biomarker for mapping the EZ. The proposed STSI framework not only establishes a unified analysis approach for epileptic biomarkers to enhance presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy, but could also generalize as a versatile tool for mapping event-related potentials, neural oscillations, and dynamic brain states, within a single framework to advance cognitive neuroscience research and clinical management of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Dec 16, 2025",2025,Dec,16,Jiang X|Cai Z|Gonsisko C|Worrell G A|He B,Worrell G A,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.","Jiang X, Cai Z, Gonsisko C, Worrell G A, He B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359838/,"The study developed a spatial-temporal-spectral imaging (STSI) framework to precisely map the epileptogenic zone in the brain using various EEG biomarkers, such as interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures.

41075346,The hidden toll: Atrophy of key central nervous system relays in African American women with multiple sclerosis.,"African American persons with MS (AApwMS) have more aggressive clinical and imaging outcomes than White American pwMS (WApwMS), including lower brain and spinal cord (SC) volumes. However, imaging studies are lacking considering the effects of sex, race, and ethnicity together.Compare MS clinical and imaging features among AApwMS and WApwMS, incorporating the modifying effects of sex, race, and ethnicity.Clinical variables and MRI were obtained for AApwMS and WApwMS.Thirty-five MRIs in 28 AApwMS (61 % female) and 255 MRIs in 91 WApwMS (68 % female) were evaluated. AApwMS had a shorter MS disease duration (median 5.9 years, IQR 2.7-13.1) compared to WApwMS (9.4 years, IQR 3.8-17.0; p = 0.034). Fewer AApwMS ever used disease modifying therapy (69 %) compared to WApwMS (92 %; p < 0.001), while the likelihood of having progressive MS and developing severe disability were similar between groups (p > 0.05). AA women with MS had smaller thalamus (p = 0.016), cerebellar grey matter (p = 0.025), and SC-C2 (p = 0.005) volumes than WA women with MS. Although multiple brain and SC regions were smaller in AA men than WA men with MS, the differences were not significant.Interaction between sex, race, and ethnicity may influence differences in imaging metrics of key central nervous system relays, likely preceding clinical worsening in MS.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

41082955,Echocardiographic Predictors of Mortality in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is associated with high mortality in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) patients. We sought to determine the association of Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) parameters with in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the CICU, and found to have PH. We included Mayo Clinic CICU admissions from 2007 to 2018, with a TTE within 1 day of CICU admission demonstrating PH, defined as estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) ≥36 mmHg. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. We included 3085 unique CICU patients with PH by TTE; median age was 73.7 (63.8, 82.4) years, and 1343 (43.5%) were females. Heart failure (65.6%) and respiratory failure (34.0%) were the most common admission diagnoses. The median RVSP was 47 (41, 56) mmHg, and 1314 (42.6%) had RVSP ≥50 mmHg. A total of 337 (10.9%) patients died during hospitalization. The RVSP was higher among in-hospital deaths (51 vs 47 mmHg, p < 0.001), reflecting higher right atrial (RA) pressure (14 versus 10 mmHg, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality increased with higher RA pressure and worse Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery (RV-PA) coupling, such as a lower tricuspid S' velocity to RVSP ratio (AUC 0.72) or higher pulmonary artery elastance (AUC 0.72). In conclusion, in CICU patients found to have elevated pulmonary pressures, several 2D and Doppler TTE parameters predict in-hospital mortality. Specifically, RA pressure and parameters of RV-PA coupling, had highest association with worse outcomes. Early identification of high-risk hemodynamic parameters may facilitate improved investigation, management, and prognostication.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

41141950,Impact and efficacy of sound machine on sleep in hospitalized adults: A systematic review.,"Sleep in hospitalized adults is impaired due to several reasons. Non-pharmacological approaches should be attempted first before considering medications to treat insomnia. Environmental noise levels in the hospital are also a major culprit that might result in disturbed sleep. While limiting any disturbance or sound during sleeping hours is crucial, it might not be completely feasible in the acute care setting. Sound machines that deliver a masking noise such as white noise are reported to mask these environmental noises and promote sleep. We aim to analyze the efficacy and safety of sound machines on sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults.A systematic review of all published literature was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO CINAHL, Google scholar, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to August 13, 2024. All studies that reported sound machine-based interventions on sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults were included. Sleep efficiency and other sleep related outcomes as total sleep time, latency, awakenings, and total sleep score were noted. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 for RCTs was used to evaluate study quality. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024595293).A total of 1920 studies were screened, of which 74 were selected for full text review. Seven RCT studies (n = 496 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were included. Two studies were from USA, and India each, while one study was reported each from Iran, China, and South Korea. Six of the seven studies used white noise, while one study reported using Uncorrelated Signal and Ambient noise in Space Integration (USASI) masking noise. Two studies reported using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) each to measure sleep outcomes. White noise was well tolerated with no major adverse effects reported, and only 8 participants discontinued the study due to discomfort or found it less acceptable. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of improved sleep efficiency with white noise use in hospitalized adults. Given the heterogeneity in the duration of white noise use, inclusion criteria, and the outcome measurement scales in this small sample of RCT studies, meta-analysis was not feasible.White-noise and other similar masking noises seem to improve sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults, with good tolerability. Only limited studies report the efficacy and demonstrate wide heterogeneity in the duration of masking noise use, varied inclusion criteria, and outcome measurement scales. Larger studies analyzing the hospitalized patient population type, across different units, to identify the best patient population who would benefit from these masking sounds are needed.© 2025 The Authors.

41240399,Factors influencing timeliness of reporting results from multiple sclerosis related clinical trials to ClinicalTrials.gov.,"Timely reporting of clinical trial results is both an ethical obligation and a legal requirement under Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA). The law mandates that results from applicable clinical trials be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov within 12 months of the study's primary completion date. We examined reporting compliance among multiple sclerosis (MS)-related randomized controlled trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.Using a previously validated algorithm, we identified highly likely applicable clinical trials (HLACTs) related to MS that were completed or terminated between January 2008 and June 2023. Trial characteristics were extracted, and reporting timeliness was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, logistic regression (12-month reporting), and Cox regression (5-year reporting).Among 298 eligible trials, 64 (21.5 %) reported results within 12 months, while 268 (89.9 %) reported within five years. The reporting half-life was 18 months. Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials were more likely than Phase 4 trials to report within 12 months (OR 5.61, 95 % CI 1.43-23.82; p = 0.015). In contrast, Phase 2 trials were less likely than Phase 4 trials to report within five years (HR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.36-0.89; p = 0.013). Other characteristics, including funding source, intervention type, and enrollment, were not significantly associated with reporting timeliness.Only a minority of MS trials complied with the mandated 12-month reporting deadline, although nearly 90 % reported within five years. Phase-specific differences in compliance highlight potential areas for improvement in trial transparency. These findings may inform future efforts to promote timely reporting, though further research is needed before direct policy implications can be drawn.Copyright © 2024.

41396191,Identifying Potential Carotid Blowout on Post-Treatment Neck Surveillance Imaging.,"Carotid blowout is the rupture of a carotid artery or branch vessel, a dangerous complication in post-treatment head and neck cancer patients. The purpose of this retrospective case review is to identify imaging features suggestive of eminent carotid blowout on routine surveillance post-treatment neck imaging, so that a prompt neuroendovascular consult is obtained and the patient is preemptively treated, thus improving patient outcomes. It is important to carefully interrogate the carotid vessels with appropriate window/leveling for irregularity, adjacent tissue ulceration, exposed vessel to either air or fluid, surrounding tumor, and pseudoaneurysm.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41392146,Clevidipine versus nitroglycerin for blood pressure control during carotid endarterectomy: a cohort study.,"Clevidipine is an ultrafast-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist with selective arteriolar-dilating effects that may be suitable for afterload reduction during surgeries requiring tight blood pressure control. The objective of this single-center retrospective observational study was to evaluate the role of clevidipine to control blood pressure during carotid endarterectomy.Patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy from October 2024 to March 2025 who received clevidipine or nitroglycerin for intraoperative blood pressure management were included. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve of systolic blood pressure excursions outside the predefined target range of 140-160 mmHg. Secondary outcomes included corresponding measurements for mean arterial pressure and heart rate, as well as the incidence of significant clinical complications.Of 40 included patients, 20 received clevidipine and 20 received nitroglycerin. Patients in the clevidipine group spent significantly less time outside the goal systolic blood pressure range than the nitroglycerin group (10 min vs. 37.5 min, p < 0.001). The median normalized area under the curve per five-minute intervals was 29.59 mmHg × min (interquartile range, 15.83 to 49.35) in the clevidipine group versus 60.30 mmHg × min (interquartile range 42.79 to 74.38) in the nitroglycerin group (p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or clinical complications between the groups.Clevidipine was associated with significantly fewer blood pressure excursions outside the target goal range compared to nitroglycerin during carotid endarterectomy.© 2025.

41396675,Development of a novel elastase-induced saccular aneurysm model in rats suitable for testing endovascular devices: An experimental animal study.,"BackgroundAnimal models are essential for evaluating endovascular device safety and efficacy. Rats offer advantages, such as genetic manipulability, lower cost, and shorter healing and breeding cycles, compared to large animals. These features support studying aneurysm healing mechanisms and enable high-throughput testing. We developed an optimal rat aneurysm model for device evaluation.MethodsSaccular aneurysms were created at the origins of the left renal artery (LRA) with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (LRA/ASA group, n = 7); the right common iliac artery (RCIA) with ASA alone (RCIA/ASA group, n = 6) or ASA plus clopidogrel (CLP) (RCIA/ASA + CLP group, n = 7); and the left common iliac artery (LCIA) with ASA + CLP (LCIA/ASA + CLP group, n = 7). The origins of these arteries were surgically exposed. During temporary ligation of the vessel origin, the vessel was bisected and endoluminal elastase was incubated in the proximal stump for 10 min, followed by release of the proximal ligation and permanent ligation of the stump. Angiographical and histological analysis were performed 4 weeks post-procedure.ResultsFollow-up digital subtraction angiography revealed mean ± standard deviation aneurysm height/neck dimensions of 1.2 ± 0.4/1.2 ± 0.1, 2.9/3.1, 2.3 ± 0.6/1.9 ± 0.3, and 2.1 ± 0.6/2.0 ± 0.4 mm for the LRA/ASA, RCIA/ASA, RCIA/ASA + CLP, and LCIA/ASA + CLP groups, respectively. The survival rate was 29%, 17%, 71%, and 86% in the LRA/ASA, RCIA/ASA, RCIA/ASA + CLP, and LCIA/ASA + CLP groups, respectively. Histopathological analysis of these aneurysms confirmed the absence of the internal elastic lamina and revealed aneurysmal changes in the arterial wall, resembling the pathological findings observed in human aneurysm specimens.ConclusionsCommon iliac aneurysm models with ASA + CLP can be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular devices.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Dec 15, 2025",2025,Dec,15,Ueki Y|Bayraktar E A|Ognard J|Hajj G E|Ding Y H|Dai D|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R|Kallmes D F,Ueki Y|Bayraktar E A|Ognard J|Hajj G E|Ding Y H|Dai D|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R|Kallmes D F,"Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Juntendo, Tokyo, Japan.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Univ of Brest, LATIM, INSERM UMR1101, CHU Brest, Brest, France.","Ueki Y, Bayraktar E A, Ognard J, Hajj G E, Ding Y H, Dai D, Rinaldo L, Kadirvel R, Kallmes D F",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41396675/,This study developed a novel rat model of saccular aneurysms by using elastase to induce aneurysm formation.

41397917,"Intergroup Randomized Phase III Study of Adjuvant FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, or 5-FU/Leucovorin for Stage II/III Rectal Cancer: ECOG-ACRIN E3201.","Adjuvant 5-FU monotherapy was previously the standard treatment for stage II/III rectal cancer. This study compared adjuvant FOLFIRI, FOLFOX and 5-FU/LV.Eligible patients had T3-T4 N0 or Tany N1-3 rectal adenocarcinoma ≤12 cm from the anal verge and received pre- or postoperative 5-FU chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients were randomized to adjuvant FOLFIRI (8 cycles), FOLFOX (8 cycles), or 5-FU/LV weekly (6/8 weeks; 3 cycles). The trial planned to enroll 3,150 patients but was closed early following activation of an alternative adjuvant rectal cancer study including bevacizumab (E5204). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS), sphincter preservation, tolerability, and quality of life (QOL).The trial enrolled 225 patients (179 randomized) before early closure. Grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in 59%, with neutropenia, leukopenia, and diarrhea being the most common. At a median follow-up of 9.7 years, no significant OS or DFS differences were observed. The rate of sphincter preservation was numerically higher with FOLFIRI and FOLFOX vs. 5-FU/LV, but the difference was not statistically significant.FOLFOX and FOLFIRI can be safely administered after CRT in rectal cancer patients safely with expected toxicities. Due to early trial closure and small sample size, the survival analysis was underpowered to detect a significant difference between regimens.NCT00068692.© The Author(s) 2025.

41397991,MKK4 and MKK7 control degeneration of retinal ganglion cell somas and axons after glaucoma-relevant injury.,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is a critical component of glaucoma pathology. The degenerative signaling pathways that lead to RGC death in glaucoma are incompletely defined. Recently, the transcription factors JUN and DDIT3 were identified as critical hubs regulating RGC somal loss after mechanical axonal injury. However, their position within the degenerative cascade remains unclear. One possibility is that JUN and DDIT3 activity in the soma initiates signaling events that trigger axonal degeneration. Alternatively, JUN and DDIT3 may function downstream of the primary insult, acting specifically to mediate somal degeneration without influencing axonal pathology. Disentangling these possibilities is critical for understanding the compartment-specific mechanisms of RGC degeneration in glaucoma. The MAP2Ks MKK4 and MKK7 control JNK and JUN activity and can indirectly activate DDIT3. Furthermore, MKK4 and MKK7 have been shown to drive RGC axonal degeneration after mechanical axonal injury. The present work investigated whether JUN and DDIT3, or their upstream activators MKK4 and MKK7, control degeneration of RGC axons and somas after glaucoma-relevant injuries; including ocular hypertension in aged DBA/2J mice and after mechanical axonal injury (controlled optic nerve crush, CONC) in C57BL/6J mice. Ddit3 and Jun deletion did not prevent RGC axonal degeneration in DBA/2J mice but prevented nearly all somal loss. Despite robust somal survival, Ddit3 and Jun deletion did not prevent RGC somal shrinkage or pattern electroretinography (PERG) amplitude decline in DBA/2J mice or after CONC in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, Mkk4 and Mkk7 deletion from C57BL/6J mice significantly lessened RGC soma and axon degeneration while preserving PERG amplitude and soma size after CONC. In summary, activation of MKK4 and MKK7 may be an inciting mechanism governing RGC somal and axonal degeneration after glaucoma-relevant axonal injury.© 2025.

41398033,Mitochondrial RNA cytosolic leakage drives the SASP.,"Senescent cells secrete proinflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), contributing to tissue dysfunction and aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of senescence, influencing SASP via mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and cGAS/STING pathway activation. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) also accumulates in the cytosol of senescent cells, activating RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, leading to MAVS aggregation and SASP induction. Inhibition of these RNA sensors significantly reduces SASP factors. Furthermore, BAX and BAK play a key role in mtRNA leakage during senescence, and their deletion diminishes SASP expression in vitro and in a mouse model of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). These findings highlight mtRNA's role in SASP regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating age-related inflammation.© 2025.

40591976,Diagnosis and Management of Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy.,"The treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), which encompasses cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, has progressed markedly over the past few decades. The natural history of DCM includes multiple phenotypes: a slow deterioration, a stepwise pattern of decline, and rapidly progressive functional decline. Symptoms include gait disturbance, decreased fine motor abilities, weakness, sensory changes, and neck pain. Classically, those with minimal or early symptoms were treated conservatively with observation; however, newer investigations suggest evidence for early surgical treatment. Those with objective myelopathic symptoms confirmed by imaging demonstrating spinal cord compression are indicated for surgery. Surgical treatment can be accomplished with multiple different technical approaches including anteriorly based surgery, posteriorly based surgery, and combined techniques. Traditionally, anterior surgery included anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF), but increasing investigations incorporate cervical disk arthroplasty in this cohort of patients. Historically, laminectomy for posterior decompression was a hallmark of treatment in DCM; however, this led to complications such as postlaminectomy kyphosis and instability which has led to substitution of this treatment by laminoplasty and laminectomy + fusion. Surgical adjuncts such as Riluzole have demonstrated promise in the treatment of DCM patients. Success in surgical treatment is defined by decompression of the spinal cord to halt progression of symptoms and in some patients improve function. Although surgical treatment has yielded success in the treatment of DCM, perioperative complications can be devastating which make surgical technique and patient selection paramount.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Dec 15, 2025",2025,Dec,15,Mechas C|Sarraj M|Helgeson M,Mechas C,"From the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Division of Spine Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Mechas C, Sarraj M, Helgeson M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591976/,"Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a condition that can cause problems with walking, hand function, and neck pain.
