41183253,Natural History and Phenotypic Spectrum of Myofibrillar Myopathies and Myopathies Associated With MFM-Related Genes.,"Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a pathologically defined but genetically heterogeneous myopathy; however, myofibrillar pathology may be absent in some patients with pathogenic variants in MFM-related genes. The natural history of MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes remains poorly characterized.We retrospectively reviewed patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic (January 1993-March 2024) with either pathologically confirmed MFM or myopathies associated with MFM-related genes. Patients without genetic testing or skeletal muscular manifestations were excluded.Eighty patients were identified; 56 were genetically characterized (23 with DES, 10 with MYOT, 9 with LDB3, 2 with FLNC, 2 with BAG3, 2 with CRYAB, 1 with FHL1, and 7 others). Myofibrillar pathology was observed in 60 of 65 biopsied patients. The median age at symptom onset was 42.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20.2-57.0); 66 presented with muscular onset and 14 with cardiac onset. With a median disease duration of 13.1 years (IQR 8.1-24.0) from symptom onset to last visit, all patients had weakness, commonly distal-predominant (n = 34), followed by proximal-predominant (n = 24) and diffuse (n = 11) weakness. Dysphagia occurred in 16 patients, with 4 requiring feeding tubes. Peripheral neuropathy was found in 21 patients (13 with axonal large fiber neuropathy and 8 with small fiber neuropathy), mostly mild in severity. Gait aids were required in 46 patients (median 10.0 years after onset), and 17 became wheelchair-bound (median 19.0 years after onset). By age 60, 67% and 31% of patients with desminopathy required gait aids and were wheelchair-bound, respectively, compared with 12% and 0% of those with myotilinopathy and 25% and 0% of those with LDB3-related myopathy. Cardiac involvement (n = 31) and respiratory involvement (n = 33) were frequent, manifesting at a median of 7 and 9 years, respectively, after myopathy onset. Seven patients (2 with DES, 1 with ACTA1, 4 genetically uncharacterized) died, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications. Patients with desminopathy exhibited earlier and higher rates of cardiac involvement (p < 0.001), more frequent respiratory involvement (p = 0.029), earlier gait aid dependence (p = 0.018) despite a similar age at ambulation loss (p = 0.418), lower prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.022), and a similar mortality rate (p = 1.000).MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes are clinically heterogeneous, with desminopathy showing earlier cardiac manifestations and gait aid requirement and more frequent cardiopulmonary involvement. Given the phenotypic variability, genetic diagnosis is crucial for patient management and prognosis.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Wannarong T|Milone M|Selcen D|Dyck P J B|Liewluck T,Wannarong T,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.","Wannarong T, Milone M, Selcen D, Dyck P J B, Liewluck T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183253/,"This study found that myofibrillar myopathy and related genetic disorders have a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, swallowing difficulties, and heart and lung problems.

41183210,The RANK/RANKL axis controls vascular dynamics in the bone marrow.,"Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is an essential cytokine that induces osteoclastic differentiation by monocyte-macrophage lineage precursors. Here, we showed that in addition to its conventional action, RANKL controls vascular permeability in the bone marrow, where it facilitates the mobilization of hematopoietic monocytic cells, including osteoclast precursors, and resultantly regulates bone metabolism. RANK, a cognate receptor for RANKL, is abundantly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and controls vascular permeability by regulating the expression patterns of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. High RANKL expression was detected in perivascular C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12-abundant reticular (CAR) stromal cells. Specific deletion of RANKL expression in CAR cells abrogated the vascular leakage, suggesting that perivascular RANKL is responsible for controlling permeability. In summary, our study revealed a role for RANK/RANKL signaling as a gatekeeper of bone marrow sinusoids in vivo.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Kaneko T|Yari S|Kikuta J|Omatsu Y|Seno S|Kikuchi S|Sato K|Fujii K|Sudo T|Hasegawa T|Furuta K|Guo Q|Ibrahim S H|Muraoka K|Okada Y|Kubota Y|Okuzaki D|Kobayashi Y|Kumanogoh A|Udagawa N|Nagasawa T|Penninger J M|Ishii M,Furuta K|Guo Q|Ibrahim S H,"Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Respiratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|World Premier International Research Center Initiative Immunology Frontier Research Center, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka 567-0085, Japan.|Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Bioinformatic Engineering, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Anatomy, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.|Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Biochemistry, Matsumoto Dental University, Nagano 399-0704, Japan.|Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Lower Saxony 38124, Germany.|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna 1090, Austria.|Department of Medical Genetics, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.|Life-omics Research Division, Institute for Open and Transdisciplinary Research Initiative, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.","Kaneko T, Yari S, Kikuta J, Omatsu Y, Seno S, Kikuchi S, Sato K, Fujii K, Sudo T, Hasegawa T, Furuta K, Guo Q, Ibrahim S H, Muraoka K, Okada Y, Ishii M, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183210/,"This research found that the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway, which is important for bone formation, also controls the permeability of blood vessels in the bone marrow.

40899684,Modern Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Formulas Outperform Direct Methods in Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia and Low Levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.,"Direct measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is widely used and recommended by professional society guidelines despite its potential limitations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low LDL-C. This study evaluated the performance of 3 direct LDL-C (LDL-CD) assays, 2 modern LDL-C calculation methods [LDL-C Martin (LDL-CM), LDL-C modified Sampson (LDL-CS)] and the conventional Friedewald (LDL-CF) method against the reference method, beta-quantification (LDL-CBQ).A total of 181 remnant sera from patients with standard lipid panel orders or from patients with LDL-CBQ orders with triglycerides (TG) ≥ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L), or with TG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L) and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) were included. LDL-CD and lipid panel data were gathered from Abbott Alinity, Roche Cobas, and Siemens Atellica platforms.LDL-CD among the 3 platforms showed a median CV of 11.2%. In patients with TG <400 mg/dL, LDL-CM and LDL-CS demonstrated less bias and less misclassification at the clinical decision LDL-C levels than LDL-CF or LDL-CD. In the 400 to 800 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) TG group, LDL-CS was superior to LDL-CD or LDL-CM in accuracy. When TG is ≥ 800 mg/dL, LDL-CD (Roche) showed substantial bias from LDL-CBQ while LDL-CS (Roche) showed smaller but significant bias.In summary, LDL-CD or LDL-CF showed little advantage over the 2 modern LDL-C calculation methods. LDL-CS showed the best overall correlation with LDL-CBQ and therefore is recommended to replace LDL-CF and potentially LDL-CD when making clinical decisions in patients with low LDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.

40878676,Microvascular Endothelial Cells License APS Vasculopathy Through YAP1- and CCN2-Mediated Signaling.,"Whereas antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is best known for increasing the risk of macrovascular thrombosis, APS vasculopathy is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to occlusion of small blood vessels in the skin, kidneys, and heart, among other organs. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and targeted treatment options for patients with APS are lacking.To identify and analyze APS microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), skin biopsies of patients with APS complicated by livedo racemosa were characterized using single-cell RNA sequencing. CCN1 (cellular communication network factor 1) and CCN2 were identified in skin and kidney biopsies by immunofluorescence microscopy and in plasma by ELISA. Healthy dermal MVECs were cultured with APS patient-derived serum or immunoglobulin G (IgG), and relevant signaling pathways were characterized using quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells were determined after exposure to conditioned medium from APS IgG-stimulated MVECs. A mouse model of APS IgG-accelerated neointima formation was developed. Anti-CCN2 monoclonal antibodies were tested in vascular smooth muscle cell functional assays and the mouse model.Increased endothelial cell expression of CCN1 and CCN2 was identified by single-cell RNA sequencing and further confirmed in APS skin by microscopy as well as in APS plasma by ELISA. Exposure of healthy MVECs to patient IgG triggered the upregulation of CCN1 and CCN2 via Toll-like receptor 4- and YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1)-mediated signaling. CCN2, originating from APS IgG-stimulated MVECs led to the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, phenotypes that were inhibited by an anti-CCN2 antibody or depletion of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). We further observed increased expression of CCN2, along with evidence of YAP1 nuclear translocation, in kidney vessels of APS nephropathy biopsies. Finally, CCN2 inhibition with an anti-CCN2 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced neointima thickening and cell proliferation in a mouse model of APS IgG-accelerated neointima formation.This study revealed activation of YAP1-mediated signaling in APS dermal microvessels and demonstrated that the YAP1 target CCN2 plays a role in facilitating pro-proliferative communication between MVECs and vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings offer insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying APS vasculopathy, providing potential therapeutic targets for patients.",Circulation,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Shi H|Liang W|Yang Z|Hoy C K|Wang Q|Ding Z|Pan H|Shi Y|Shen Y|Sarosh C|Yalavarthi S|Kapoor P|Hudgins L|Vance C E|Wasikowski R|Figueroa-Parra G|Tambralli A|Madison J A|Tsoi L C|Gudjonsson J E|Yang C|Duarte-García A|Zuo Y|Billi A C|Tsou P|Knight J S,Figueroa-Parra G|Duarte-García A,"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Ruijin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (H.S., Z.Y., Z.D., H.P., C.Y.).|Departments of Internal Medicine (H.S., W.L., C.K.H., Y.

40850932,Post-Translationally Modified Proteoforms as Biomarkers: From Discovery to Clinical Use.,"Protein biomarkers are routinely measured for disease diagnosis and prognosis in clinical laboratories. Since most assays focus on protein quantity, information about proteoforms is often not acquired. Proteoforms of a protein represent the complex integration of genetic polymorphism, alternative splicing of RNA transcripts, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the amino-acid backbone. A detailed analysis of the post-translationally modified proteoforms (PTMPs), which are influenced by pathophysiological conditions, may lead to more precise diagnosis and prognosis.This article first discusses the methodologies used to accurately detect and characterize PTMPs, i.e., immunoassays, electrophoresis, chromatography, and intact and proteolysis-aided mass spectrometry techniques. Then it reviews specific examples of PTMP biomarkers that have been successfully translated from biomarker discovery to clinical use. The examples include β2-transferrin for cerebrospinal fluid leak diagnosis, phosphorylated tau proteoforms for Alzheimer disease diagnosis, and fucosylated alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis. In addition, the article provides prospective views of novel analytical technologies and promising new PTMP biomarkers entering clinical practice.In summary, PTMs are controlled by biochemical processes to modulate the functions of proteins by expanding their chemical diversity. PTM alterations in proteins can be indicators for pathophysiological conditions. Advances in analytical technologies are deepening our understanding of PTMPs and paving the way for their translation to clinical use. As research continues to discover the clinical meaning of PTMP biomarkers, they are poised to become valuable additions to the clinical testing menu for precision medicine.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.

40629956,A Modified Sampson-NIH Equation with Improved Accuracy for Estimating Low Levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol.,"Cardiovascular guidelines have long recommended low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary target for lipid-lowering therapy. Recent guidelines have emphasized the importance of achieving low LDL-C levels; hence, the accurate measurement of low LDL-C is increasingly clinically relevant.Using lipid panel test results from the Mayo Clinic (n = 24 590) and the FOURIER clinical trial of evolocumab (n = 9605), the following modified Sampson equation was developed by least-squares regression to match LDL-C (mg/dL) by the β-quantification reference method, by combining terms into non High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (nonHDLC = Total Cholesterol - High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) and forcing the coefficient to be one.The modified Sampson equation demonstrated significant improvement in its concordance to the reference method compared to other equations (the Lin Concordance Correlation Coefficient 0.992, P < 0.001). By overall kappa analysis, it showed the best agreement to the reference method at the 55 mg/dL cutpoint (1.4 mmol/L, 0.98 [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 0.96, Martin-Hopkins: 0.96, Friedewald: 0.94) and the 70 mg/dL cutpoint (1.8 mmol/L, 0.97 [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 0.94, Martin-Hopkins: 0.95, Friedewald: 0.92). The false classification rate of the modified Sampson equation was also significantly lower compared to the other equations at 55 mg/dL (15%, [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 29%, Martin-Hopkins: 28%, Friedewald: 37%) and 70 mg/dL (18%, [P < 0.001]; Sampson-NIH: 30%, Martin-Hopkins: 28.%, Friedewald: 34%). The new equation increases the percentage of correctly classified patients with low LDL-C by approximately 10% to 20% over the other equations based on its net reclassification index.The modified Sampson equation shows improved accuracy compared to other equations for low LDL-C. It more accurately identifies high-risk patients, who are not at their LDL-C goals and could benefit from more intensive lipid-lowering therapy.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.",Clinical chemistry,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Sampson M|Zubiran R|Wolska A|Meeusen J W|Donato L J|Jaffe A S|Melloni G E M|Giugliano R P|Sabatine M S|Marston N A|Remaley A T,Meeusen J W|Donato L J|Jaffe A S,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.|Lipoprotein Metabolism Laboratory, Translational Vascular Medicine Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|TIMI Study Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.","Sampson M, Zubiran R, Wolska A, Meeusen J W, Donato L J, Jaffe A S, Melloni G E M, Giugliano R P, Sabatine M S, Marston N A, Remaley A T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40629956/,"The study developed a modified Sampson equation that more accurately estimates low levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to other equations.

41067915,7T MRI Automated Software Segmentation of the Hippocampus for Epilepsy: Prospective Performance Evaluation.,"7T MRI is a promising clinical technology for epilepsy imaging. Quantification of hippocampus volume on MRI is a clinically useful biomarker in epilepsy. Applying automated hippocampus volume measurement tools to 7T MRI is needed to optimize the use of clinical ultra-high-field strength epilepsy imaging. The objective of this study is a performance evaluation of automated hippocampal volume measurement software at 7T MRI in both normal participants and those with seizure disorders.7T MRI examinations were prospectively acquired in 50 participants. A subset of participants also underwent 3T MRI examinations, and a subset underwent 2 separate 7T acquisitions. Automated segmentation of the hippocampus was performed with 2 commonly used software packages (FreeSurfer and NeuroQuant) at 3T and 7T, with hippocampal volumes calculated for segmentations without any visually unacceptable errors as determined by radiologist review. Hippocampal volumes were also measured from manual segmentations, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare data with automated segmentation volumes.Visually unacceptable automated hippocampus segmentation errors occurred more frequently at 7T than at 3T with NeuroQuant (11.0% versus 7.14%) and FreeSurfer (12.5% versus 0%). Computerized volume measurements at 7T correlated poorly with manual segmentation for both software programs (ICC <0.4). Hippocampal volume estimate correlation between matched 7T and 3T MRI in the same participant was fair (ICC = 0.4-0.59) to good (0.6-0.75) for software and manual segmentation. For repeated 7T MRI examinations in the same participant, hippocampus segmentation reproducibility was excellent (0.75) for automated software but poor (< 0.4) for manual segmentation.Computerized volume measurement of the hippocampus at 7T correlates poorly with volumes obtained through manual segmentation and suboptimally with matched 3T examination measurements, but is highly reproducible at 7T within the same participant. Segmentation errors are more common with 7T examinations, and further development of a hippocampal segmentation method specific to 7T MRI is needed to fully realize the benefits of 7T MRI for imaging patients with epilepsy.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41178593,Occurrence and predictors of patient reported fertility discussions in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients: utilizing the lymphoma epidemiology of outcomes (LEO) cohort study.,"Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), especially younger individuals, can face fertility risks from treatment. We assessed rates and predictors of fertility counseling and preservation in this population. The LEO cohort prospectively enrolled newly diagnosed NHL patients (2015-2020) at eight U.S. academic centers. We assessed responses to a 3-year survivorship questionnaire in those aged 18-50 at diagnosis; logistic regression evaluated predictors of fertility counseling.

41178536,Performance of Large Language Models in Analyzing Common Hypertension Scenarios.,"Hypertension, the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, remains suboptimally controlled. Large language models (LLMs) could improve hypertension control by augmenting clinical decision-making, but their reliability for guideline-driven tasks is unverified. This study evaluated the accuracy and safety of hypertension management recommendations generated by 3 LLMs.Fifty-one vignettes were constructed and submitted to the LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Medical Large Language Model [by Google; MedLM]) and a hypertension expert to generate the responses. Three blinded reviewers rated each response on a 4-point accuracy scale, a binary safety (safe/unsafe) scale, and attempted to identify the source (LLM versus expert) providing the response.GPT-4 had the highest accuracy (83%) and safety (86%) scores among LLMs but remained inferior to expert responses (92% accuracy, 93% safety). Gemini and MedLM performed significantly worse (accuracy: 64% and 35%; safety: 73% and 39%, respectively). GPT-4 generated the most guideline-concordant responses (46%) among the 3 LLMs (Gemini 35%, MedLM 14%) but was lower than expert responses (68%). Interrater reliability for accuracy ratings was higher for LLM-generated responses (GPT-4 [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.30], Gemini [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.61], and MedLM [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.58]), with lower agreement for expert responses (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.23). A similar pattern was observed for safety and source discrimination ratings. The agreement was strongest for safety assessments and weakest for source discrimination.Among the 3 tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrated closer agreement to expert decisions, thereby showing greater potential for supporting hypertension management. Despite their potential, current LLM versions are inferior to expert recommendations. Human-in-the-loop supervision remains essential when deploying LLMs for clinical decision-making.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Zand J|Miao J|Hommos M S|Schwartz G L|Taler S J|Nejat P|Cheungpasitporn W|Garovic V D|Zoghby Z M,Zand J|Miao J|Hommos M S|Schwartz G L|Taler S J|Nejat P|Cheungpasitporn W|Garovic V D|Zoghby Z M,"Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Previous studies have shown clinical improvement with USPFD, but pain relief and patient satisfaction have not been demonstrated beyond 2 years.This retrospective case series included patients who underwent USPFD at a quaternary academic medical center between April 2013 and January 2018, with refractory plantar fasciopathy and at least 4 years' follow-up. Patient outcomes were assessed through electronic surveys and telephone interviews. Primary outcome measures included mean changes in visual analog scale pain (VAS-Pain) scores and patient satisfaction via Likert scale. Secondary measures included VAS-Pain with the first 5 steps, VAS-Pain during daily weightbearing, and procedural complications.Seventy unique procedures were identified among 62 patients. Follow-up data were obtained from 51 of 62 patients (82%) who responded to surveys or phone calls. This corresponded to 58 of 70 procedures (83%) at a mean postprocedure follow-up of 6.6 ± 1.4 years. Patients had a mean duration of symptoms of 2.1 ± 3.0 years prior to the procedure. Baseline VAS-Pain was 6.8 ± 2.2 and final follow-up VAS-Pain was 0.7 ± 1.1. At the last follow-up, patient-reported VAS-Pain with first 5 steps was 0.9 ± 1.6 and VAS-Pain with weightbearing through the day was 1.3 ± 1.8. Overall, 91% (53/58) of the procedures were considered successful, where patients responded they were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" and 52 of 58 (90%) procedural responses indicated that based on the outcome, they would recommend the procedure to others. Final follow-up VAS-Pain, VAS-first 5 steps, and VAS-weightbearing, were all improved in the success vs failure groups (P ≤ .002).

Among YAs with complete 7-month data (n = 1,829), 40.8% were Exclusive E-cigarette Users and 59.2% were Dual Users at baseline. Primary analyses examined the proportion of participants who were Dual Abstinent at 7-months by treatment arm differences. We also examined for interaction effects between baseline product use and vaping status at 7 months on cannabis use outcomes.At 7-months, adolescent categories of use were: Dual Abstinent, 31.7% (95% CI: 28.8, 34.6); Exclusive E-cigarette Users, 18.2% (95% CI: 15.9, 20.7); Exclusive Cannabis Users, 15.1% (95% CI: 12.9, 17.4); Dual Users, 35.0% (95% CI: 32.1, 38.1). Among YAs: Dual Abstinent, 15.6% (95% CI: 13.9, 17.3); Exclusive E-cigarette Users, 29.4% (95% CI: 27.3, 31.6); Exclusive Cannabis Users, 12.8% (95% CI: 11.3, 14.5); Dual Users, 42.2% (95% CI: 39.9, 44.5). Intervention outperformed Control in promoting rates of Dual Abstinence among adolescents (38.5% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.0001) and YAs (17.9% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.007).

40709833,Off-pore Nucleoporin sPOM121 Transcriptionally Propels β-Catenin-driven Tumor Progression and Immune Escape in Prostate Cancer.,"The roles of nucleoplasm-residing nucleoporins (NUP) in solid tumors, including prostate cancer, remain unknown. In this study, we reveal the clinical significance and mechanistic role of the off-pore NUP, soluble POM121 (sPOM121), as a crucial transcriptional regulator that enhances the aggressiveness of metastatic prostate cancer. Using orthogonal methodologies in human samples, sPOM121 was identified as the predominantly expressed nucleoplasmic NUP in prostate cancer. Unbiased proteomic and epigenomic studies demonstrate that sPOM121, through its C-terminus, interacts with the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 at gene promoter sites and localizes at nuclear condensates, reprogramming gene expression. Indeed, sPOM121 regulates a distinct oncogenic gene network, including β-catenin, leading to prostate cancer progression and immune evasion. Importantly, targeting the sPOM121/β-catenin axis in patient-derived preclinical and syngeneic mouse models halts prostate cancer aggressiveness and enhances antitumor immunity. Taken together, these findings reveal previously unknown actionable reprogramming functions of off-pore NUPs in solid tumors.This study uncovers how oncogenic signaling programs are transcriptionally heightened by the NUP sPOM121 in metastatic prostate cancer. Localization of sPOM121 at active transcriptional nuclear condensates propels disease progression and immune evasion, offering novel anticancer therapeutic opportunities.©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",Cancer discovery,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Kirthika P|Jawalagatti V|Li P|Xu M|Carceles-Cordon M|Ertel A|Quinn S A|Petrylak D P|Orme J J|Dehm S M|Antonarakis E S|Heath E I|Pandey M K|Cordon-Cardo C|Huang H|Dong H|Zhu S|Domingo-Domenech J|Rodriguez-Bravo V,Kirthika P|Jawalagatti V|Carceles-Cordon M|Orme J J|Heath E I|Pandey M K|Huang H|Dong H|Domingo-Domenech J|Rodriguez-Bravo V,"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Department of Medical Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.|Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Pathology, Tisch Cancer Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.|Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Kirthika P, Jawalagatti V, Li P, Xu M, Carceles-Cordon M, Ertel A, Quinn S A, Petrylak D P, Orme J J, Dehm S M, Antonarakis E S, Heath E I, Pandey M K, Cordon-Cardo C, Huang H, Rodriguez-Bravo V, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40709833/,"The key finding of this study is that the nucleoporin sPOM121 plays a crucial role in driving the progression and immune evasion of metastatic prostate cancer. sPOM121 interacts with chromatin remodelers and regulates an oncogenic gene network, including β-catenin, leading to more aggressive disease.

40828413,Genomic and Immune Landscape of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Associated with Germline Pathogenic Variants in ATM.,"Germline pathogenic variants (PV) in ATM increase the risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the underlying tumor biology of PDAC associated with germline PV in ATM has not been adequately explored.Whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing were performed on PDAC tumors from 25 germline ATM PV carriers diagnosed at Mayo Clinic between 2007 and 2017. Somatic and copy-number alterations, mutational signatures, transcriptomic subtypes, and the immune landscape were evaluated.High-quality whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were obtained from 21 and 15 tumors, respectively. Biallelic inactivation of ATM was observed in 87%, KRAS PV in 90%, CDKN2A homozygous loss in 60%, and TP53 alterations in <10% of these tumors. A predominant clock-like mutational signature was present in all samples. Whole-transcriptome analysis identified that the aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine subtype accounted for 18% of PDAC and was consistently associated with >5-year overall survival. In addition, a 28-gene expression-based signature associated with overall survival was identified and further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. Immune landscape analysis through CODEX identified enriched CD4 T-helper cell/tumor interactions and reduced B7H3-high cell/tumor interactions in ATM PV carriers compared with noncarriers.The observed absence of TP53 PV and enrichment for CDKN2A alterations in ATM tumors, along with differences in the mutational signatures, transcriptomic subtypes and immune landscape, improve our understanding of the mechanistic pathways involved in PDAC development in germline ATM PV carriers and help identify potential targeted therapeutic strategies.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Yadav S|Bao R|Graham R P|Hu C|Hart S N|Na J|Boddicker N|Gnanaolivu R D|Smadbeck J|Ding L|Billadeau D D|Mayer A T|Majumder S|Morais Lyra P C|Lee A V|Monteiro A N|Villasboas J C|McWilliams R|Couch F J,Yadav S|Graham R P|Hu C|Hart S N|Na J|Boddicker N|Gnanaolivu R D|Smadbeck J|Ding L|Billadeau D D|Majumder S|Villasboas J C|McWilliams R|Couch F J,"Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Veracyte Inc., San Francisco, California.|Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Enable Medicine, San Francisco, California.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Cancer Epidemiology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.|Institute for Precision Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Yadav S, Bao R, Graham R P, Hu C, Hart S N, Na J, Boddicker N, Gnanaolivu R D, Smadbeck J, Ding L, Billadeau D D, Mayer A T, Majumder S, Morais Lyra P C, Lee A V, Couch F J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40828413/,"This study found that pancreatic cancer in people with a genetic mutation in the ATM gene has distinct features, including a lack of TP53 mutations, a predominant mutational signature, and differences in immune cell interactions.

It inhibits ribosome biogenesis and causes organelle stresses, leading to selective immunogenic cell death in cancer cells. The possibility of PT-112's pyrophosphate moiety driving high drug concentrations to bone sites of disease has led to an interest in PT-112's use in multiple myeloma. In this study, we present findings from phase I and in vivo studies for PT-112 in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.PT-112 biodistribution was analyzed in mice via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The activity of PT-112 was assessed in de novo and transplantable Tg(Igkv3-5*-MYC)#Plbe (Vk*MYC) multiple myeloma mouse models as monotherapy or combination therapies. M-spike levels and survival were measured. A phase I dose escalation study of PT-112 monotherapy was conducted using a 3 + 3 design in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with exhausted available therapies.In vivo biodistribution imaging revealed high concentrations in the bone, kidney, lung, skin, and liver. PT-112 was active in Vk*MYC multiple myeloma mouse models, both alone and in combination. Phase I data showed that PT-112 monotherapy was safe and well-tolerated, establishing a recommended phase II dose of 360 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Confirmed responses and other signals of activity were observed.These results suggest a lack of cross-resistance with the standard of care and support the translational value of the Vk*MYC model system.

Total work relative value units (wRVUs) and wRVUs for BI studies were summed, and year-specific BI case mixes were calculated per radiologist. Radiologists interpreting more than 50% of their case mix as BI each year were classified as subspecialized breast radiologists. Productivity and subspecialization trends overall and by imaging modality were evaluated.From 2013 to 2022, BI wRVUs increased by 7.8% annually, and radiologists performing BI services decreased by 2.2% annually. The percentage of all radiologists submitting BI claims decreased from 46.5% to 34.2%. The number of subspecialized breast radiologists submitting claims for BI services increased by 7.1% annually. The percentage of all radiologists who were breast subspecialized increased from 8.1% in 2013 to 13.4% in 2022. BI wRVUs by subspecialized breast radiologists increased by 15.1% annually. Beginning in 2017, more BI wRVUs were performed by subspecialized breast radiologists than by <50% BI mix radiologists.

40668133,IRF4 Promotes Immune Evasion and Shapes the Tumor Microenvironment in Follicular Lymphoma.,"Twenty percent of patients with follicular lymphoma relapse early with poor outcomes; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this aggressive behavior are unknown. Using a multiomic approach, we show that patients with follicular lymphoma with elevated IRF4 expression (IRF4hi) have increased transformation risk, dysregulated immune signaling, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in IRF4hi lymphoma cells, along with chromatin profiling, demonstrate that IRF4 impairs their interaction with T cells by repressing antigen presentation and co-receptor gene modules while promoting the expression of cytokines that antagonize T-follicular helper cell and regulatory T-cell functions. Additionally, IRF4 rewires tumor metabolism and restricts glucose availability to immune cells. Silencing of IRF4 inhibits tumor cell growth and restores immune surveillance mechanisms, thus representing a promising target for therapy. Our data suggest that IRF4hi lymphoma cells co-opt a developmental mechanism used to exit the germinal center response in promoting a more aggressive cancer via engagement of multiple immune-evasive mechanisms.We show that IRF4 controls immune and metabolic signaling with functional effects on the cross-talk between B and T cells, resulting in a suppressive immune microenvironment when IRF4 is overexpressed in lymphoma.

40556502,Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 6 mRNA Lipid Nanoparticles Ignite Antitumor Immunity and Suppress Tumorigenesis in Ewing Sarcoma.,"Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer that has remained refractory to current therapeutics. Immunotherapy has been unsuccessful in Ewing sarcoma, largely due to poor understanding of how its immune tumor microenvironment is regulated. We recently demonstrated that ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6) can remodel the Ewing sarcoma immune landscape to engender an antitumorigenic tumor microenvironment. USP6 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells enhances surface expression of immunostimulatory ligands and receptors and induces production of multiple chemokines, driving recruitment and activation of tumor-suppressive immune lineages, including NK cells. We sought to harness this multifaceted immunostimulatory function into a novel therapeutic by delivering in vitro transcribed USP6 mRNA via ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with USP6 mRNA in vitro is capable of inducing the aforementioned antitumorigenic and immunostimulatory responses. In addition, USP6 mRNA-treated Ewing sarcoma cells elicit cytolytic activation of primary human CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and NK cells in vitro. Intratumoral delivery of USP6 mRNA LNPs suppresses growth of Ewing sarcoma xenografts, coincident with increased immune infiltration and activation. We further demonstrate that USP6 mRNA is capable of igniting an immunostimulatory program in other cancer types (including acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and osteosarcoma) in vitro and suppressing acute myeloid leukemia xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment with USP6 mRNA LNPs was well-tolerated, with no observed gross toxicity. Together, these preclinical studies provide proof-of-concept for the immunogenic and antitumorigenic efficacy of USP6 mRNA LNPs and support its promise as a novel immunotherapeutic in diverse cancer types.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Henrich I C|Billingsley M M|Jain K|Mondal S|Quick L N|Young R|Nguyen N|Oliveira A M|Blobel G A|Mitchell M J|Chou M M,Oliveira A M,"Merlin Biotech/Baruch S.

40541529,Intraplaque Hemorrhage Volume and Ischemic Stroke Risk.,"Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) in carotid atherosclerotic plaques is the best established biomarker of plaque vulnerability. However, the relationship between IPH volume and ischemic neurologic symptoms remains scarcely studied. This study explored the association between carotid IPH volume and ischemic event severity.A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients with suspected carotid atherosclerosis evaluated from December 2015 to January 2021. Patients underwent carotid plaque MRI using T1-weighted imaging with fat suppression for IPH detection. Included patients had documented neurologic symptoms, classified as amaurosis fugax (AF), TIA, and/or stroke. MRI scans were reviewed for presence and volume of IPH, with semiautomated software used for volumetric segmentation. Statistical analyses, including Mann-Whitney U tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, were performed to evaluate IPH volume thresholds and their association with symptom severity.The study included 358 patients, of whom 69 had IPH-positive carotid plaques. A higher incidence of ischemic events was noted on the left side, with 28 strokes, 6 AF, and 12 TIAs observed in left-sided events, and 19 strokes, 1 AF, and 3 TIAs in right-sided events. No substantial differences in IPH volumes were found across symptom categories or event laterality. ROC analysis identified IPH volume thresholds with area under the curve values of 0.579 (0.396, 0.748) for left-sided events and 0.618 (0.333, 0.910) for right-sided events, indicating limited discriminatory power for predicting ischemic event severity.While carotid IPH volume is detectable across various neurologic symptom categories, our findings indicate that IPH volume alone does not significantly correlate with ischemic event severity. Threshold IPH volumes showed low diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that other plaque characteristics and systemic factors may be more relevant in determining ischemic stroke risk.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41182009,Admixture Mapping of Lipid Traits in Hispanic Americans.,"Admixture mapping can be leveraged to identify genomic loci associated with disease traits in admixed individuals such as Hispanic Americans.We characterized fine-scale population structure of participants (n=105 108) in the multiethnic eMERGE-III (electronic Medical Records and Genomics) cohort, using reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project and a Native American cohort. We defined ""genetically admixed Hispanic Americans"" as those having ≥10% Native American genetic ancestry (n=5025), in addition to European (specifically, Iberian) and African genetic ancestry. This population descriptor was subsequently applied to 3 other cohorts: the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; n=1176), WHI (Women's Health Initiative; n=2873), and the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos; n=7804). We inferred local ancestry along the genome in genetically admixed Hispanic Americans in each cohort using RFMix2 with phased haplotypes from SHAPEIT2. Local ancestry proportions were used for admixture mapping of lipid traits (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) using extended linear mixed models that incorporated multiple or single ancestries. After accounting for fixed-effect covariates and random effects, ancestry proportions at the following loci were associated with lipid traits in the HCHS/SOL cohort: 11q12.2 (P=6.8×10-7) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2p23.3 (P=5.2×10-7) with total cholesterol, and 11q23.3 (P=7.3×10-12) with triglycerides. The LDL cholesterol and triglyceride loci replicated in at least one independent cohort, whereas the total cholesterol locus showed suggestive evidence for replication in the eMERGE cohort (P=0.073). Native American (NAMR) ancestry appeared to drive the LDL-C association, whereas both NAMR and Iberian population in Spain (IBS) ancestries contributed to the triglyceride signal.Admixture mapping in genetically admixed Hispanic Americans identified genomic loci influencing lipid traits and the different ancestral origins driving these associations.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Ding K|Johar A S|Zaidi A|Crane P K|Velez Edwards D R|Jarvik G P|Karlson E W|Rosenthal E A|Stanaway I B|Weng C|Schaid D J|Kullo I J,Ding K|Johar A S|Schaid D J|Kullo I J,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Rochester MN.|Institute for Health Informatics University of Minnesota Minneapolis MN.|Department of Medicine University of Washington Medical Center Seattle WA.|Division of Quantitative Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN.|Department of Medicine Brigham and Women's Hospital Boston MA.|Department of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences Mayo Clinic Rochester MN.|Gonda Vascular Center Mayo Clinic Rochester MN.","Ding K, Johar A S, Zaidi A, Crane P K, Velez Edwards D R, Jarvik G P, Karlson E W, Rosenthal E A, Stanaway I B, Weng C, Schaid D J, Kullo I J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182009/,"This study used admixture mapping to identify genetic regions associated with lipid traits, such as cholesterol and triglyceride levels, in Hispanic Americans.

41182409,Postoperative Lymph is a Proximal Source of ctDNA for Detection of Recurrence in HPV-independent Head and Neck Cancer.,"Relapse is a major cause of failure in human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Clinicopathologic criteria for adjuvant treatment remain imprecise and have not changed for decades. We investigated whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (""lymph"") 24-hours after surgery identified molecular residual disease (MRD) and compared its performance to time-matched plasma.Using an ultra-sensitive tumor-informed sequencing approach, tumor variants were called in lymph and plasma to classify patients as ctDNA-positive or ctDNA-negative, trained in an initial cohort of 36 patients and replicated in an independent cohort of 37 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared in ctDNA+ vs. ctDNA- patients.Lymph identified MRD in two independent multi-site cohorts (initial cohort sensitivity= 76%, specificity= 63%, log-rank P= 0.01; replication cohort sensitivity= 65%, specificity= 70%, log-rank P= 0.04). Lymph performance was enhanced in locoregional relapse (sensitivity= 78%, specificity= 67%, log-rank P= 0.0004) and generalized to early-stage patients. Analysis of matched plasma collected at this early timepoint was not predictive of recurrence (sensitivity= 35%, specificity= 72%, log-rank P= 0.7). In patients with intermediate-risk pathology, lymph ctDNA was associated with recurrence (sensitivity= 88%, specificity= 67%, log-rank P= 0.0008), suggesting an opportunity for improved stratification of patients who may benefit from additional adjuvant treatment.Postoperative lymph is a novel, proximal, and early source of MRD with the potential to introduce more precision into adjuvant therapy decision-making and improve outcomes, especially for intermediate-risk HPV-independent HNSCC patients.",Clin Cancer Res,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Lazare S|Gu Z|Earland N|Harmon M A|Pacula M|Rivera M|Tellis A|Whitfield D|Benson A|Gerndt S|Harris P|Khalil L|Ramirez R|Xu Z|Wahle B|Puram S|Adkins D|Thorstad W|Zandberg D|Chernock R|Skinner H|Spector M E|Seethala R|Ferris R L|Smith J D|Greer A E|Verner E L|Georgiadis A|Sausen M|Ramkissoon S H|Jensen T J|Francis M S|Winckler W|Chaudhuri A A|Zevallos J P,Chaudhuri A A,"Droplet Biosciences, Inc, Cambridge, MA, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States.|Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, United States.|Mercy Hospital Springfield, Springfield, MO, United States.|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.|Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, United States.|UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, United States.|University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.|University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.|UPMC Health System, United States.|Labcorp, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.|LabCorp (United States), Baltimore, MD, United States.|Labcorp Oncology, Baltimore, United States.|LabCorp (United States), Baltimore, Maryland, United States.|Labcorp Burlington, Durham, NC, United States.|LabCorp (United States), Durham, NC, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.","Lazare S, Gu Z, Earland N, Harmon M A, Pacula M, Rivera M, Tellis A, Whitfield D, Benson A, Gerndt S, Harris P, Khalil L, Ramirez R, Xu Z, Wahle B, Zevallos J P, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182409/,"This study found that analyzing circulating tumor DNA in lymphatic fluid collected after surgery can better detect the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with head and neck cancer, compared to analyzing blood samples.

41182321,2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.© 2025 American College of Rheumatology.",Arthritis care & research,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Sammaritano L R|Askanase A|Bermas B L|Dall'Era M|Duarte-García A|Hiraki L T|Son M B F|Werth V P|Aranow C|Barnado A|Broder A|Brunner H I|Chong B F|Chowdhary V R|Hersh A O|Izmirly P M|Jules M|Kalunian K|Kamen D|Rubinstein T B|Smith B J|Smith N M|Thomas A|Timlin H|Wallace D J|Azzam M|Bartels C M|Cunha J S|DeQuattro K|Fava A|Figueroa-Parra G|Garg S|Gomes L L A|Cuéllar-Gutiérrez M C|Iyer P|Johannemann A S|Jorge A|Kasturi S|Kawtharany H|Khawandi J|Legge A|Liang K P|Lockwood M M|Sanchez-Rodriguez A|Turgunbaev M|Williams J N|Turner A S|Mustafa R A,Duarte-García A|Figueroa-Parra G|Cuéllar-Gutiérrez M C|Sanchez-Rodriguez A,"Hospital for Special Surgery Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.|Columbia University, New York, New York.|University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.|University of California, San Francisco.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|University of Pennsylvania and Corporal Michael J.

41182325,A Qualitative Analysis of Patient Perspectives and Preferences in Lupus Management to Guide Lupus Guidelines Development.,"A patient-centered approach for chronic disease management, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), aligns treatment with patients' values and preferences, leading to improved outcomes. This paper summarizes how patient experiences, perspectives, and priorities informed the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2024 Lupus Nephritis (LN) and 2025 SLE screening, treatment guidelines.We completed a cross-sectional qualitative study using content analysis of two Patient Panel meetings for the ACR LN and SLE guidelines. Key themes were presented by Patient Panel representatives during Voting Panel Meetings along with evidence for each recommendation, to ensure comprehensive discussions and align treatment recommendations with patients' priorities and values.Nineteen people (90% women) with diagnoses of SLE and/or LN participated in the Patient Panels and 17 consented to use their feedback for analysis. Thematic analysis of their discussions revealed nine patient-reported key themes in three domains: (1) treatment and monitoring of LN and SLE: medication side effects, daily function, treatment goals, and monitoring and screening; (2) clinical communication: strategies to optimize communication and provider and structural impediments to effective communication; and (3) improving transparency and information sharing: clinical trial participation, and medical costs and insurance coverage. These themes were actively incorporated into discussions during the Voting Panels for the ACR LN and SLE guidelines.This work supported the integration of patient experiences in the clinical practice guideline development process and aligned recommendations with real-world patient experiences and priorities, thereby enhancing the clinical applicability of the ACR LN and SLE guidelines.© 2025 The Author(s).

41182414,Baseline demographic and aneurysm morphologic features associated with woven endobridge angiographic outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an effective treatment for wide-neck aneurysms (WNA). This study aims to identify and compare anatomical and procedural factors that predicts the aneurysm occlusion, both adequate and inadequate after WEB device treatment.A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, including studies up to October 25, 2024. Data on angiographic outcomes of WEB occlusion were extracted and analyzed using R version 4.4.2.Nine studies (790 patients) were included. Female patients were 1.64 times more likely to achieve adequate occlusion than males (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.52], P = 0.026). Regular-shaped aneurysms had a 2.44-fold higher likelihood of adequate occlusion compared to irregular ones (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: [0.23, 0.74], P = 0.003). Aneurysm neck size was significantly smaller in the adequate occlusion group (3.9 mm vs. 4.4 mm, MD: -0.48 mm, 95% CzI: [-0.78, -0.18], P = 0.002). Maximum aneurysm diameter was also smaller in the adequate occlusion group (5.7 mm vs. 6.8 mm, MD: -1.13 mm, 95% CI: [-1.69, -0.57], P < 0.001). Aneurysm height was also significantly lower than the inadequate occlusion group (5.4 mm vs. 6.3 mm, MD: -0.92 mm, 95% CI: [-1.55, -0.29], P = 0.004).Smaller aneurysm dimensions, regular shape, and female sex were associated with higher adequate occlusion rates after WEB treatment. These findings may guide patient selection strategies for optimizing aneurysm occlusion. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these associations.© 2025.

41182464,Immunotherapy for Metastatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors with High Mutational Burden and Mismatch Repair Alterations Following Treatment with Alkylating Chemotherapy.,"Alkylating agent-based chemotherapy is one of the main treatment options for patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs).However, it favors the acquisition of a hypermutator phenotype, suggesting a potential benefit of immunotherapy.We aimed to describe the efficacy of immunotherapy in an international retrospective cohort of patients with metastatic well-differentiated PanNETs pretreated with alkylating therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the main secondary endpoint was the radiological objective response rate (ORR). We explored the impact of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), and evaluated variables associated with PFS.We included 64 patients with heavily pretreated PanNETs (median Ki-67 28%). Among 51 PanNETs with mutational profiling, 37 (73%) were TMBhigh (median 35 mut/Mb). Among 46 PanNETs with available MMR status, 18 (39%) were MMRd, representing 49% of all TMBhigh PanNETs. Immunotherapy consisted of a single (31%) or a dual (69%) immune checkpoint inhibitor. Median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 1.3-5.0.3.0) and the ORR was 17%. Patients with TMBhigh PanNETs had longer PFS (median 3.8 vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.015) and higher ORR (30% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) compared with TMBlow/unk cases. Patients with MMRd PanNETs had longer PFS (median 8.9 vs. 2.7 months, p = 0.003) and higher ORR (44% vs. 7%, p < 0.001) compared with MMRp/unk. On multivariable analyses, MMRd predicted longer PFS (HR 0.42, 95% CI [0.20-0.82], p = 0.015).Overall, immunotherapy may be effective against alkylating-pretreated metastatic PanNETs exhibiting TMBhigh and MMRd. MMR immunohistochemistry and TMB assessment could be implemented in the routine assessment of alkylating-pretreated metastatic PanNETs.© 2025.

41182766,Assessment of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy With Ovarian Function Suppression by Breast Cancer Index.,"The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) previously identified premenopausal patients with tumors in which the ratio of expression of HOXB13 relative to IL17BR (hereafter, BCI [H/I]-low tumors) as likely to derive greatest benefit from ovarian function suppression (OFS)-containing adjuvant therapy in the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) trial.To assess BCI as a predictive biomarker of benefit from exemestane plus OFS vs tamoxifen plus OFS and to validate BCI as a prognostic biomarker for premenopausal patients.This prognostic study used a prospective-retrospective translational design within the Tamoxifen and Exemestane (TEXT) and SOFT trials (enrolled November 2003 to April 2011). Blinded BCI testing in all available tumor samples was completed in March 2024. Premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer randomized to tamoxifen plus OFS or exemestane plus OFS who had BCI assessed were included. Analysis occurred from March to August 2024.5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen plus OFS or exemestane plus OFS.The primary outcomes were breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) for predictive analyses and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) for prognostic analyses after a median follow-up of 13 years in the TEXT cohort. Secondary objectives examined the predictive performance of BCI (H/I) in the combined TEXT and SOFT cohort overall and in prespecified clinical subgroups.Of 1782 patients in the TEXT study, 1034 (58.0%) had BCI (H/I)-low tumors; 915 (51.3%) of patients had N0 disease and 1077 (60.4%) were younger than 45 years. Patients with BCI (H/I)-low tumors had a 6.6% absolute benefit in 12-year BCFI (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85) for exemestane plus OFS vs tamoxifen plus OFS, while those with BCI (H/I)-high tumors had a 6.3% absolute benefit (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.07; P for interaction = .29). Results were consistent in the combined TEXT plus SOFT cohort (2896 patients) and adjusting for clinicopathological variables. Clinical subgroup analyses consistently showed benefit of exemestane plus OFS vs tamoxifen plus OFS for BCI (H/I)-low tumors, and more variable relative treatment effects among BCI (H/I)-high tumors, including by age. Post hoc exploratory time-varying estimates suggested the treatment × BCI associations may differ in years 0 to 5 vs greater than 5 years. BCI and BCI N+ as continuous indices were prognostic for distant recurrence in N0 (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.44; P < .001) and N1 (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.21-2.05; P < .001) cancers. The 12-year DRFI was 96.3%, 90.3%, and 84.9% for BCI low-, intermediate-, and high-risk N0 cancers, respectively.In this study of premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, BCI (H/I) status did not clearly predict greater benefit of adjuvant exemestane plus OFS vs tamoxifen plus OFS for women with BCI (H/I)-low tumors than for those with BCI (H/I)-high tumors; BCI continuous indices were reconfirmed as prognostic for premenopausal women. These findings support prior results of SOFT, which compared tamoxifen-alone vs OFS with either exemestane or tamoxifen, indicating premenopausal patients with BCI (H/I)-low tumors may benefit from more intensive endocrine therapy.",JAMA network open,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,O'Regan R M|Ren Y|Zhang Y|Siuliukina N|Schnabel C A|Kammler R|Viale G|Dell'Orto P|Munzone E|Láng I|Tondini C|Gomez H L|Chini C|Nicoletti S V L|Puglisi F|Zaman K|Goetz M P|Stearns V|Martino S|Salim M|Loibl S|Geyer C E|Bonnefoi H R|Ciruelos E M|Loi S|Colleoni M|Fleming G F|Francis P A|Walley B A|Pagani O|Treuner K|Regan M M,O'Regan R M|Goetz M P,"Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.|IBCSG Statistical Center, Division of Biostatistics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Biotheranostics, A Hologic Company, San Diego, California.|International Breast Cancer Study Group, ETOP IBCSG Partners Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.|International Breast Cancer Study Group Central Pathology Office, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.|Division of Medical Senology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.|Clinexpert-Research, Budapest, Hungary.|Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.|Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas, Lima, Peru.|Deaprment of Medical Oncology, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale dei Sette Laghi, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi, Varese, Italy.|Department of Medical Oncology, Ospedale Infermi Rimini, Ausl Romagna, Italy.|Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.|Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Pordenone, Italy.|Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research, Bern, Switzerland.|Department of Medical Oncology, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.|Mayo Clinic Department of Oncology, and Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, Rochester, Minnesota.|Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York.|The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Santa Monica, California.|SWOG Cancer Research Network, San Antonio, Texas.|Allan Blair Cancer Center, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.|German Breast Group Forschungs GmbH, Neu-Isenburg, Germany.|Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|NSABP Foundation, NRG Oncology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Institut Bergonié, Université de Bordeaux Collège Sciences de la santé, INSERM U1312, Bordeaux, France.|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.|Medical Oncology Department, University Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.|SOLTI Breast Cancer Research Cooperative Group, Barcelona, Spain.|Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne Australia.|The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Medical Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.|The University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, Australia.|St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.|Breast Cancer Trials Australia and New Zealand, Newcastle, Australia.|University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|Canadian Cancer Trials Group, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.|Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.|Lugano University, Lugano, Switzerland.|Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.","O'Regan R M, Ren Y, Zhang Y, Siuliukina N, Schnabel C A, Kammler R, Viale G, Dell'Orto P, Munzone E, Láng I, Tondini C, Gomez H L, Chini C, Nicoletti S V L, Puglisi F, Regan M M, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182766/,"This study assessed the Breast Cancer Index (BCI) as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of ovarian function suppression (OFS) with exemestane versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

41182767,Validation of 4 Risk Stratification Tools for Delirium in the Emergency Department.,"Validation of prognostic tools is an essential component of their integration into clinical practice.To validate 4 delirium risk stratification tools in an independent emergency department (ED) cohort.This prognostic study included a retrospective cohort of patients 65 years or older who presented to an academic ED between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2024. Data were analyzed from February 10 to August 21, 2025.Delirium screening included the Delirium Triage Screen followed by the brief Confusional Assessment Method as part of the standard of care. Four delirium risk scores were obtained, including the Kennedy rule, the Zucchelli rule, the Mayo Delirium Prediction (MDP) tools, and the Recognizing Delirium in Emergency Medicine (REDEEM) score.Main outcomes included risk score performances and diagnostic test accuracy measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) with 95% CIs. Secondary outcomes were discriminative and calibration measures.A total of 44 578 patients were included, of whom 1701 (3.8%) were diagnosed with delirium. The median age was 80.0 (IQR, 75.0-85.0) years, and 22 786 patients (51.1%) were female. The Kennedy rule had an AUROC of 0.777 (95% CI, 0.766-0.789).

41182787,"Burden of Central Nervous System Cancer in the United States, 1990-2021.","Primary brain and central nervous system cancer (collectively referred to as CNS cancer) comprises 2% of all human cancers and poses significant health and economic challenges in the United States.To analyze CNS cancer burden in the US, stratified by time, location (state and division), sex, age group, and Sociodemographic Index (SDI).This cross-sectional study involved a repeated analysis of Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 data in 2024. Using data from 183 sources, CNS cancer metrics in the US were estimated across states and years. US CNS cancer metrics across all sexes and age groups were included in the GBD.CNS cancer diagnosis.Overall and age-standardized estimates of the incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years lived with disability per 100 000 population, including 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), and time trends.In 2021, for all age groups and sexes across the US, there were 31 780 incident cases (95% UI, 29971.1 to 32843.9). Age-standardized incidence, DALYs, and mortality rates per 100 000 population were 6.91 (95% UI, 6.58 to 7.12), 134.38 (95% UI, 129.83 to 137.95), and 4.1 (95% UI, 3.87 to 4.22), respectively. Despite no significant change observed in the overall incidence between 1990 and 2021, DALY and mortality rates decreased by 15.77% (95% UI, -17.75% to -13.68%) and 8.41% (95% UI, -11.09% to -6.22%), respectively. Substantial geographic variability was noted. Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, and Kansas (West North Central and East South Central divisions) and West Virginia faced persistently high burdens over the past 30 years. Sex differences were evident; disease burden was consistently higher in males compared with females. Age-specific estimates showed a bimodal distribution: the youngest group (<5 years) showed a significant decrease in incidence rate (-34.42% to -11.56%), whereas older age groups (>70 years) experienced increasing trends. DALYs and mortality rates were negatively correlated with SDI (ρ = -0.6860 and ρ = -0.6391; P < .001).These findings provide valuable insights into the CNS cancer burden across the US by age, sex, location, and SDI, enabling better public health status assessments, health care policy restructuring, and resource redistribution for improved care.",JAMA neurology,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Han H J|Kim Y S|Park S|Shin J I|Kim M S|Moon J H|Kim Y B|Ababneh H S|Abu-Zaid A|Areda D|Arul S|Azzam A Y|Bardhan M|Bayat Tork M A|Behnam B|Bilgin G B|Bhardwaj P V|Bhuyan S S|Lomer N B|Chen M X|Chennapragada S S|Dai X|Dean F E|Deekonda S|Ding X|Doshi O P|E'mar A R|Elhadi M|Fares J|Fazeli P|Fisher J L|Fotouhi M|Gholamrezanezhad A|Ida F|Iwu C D|Jalloh M|Jani C T|Kalani R|Kankam S B|Kazemi F|Keshwani A|Khosla A A|Lim S S|Mehboob R|Mestrovic T|Mokdad A H|Murray C J L|Naik G|Natto Z S|Nguyen D|Nugen F|Orscelik A|Parikh R R|Penberthy L|Pestell R G|Prabhu D|Puvvula J|Ramasamy S K|Sabet C J|Schumacher A E|Senol Y C|Sham S|Sherchan S P|Simegn G L|Singh J A|Solanki R|Srichawla B S|Taiba J|Tanwar M|Amirikah M T|Verma A|Yunusa I|Zheng D X|Yon D K|Park K Y,Bilgin G B|Nugen F,"Department of Neurosurgery, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.|Department of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.|Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.|Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.|Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.|Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.|College of Graduate Health Sciences, University of Tennessee, Memphis.|College of Art and Science, Ottawa University, Surprise, Arizona.|School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe.|Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco.|ASIDE Healthcare, Lewes, Delaware.|Faculty of Medicine, October 6 University, 6th of October City, Egypt.|Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida.|Biological Science Division, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.|Avicenna Biotech Research, Germantown, Maryland.|Department of Regulatory Affairs, Amarex Clinical Research, Germantown, Maryland.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Springfield.|Department of Health Administration, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.|Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.|School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|Department of Hematology-Oncology, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana.|Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle.|Department of Health Metrics Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.|Department of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley.|Department of Pediatrics, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York.|Joe C.

41182964,Predictive modeling of long-term improvement in occlusion outcomes following Woven EndoBridge treatment of cerebral aneurysms: A machine learning approach.,"BackgroundThe Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device represents an innovative solution for cerebral aneurysm occlusion, particularly for challenging wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. However, factors affecting sustained occlusion remain poorly understood. We utilized machine learning to attempt to identify predictors of favorable long-term outcomes following WEB treatment.MethodsIn this multicenter retrospective study, we collected patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was improvement in occlusion status, defined as maintained Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) grade 1, or improvement from grade 2 to 1, or from grade 3 to either 2 or 1 on final angiographic follow up. The dataset was split into training (75%) and validation (25%) sets. The CatBoost algorithm was selected based on performance metrics, with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values calculated to determine feature importance. Furthermore, a multivariable binomial logistic regression model was performed to validate machine learning findings.ResultsAmong 720 aneurysms from 36 hospitals, 84% showed improvement in occlusion at follow up. Both machine learning and multivariable logistic regression identified aneurysm height as the most consistent correlate of nonimprovement (odds ratio (OR) 0.90 per mm, p = 0.022). In the CatBoost model, the highest-ranking features by SHAP included aneurysm height, patient age, treatment acuity, ACom location, WEB-SLS device, bifurcation anatomy, aneurysm multiplicity, baseline modified Rankin Scale, access route, and partial thrombosis.ConclusionsMachine-learning and regression analyses identified consistent predictors of occlusion improvement after WEB treatment, with aneurysm height most strongly linked to nonimprovement. These insights may guide patient selection and follow up. Findings require cautious interpretation and external validation in larger cohorts.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Karandish A|Essibayi M A|Jabal M S|Salim H A|Musmar B|Adeeb N|Dibas

41183146,Targeting the ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 Axis Overcomes Genotoxic Therapy Resistance in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, primarily due to its robust resistance to genotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance is essential to improve clinical outcomes. Here, we identified trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), previously known for its role in RNA modification, as a critical mediator of homologous recombination (HR) repair that specifically contributes to resistance in PAAD. TGS1 was significantly overexpressed in PAAD tissues, correlating strongly with advanced disease stages, therapy resistance, and poor patient prognosis. Following DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylated TGS1 at serine residues S389 and S531, which mediated its direct interaction with BRCA1 and subsequent recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction enhanced HR repair efficiency, enabling cancer cells to survive genotoxic stress. Depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TGS1 induced HR deficiency and markedly enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, particularly PARP inhibitors, in PAAD cell lines in vitro and in both cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover an ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 signaling axis that promotes DNA repair and resistance to genotoxic therapies in pancreatic cancer, positioning TGS1 as a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to enhance treatment efficacy.",Cancer research,"Nov 03, 2025",2025,Nov,03,Li C|Zhao X|Li X|Wang C|Huo Z|Xu X|Kang W|Nowsheen S|Aziz K|Sun G|Liu Z|Lou Z|Deng M,Lou Z,"Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.|Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, Beijing, China.|Shandong Provincial QianFoShan Hospital, China.|Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China, China.|National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, Beijing, China.|The Iowa Clinic, Waukee, IA, United States.|The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, United States.|National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, China.","Li C, Zhao X, Li X, Wang C, Huo Z, Xu X, Kang W, Nowsheen S, Aziz K, Sun G, Liu Z, Lou Z, Deng M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183146/,"The key finding of this research is that the protein TGS1 plays a critical role in helping pancreatic cancer cells resist DNA-damaging therapies like chemotherapy and radiation.

41183370,Bridging the Physician Knowledge Gap in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Breast Imaging Care.,"Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face unique challenges in accessing affirming, evidence-based breast imaging care because of longstanding disparities in provider education, institutional practices, and imaging guidelines. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, such as chest masculinization or breast augmentation, impact breast tissue composition and cancer risk, necessitating individualized imaging approaches. Through multiple clinical vignettes, this article illustrates potential pitfalls and key considerations in breast imaging for TGD patients, including appropriate imaging recommendations, inclusive system-level changes, and navigating patient encounters. Education of breast imaging radiologists, technologists, and front-desk staff is critical to bridge the known knowledge gap and improve outcomes for this patient population. By adopting inclusive, culturally competent, and trauma-informed practices, breast imaging professionals can help reduce disparities and improve the experience and health outcomes of TGD patients.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.

41184595,Amivantamab-Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertions: Impact of Treatment Crossover and Other Endpoints from the Phase III PAPILLON Study.,"In the PAPILLON study, first-line amivantamab-chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion-mutated non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival and favorable overall survival over chemotherapy; a consistent benefit was also observed across some secondary endpoints. However, the complete clinical benefit of first-line amivantamab-chemotherapy is not fully understood, nor is the survival advantage in the presence of per-protocol crossover from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression.We aimed to assess time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and time to subsequent therapy (TTST), at the time of primary analysis for progression-free survival, and the effect of the crossover design on overall survival at the time of interim analysis.In the phase III PAPILLON study, 308 participants were randomized (amivantamab-chemotherapy, n = 153; chemotherapy, n = 155). Intravenous amivantamab was administered every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered as carboplatin for four cycles and pemetrexed until disease progression. TTD and TTST were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Crossover-adjusted survival estimates were generated using three established statistical methods.At a median follow-up of 14.9 months, median TTD was 13.2 versus 7.5 months for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38 [95% confidence interval 0.28-0.51]; nominal p < 0.0001). Median TTST was 17.7 versus 9.9 months (HR 0.35 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.49]; nominal p < 0.0001). A total of 65/155 participants crossed over from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression. The crossover-adjusted overall survival continued to demonstrate a favorable survival benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with HRs of 0.52-0.60, which is more pronounced than the planned interim intention-to-treat overall survival (HR of 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.09).In PAPILLON, TTD and TTST were substantially longer for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy at primary analysis (cut-off on 3 May 2023). Crossover-adjusted analyses of the planned interim overall survival demonstrated a greater benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, further supporting amivantamab-chemotherapy as the first-line standard of care in EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04538664.© 2025.

40379458,Transvenous Embolization versus Surgical Intervention for CSF Venous Fistulas: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The efficacy and safety profiles of surgical and embolization techniques for CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) are not well-defined because of limited data and a lack of randomized trials.This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment and transvenous embolization for CVFs in patients with SIH.PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to September 2024.Clinical studies involving adults with confirmed CVFs, treated either surgically or through transvenous embolization, were included. End points analyzed included headache response, overall symptom resolution, radiologic treatment response, and complications. Meta-analyses were performed by using R software, applying random-effects models to calculate prevalence rates and their 95% CIs. Subgroups of surgery and embolization were compared by using the χ2 test. The quality of the studies was assessed by using appropriate checklists.""Endpoints analyzed included headache response, overall symptom resolution, radiologic treatment response, and complications. Meta-analyses were performed using R software, applying random effects models to calculate prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroups of surgery and embolization were compared using Chi-squared test. The quality of the studies was assessed using appropriate checklists.""Fifteen studies involving 321 patients and 354 CVFs were included, all of good quality. Both treatment modalities led to over 90% partial or complete headache response, with no significant difference between embolization (93.9%; 95% CI: 88.3% to 96.9%) and surgery (90.1%; 95% CI: 75.6% to 96.4%) (P = .43). Overall symptom resolution (complete response) was also comparable between embolization (59.1%; 95% CI: 50.5% to 67.1%) and surgery (70.7%; 95% CI: 44.7% to 87.8%) (P = .38). Radiologic response, measured by the Bern score, showed significant improvement postembolization, with no corresponding data from surgical literature. The retreatment/recurrence rate was 14% (95% CI: 9.9% to 19.3%), with no significant difference between embolization (15.3%; 95% CI: 10.3% to 22.1%) and surgery (11.3%; 95% CI: 5.7% to 20.9%) (P = .63). There was no publication bias among the reported end points.Lack of direct comparative effectiveness and small sample sizes heighten the risk of selection and confounding bias.Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both surgical treatment and transvenous embolization for CVFs in patients with SIH provide comparable efficacy and safety profiles. Future research should employ uniform definitions, standardized radiologic and clinical end points, and long-term follow-up to more rigorously evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of these approaches.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.
