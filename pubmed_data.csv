41476411,2026-01-01,Purified Exosome Product Enhances Tendon-Bone Healing in a Rat Rotator Cuff Repair Model.,"Tendon-bone healing after rotator cuff injury is, or remains, a clinical challenge.To examine the role of intraoperative use of purified exosome products (PEPs) in the treatment of rotator cuff injuries and to assess the effect of PEP on supraspinatus tendon-bone healing after rotator cuff repair in a rat model.Controlled laboratory study.This study used 120 Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent an acute supraspinatus tendon transection from the insertion, followed by repair using a single transosseous suture. They were divided into 3 groups: a control group that received only sutures, a TISSEEL group that used a commercially available fibrin sealant patch (TISSEEL) of approximately 0.5 cm2, and a PEP-TISSEEL group that used a similarly sized TISSEEL patch combined with PEP. Autopsies were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 8 weeks after surgery. Analyses were performed using molecular biological, biomechanical, and histological techniques.At 6 weeks, the PEP-TISSEEL group achieved greater failure load (mean, 27.5 ± 5.3 N) than the control (mean, 16.4 ± 4.2 N; P = .012) and TISSEEL (mean, 23.4 ± 5.0 N; P = .041) groups, with superiority persisting at 12 weeks (27.2 ± 6.5 N vs 13.1 ± 2.6 N [P = .002] for the control group and 21.1 ± 5.8 N [P = .037] for the TISSEEL group). DigiGait showed earlier recovery of stride length and paw angle. Histology revealed organized collagen and reduced scarring, while molecular assays demonstrated early inflammatory modulation with subsequent upregulation of collagen type 1 or 3 and TGF-β, supporting accelerated tendon-bone healing.Intraoperative application of PEP-TISSEEL enhanced tendon-bone healing in a rat model by improving biomechanical strength, promoting enthesis-specific histological regeneration, and accelerating functional recovery as evidenced by gait analysis.The intraoperative application of PEP combined with TISSEEL significantly enhances rotator cuff tendon healing by modulating early inflammation, promoting collagen synthesis, and improving biomechanical properties in a rat model. These findings suggest that PEP-based therapies could offer a promising adjunct in surgical repair, potentially reducing retear rates and improving functional outcomes in patients with rotator cuff injuries.

This study examined whether a special product made from exosomes (tiny structures released by cells) could help improve healing after rotator cuff surgery in a rat model. The researchers divided 120 rats into three groups: one received only stitches to repair the tendon, another got a commercial fibrin sealant patch, and the third group got the sealant patch plus the exosome product. Over 8 weeks, the researchers analyzed the strength of the repaired tendon, how well the tendon and bone healed together, and the rats' movement and gait. They found that the group receiving the exosome product had significantly stronger tendon repairs and better healing between the tendon and bone compared to the other groups. The exosome treatment also led to faster recovery of normal movement. These findings suggest that using exosome-based therapies during rotator cuff surgery could help improve healing and reduce the risk of the tendon tearing again, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.

40921325,2026-01-01,Endovascular Treatment Protocol for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Ten-Year Experience.,"To investigate whether endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), performed whenever anatomically feasible, would be superior in a real-world registry.Retrospective analysis of consecutive RAAA patients treated at the emergency department of a single hospital from January 2011 to December 2023, after implementation of protocol-based care. The variables of interest were hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and type of intervention. The outcomes were 30-day mortality and long-term survival. Statistical analyses were conducted using the chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Pearson correlation. Logistic regression was used to construct a propensity score for matching, and survival rates were illustrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.Among 209 treated patients, anatomical location included infrarenal, isolated iliac, and juxta-renal aneurysms. Endovascular repair was performed in 121 patients (57.9%), with a significant difference in proximal neck length compared to the open repair group (median 19.7 mm vs. 7.9 mm, P < 0.001). Hemodynamic instability was present in 39% at admission. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 44%; endovascular repair was associated with lower mortality (34.7%, P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval: 0.263-0.431) before matching. Factors such as kidney failure, hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and morphology were significantly associated with mortality outcomes. However, propensity score matching (PSM, 42 pairs) revealed no statistical superiority of either technique.While initial analysis indicated lower 30-day mortality in the endovascular group, PSM revealed no significant difference in either 30-day or long-term mortality between endovascular and open repair when anatomically feasible. Intervention choices should be tailored based on individual anatomical circumstances, the expertise of the medical team, and the resources at hand. Our propensity score analysis was the first to consider anatomical features; nevertheless, endovascular repair demonstrated no clear superiority to open repair.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge or weakening in the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. When this aneurysm ruptures, it can cause severe internal bleeding and is a medical emergency. 

The researchers looked at 209 patients treated for RAAA at a single hospital over 10 years. They compared two surgical options: open repair, where the abdomen is opened to directly fix the aneurysm, and endovascular repair, a less invasive procedure where a stent is inserted through the blood vessels to seal the aneurysm. The researchers analyzed factors like the patients' stability, the anatomy of the aneurysm, and the type of surgery performed. They found that while initial results suggested lower 30-day mortality with endovascular repair, when accounting for differences in patient characteristics, there was no clear advantage of one surgical approach over the other. The choice of treatment should be tailored to each patient's unique"
40988507,2026-01-01,Incorporating Machine Learning Driven Factors in the Design of Electronic-triggers to Detect Diagnostic Errors in the Emergency Department.,"Electronic health records (EHR)-based triggers (eTriggers) have been used to study diagnostic errors in the emergency department (ED), often with suboptimal performance. Our objective was to investigate incremental value of multi-factor machine learning (ML) approaches to improve eTrigger performance.Patients presenting to an academic ED were categorized into trigger-positive and trigger-negative using standard trigger (T) definitions: (T1) ED return visits resulting in admission within 10 days; (T2) care escalation from the inpatient unit to the ICU within 24 hours; and (T3) deaths within 24 hours of admission. We trained and evaluated 6 supervised ML models.A total of 124,053 consecutive encounters (5791 T-positive and 118,262 T-negative) were included. Among the T-positive, 4159 (72%) were associated with T1, 1415 (24%) with T2, and 217 (4%) with T3. The T-based positive predictive values (PPV) were 5.2% for T1, 8.2% for T2, and 6.5% for T3. ML models trained and evaluated on balanced training dataset and imbalanced test set had low classification performances (accuracy: 0.72-0.95; PPV: 0.00-0.16; F1-score: 0.00-0.23). Higher performances were observed in balanced test sets (accuracy: 0.80-0.97; PPV: 0.82-1.00; F1-score: 0.79-0.97). Comparing models trained on clinically annotated data with models trained on T-based labels identified other important factors.Utilizing machine learning to refine e-triggers slightly improves the identification of diagnostic errors, as evidenced by an increase in PPV values. We identified new potential factors contributing to ED diagnostic errors. These findings open new avenues to construct or modify more accurate e-triggers for diagnostic error identification.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Diagnostic errors can have serious consequences for patient health, so finding ways to identify them early is important. The researchers tested different machine learning models to see if they could enhance the performance of existing ""trigger"" systems that flag potential errors based on factors like hospital readmissions and patient deaths. 

They analyzed over 124,000 emergency department visits, training the machine learning models on a subset of the data. The models were able to identify potential diagnostic errors with higher accuracy and reliability than the standard trigger systems, especially when the training and testing data were well-balanced. The researchers also discovered new factors that may contribute to diagnostic errors in emergency care, opening up new avenues for improving error detection. 

While more research is needed, this study demonstrates the potential for advanced analytics to enhance patient safety by catching diagnostic mistakes early on. By leveraging the wealth of data in EHR systems, healthcare providers can develop smarter tools to monitor for issues and intervene before they escalate. Ultimately, this could lead to better outcomes and reduced harm for emergency department patients."
40984676,2026-01-01,Transitional Fracture Patterns of the Pediatric Distal Radius.,"Distal radius fractures involving the physis are among the most common upper extremity injuries in children and adolescents. Unlike transitional fractures of the distal tibia, known as Tillaux and triplane fractures, transitional fractures of the distal radius have not been well characterized. This study aims to evaluate Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius in the pediatric transitional age population to determine if a characteristic fracture pattern exists analogous to the distal tibia. We hypothesized that pediatric transitional fractures of the distal radius would follow a pattern that would ultimately dictate treatment and predict outcomes.A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with transitional fractures of the distal radius at a single institution was performed. Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius with CT imaging were included. Two independent reviewers determined the metaphyseal fracture plane and the major intra-articular epiphyseal fracture fragments. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.Thirty patients who met inclusion criteria made the study cohort. There were 5 Salter-Harris III fractures and 25 Salter-Harris IV fractures. Mean age at the time of injury was 15±1.5 years. The metaphyseal fracture demonstrated a coronal fracture plane in all cases, and 20% had a sagittal plane component. The major epiphyseal fracture fragments were identified as dorsal ulnar corner in 70%, radial column in 43%, volar rim in 30%, and dorsal wall in 17%. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (N=12, 40%), closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (N=4, 13%), or cast immobilization (N=14, 47%). Most patients (N=24, 80%) did not demonstrate a growth disturbance after treatment. Angular deformity, however, was significantly higher in patients with a primary dorsal ulnar corner epiphyseal fragment (N=4, 19% vs. N=0%, P =0.03).Transitional fractures of the distal radius occurred on average at age 15. The injuries demonstrated a consistent pattern, with a coronal fracture plane in the metaphysis and a dorsal ulnar corner fragment in most epiphyses. The dorsal physis may be the strongest portion of the distal radius at the time of injury, though mechanism of injury may impact patterns as well.Level III.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This research aimed to better understand the patterns of these fractures in the pediatric population. The researchers reviewed medical records and X-rays of 30 children with these types of wrist fractures. They found that these injuries typically occur around age 15 and follow a consistent pattern - the break in the bone occurs in a specific way, with a fracture line running across the width of the bone and a fragment breaking off the back of the wrist joint. Most patients did not have long-term growth problems after treatment, which often involved surgery to realign the bones. However, those with a larger fragment on the back of the wrist were more likely to develop an angular deformity. This study provides important insights that can help doctors better understand, diagnose, and treat these common yet complex pediatric wrist injuries, leading to improved outcomes for young patients."

PH1 causes the body to produce too much oxalate, which can build up in the kidneys and lead to kidney stones and kidney damage over time. 

The researchers analyzed urine samples and medical records from over 300 PH1 patients to see how the level of oxalate in the urine changed as their kidney disease progressed. They found that as CKD stage increased, the amount of oxalate excreted in the urine also went up. This suggests that measuring urine oxalate could be a useful way to monitor kidney function in PH1 patients and help guide treatment. 

Understanding the connection between oxalate levels and kidney disease is important for improving care and outcomes for people with PH1. By tracking oxalate excretion, doctors may be able to identify kidney problems earlier and intervene before too much damage occurs. However, more research is still neede"

The authors respond to two previous papers that discussed different approaches to diagnosing and treating this complex condition. 

The researchers did not conduct a new study, but rather analyzed the arguments and evidence presented in the previous papers. They considered whether it is better to base patient care on the limited scientific data that is available, or to rely more on expert opinions and good intentions when evidence is lacking. 

The key finding is that while expert opinions can be valuable, the authors believe it is ultimately better to make treatment decisions based on the existing scientific evidence, even if it is imperfect. They argue that this approach is more likely to lead to effective, evidence-based care that improves outcomes for patients with hepatorenal syndrome. 

This debate has important implications, as it highlights the challenges of providing high-quality care when the medical research is incomplete. The authors' perspective suggests that clinicians should strive to use the best available evidence, while also acknowledging its limitations and continuing to pursue further research to fill the gaps.

40972771,2026-01-01,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 β Hepatocyte Deletion Attenuates Ferroptosis and Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis in Mice.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is characterized by toxic lipid-induced cellular stress (lipotoxicity), which culminates in lethal and sublethal hepatocyte injury and a sterile fibroinflammatory response. We previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) ameliorates murine MASH. However, the hepatocyte-specific role of GSK3β in lipotoxic injury and the fibroinflammatory response in MASH remains unclear.We generated hepatocyte-specific Gsk3β knockout (Gsk3βΔHep) mice by crossing Gsk3βfl/fl mice with albumin-Cre mice. Mice were fed either a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD) or a high-fat, fructose, and cholesterol (FFC) diet to induce MASH.Metabolic parameters and hepatic lipidomic were similar between FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep and Gsk3βfl/fl mice. The NanoString Metabolic Pathways Panel on liver tissues showed upregulation of NAD, mitochondrial function, and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep mice compared with Gsk3βfl/fl mice. In vitro studies in palmitate-treated hepatocytes showed that mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis, contact with lipid droplets, and respiration were improved, whereas mitochondrial DNA release and Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) phase separation were reduced with pharmacological GSK3 inhibition or in hepatocytes isolated from Gsk3βΔHep mice. Similarly, liver injury, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis markers, and circulating mitochondrial DNA levels were reduced in Gsk3βΔHep mice with MASH. Furthermore, Gsk3βΔHep mice with MASH had reduced hepatic expression of proinflammatory genes, myeloid cell infiltration, NETosis, and showed significant downregulation of fibrosis signaling pathways.Gsk3βΔHep reduced liver injury, mitochondrial DNA release, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with MASH, secondary to improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduced ferroptosis. Therefore, GSK3β may be a potential therapeutic target for human MASH.Copyright © 2026 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although FDS have proven successful in treating aneurysms that would previously have required complex microsurgical or endovascular repairs, treatment failures remain a concern. In this multicenter study, we aim to analyze the predictors of residual aneurysmal filling at early angiographic follow-up.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained neuroendovascular database at 14 high-volume US centers was conducted for all patients who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysms between 2011 and 2019. Aneurysms were graded on the O'Kelly-Marotta scale (OKM).A total of 2277 patients underwent FDS embolization for intracranial aneurysms during the study period. The patient's mean age was 55 (SD ± 13.5) years, and 82% were female. The median maximal aneurysm diameter was 6.7 mm (IQR 4.10-11 mm). Complete aneurysm obliteration (OKM grade 4) occurred in 1109 patients (68%), and 146 (9%) were OKM grade 3, 188 (12%) were OKM grade 2, and 174 (11%) were OKM grade 1. In the adjusted multivariate analysis, individuals in the 65-74 years and 75+ years age groups had significantly increased risk of residual aneurysm filling at 6-month follow-up compared with the 18-44 years age group (odds ratio [OR] 1.92 (95% CI: 1.33-2.78) and 2.92 (95% CI: 1.79-4.77), respectively). Aneurysms arising from the superior cerebellar artery, the basilar artery, and the carotid terminus were more likely to have a residual filling (OR 12.6, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 4.27, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 3.16, 95% CI: 1.24-8.06, respectively).As the utilization of FDS for intracranial aneurysms becomes more widespread, the efficacy of aneurysm obliteration needs to be assessed. Our results indicate that several patient-dependent factors, such as age, aneurysm location, and size, predict the likelihood of residual aneurysm filling 6 months post-treatment.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

The researchers analyzed birth records in Minnesota to estimate how many babies were born with cCMV before and after the implementation of two different screening programs - one focused on hearing issues, and one that tested all newborns. They found that the birth prevalence of cCMV was about 3 times higher after the hearing-focused screening, and 18 times higher after universal newborn screening was introduced. This suggests that without systematic screening, most babies born with cCMV will go undiagnosed, missing opportunities for early intervention and treatment. While the study was limited to one region, it highlights the importance of widespread newborn screening to identify and support infants with cCMV, which can have serious long-term impacts on a child's health and development if left undetected."
40961344,2026-01-01,Prevalence and Magnitude Weight Loss Among Collegiate Wrestlers.,"Jagim, AR, Dobbs, WC, Horswill, CA, Twohey, E, Fields, JB, and Jones, MT. Prevalence and magnitude weight loss among collegiate wrestlers. J Strength Cond Res 40(1): 90-97, 2026-The purpose of this study was to examine the percentage of wrestlers who compete in their minimal weight class (MWC), and the magnitude of weight loss. Data from the 2023-2024 collegiate season were retrospectively analyzed resulting in a sample of 9,638 collegiate male wrestlers from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( n = 1,904) and all 3 divisions of the National Collegiate Athletics Association ( n = 7,734). All wrestlers completed skinfold assessments for weight certification at the start of the competition season. The lowest recorded weight class (LRW) achieved by each wrestler during the season was also recorded and used to determine magnitude of weight loss. Out of the 4,605 (53.2%) of wrestlers who competed in their MWC, their average amount of weight loss was significantly higher than those who did not compete in their MWC (3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.2 ± 2.9 kg.; p < 0.001), yet they had an initial lower body fat percentage (12.7 ± 2.9 vs. 17.5 ± 4.8%; p < 0.001). At the time of weight certification, wrestlers weighed 8.1 ± 4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.0-8.2; effect size (ES) = 1.8) kg more than their minimal wrestling weight. The LRW was 3.6 ± 2.9 (95% CI: 3.6-3.7; ES = 1.2) kg lower than their weight at the time of weight certification. Given that slightly more than half of the male wrestlers competed in their MWC, coaches and sports practitioners should recognize that not all athletes follow the traditional assumption of cutting to the lowest possible weight class. Importantly, those who did achieve their MWC had lower initial body fat percentages, limiting the amount of weight they could safely lose. This underscores the need for individualized weight management strategies that consider body composition and health implications.Copyright © 2025 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",Journal of strength and conditioning research,"Jan 01, 2026",2026,Jan,01,Andrew R Jagim|Ward C Dobbs|Craig A Horswill|Eric Twohey|Jennifer B Fields|Margaret T Jones,Andrew R Jagim|Eric Twohey,"Department of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Exercise and Sport Science, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Physical Therapy, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Emertius, Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut; and.|School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia.","Andrew R Jagim, Ward C Dobbs, Craig A Horswill, Eric Twohey, Jennifer B Fields, Margaret T Jones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961344/,"This study examined the weight loss practices of collegiate wrestlers, an important issue as extreme weight loss can negatively impact health and performance. The researchers analyzed data from over 9,600 male wrestlers across different college athletic associations. They found that over half of the wrestlers competed in their minimum weight class, losing an average of 3.9 kg (8.6 lbs). Those who made their minimum weight had lower body fat percentages initially, suggesting they had less weight to safely lose. Overall, wrestlers weighed 8.1 kg (17.9 lbs) more at the start of the season than their minimum competition weight, and lost 3.6 kg (7.9 lbs) on average to reach their lowest weight. These findings challenge the assumption that all wrestlers cut to the absolute lowest weight class possible. Instead, coaches and trainers should develop individualized weight management strategies that consider each athlete's body composition and health to promote safe, sustainable weight loss practices. While this large-scale study provides valuable insights, more research is needed on the long-term impacts of weight cycling in this sport."

Systematic reviews aim to comprehensively analyze all available research on a given topic, but the authors argue that a one-size-fits-all approach to synthesizing this evidence is often inadequate. 

The researchers reviewed various evidence synthesis techniques, such as meta-analysis and narrative review, and explored how the choice of method should depend on factors like the type of research question, the quality and heterogeneity of the available studies, and the intended use of the review. For example, they suggest that meta-analysis may be most appropriate for questions about the effectiveness of a treatment, while narrative synthesis could be better suited for exploring complex interventions or understanding patient experiences. 

The key finding is that systematic reviewers must carefully select the most appropriate synthesis method to ensure the review accurately addresses the research question and provides useful, actionable insights. This is important because systematic reviews often guide clinical practice and healthcare policy decisions, so the validity of the conclusions drawn is critical. While this may require more time and effort upfront, it can lead to more reliable, impactful results that better serve patients and the"
40915405,2026-01-01,Principles of Coronary Sinus Narrowing to Relieve Myocardial Ischemia and Improve Angina.,"Effective therapy for patients suffering from refractory angina remains a major unmet need. Chronic angina, which is refractory to medical and interventional therapies, affects patients who are not suitable for revascularization, patients following successful revascularization, and patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. Coronary sinus (CS) narrowing has been studied as a potential therapy for patients with angina. Pre-clinical and clinical data, including 2 randomized sham-controlled clinical trials and 2 large prospective multi-center registries, have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of CS narrowing in patients with refractory angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Preliminary pathophysiologic studies suggest that CS narrowing may also improve coronary microvascular function and alleviate microvascular angina. Here, we review the historical perspective, mechanism of action, and clinical applications of CS narrowing. In Conclusion: With the accumulation of new data, the time is ripe to revisit the therapeutic benefits seen in historical CS interventions and demonstrated in recent clinical research to reduce angina and ischemia and improve quality of life of patients with disabling refractory angina.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

This research explores a potential new therapy called coronary sinus (CS) narrowing to help these patients. The coronary sinus is a vein that drains blood from the heart muscle. By narrowing this vein, the researchers aimed to improve blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart, thereby reducing angina and ischemia (inadequate blood flow). 

The study reviewed previous animal and human research on CS narrowing, including two rigorous clinical trials that compared the procedure to a sham (placebo) treatment. These studies found that CS narrowing was safe and effectively reduced angina symptoms and improved quality of life in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease who could not undergo traditional bypass or stent procedures. The researchers also suggest that CS narrowing may help patients with microvascular angina, where the small blood vessels in the heart are dysfunctional. 

Overall, this research indicates that CS narrowing is a promising new option to alleviate debilitating chest pain in patients with limited treatment choices. While more research is needed, these findings"
40998187,2026-01-01,Exploring the cardiopulmonary effects of tirzepatide in atrial fibrillation and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The coexistence of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often leads to worse clinical outcomes. Tirzepatide is a promising therapy for diabetes and weight management, with potential cardiovascular benefits via anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impact in patients with both atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown.Using the TriNetX Analytics Research Network, patients aged ≥18 years with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between 6/1/2022 and 1/1/2024 were included. Patients were divided into tirzepatide and control groups. Propensity score matching included demographics, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiac events, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation over one year.A total of 3,728 tirzepatide users and 499,199 controls were identified; 3,726 patients remained in each group after matching. Tirzepatide use was associated with lower odds of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR: 0.145; 95% CI: 0.115-0.184), hospitalization (OR: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.258-0.313), stroke (OR: 0.619; 95% CI: 0.519-0.738), cardiac arrest (OR: 0.491; 95% CI: 0.362-0.667), heart failure exacerbation (OR: 0.270; 95% CI: 0.236-0.308), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (OR: 0.586; 95% CI: 0.513-0.671). Lower odds of anti-arrhythmic drug initiation, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation were also observed.Tirzepatide use was associated with improved mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced need for rhythm control interventions. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with these two conditions often have worse health outcomes, so finding effective treatments is important. 

The researchers analyzed medical records from a large database to compare patients taking tirzepatide to those who were not. They looked at factors like risk of death, heart-related events, and COPD flare-ups over one year. After accounting for differences between the two groups, they found that tirzepatide users had significantly lower risks across the board - 85% lower risk of death, 72% lower risk of hospitalization, and around 40% lower risks of stroke, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and COPD exacerbations. Tirzepatide users also needed fewer interventions to control their atrial fibrillation.

These promising results suggest tirzepatide could provide important cardiovascular and respiratory benefits for patients with both atrial fibrillation and COPD. However, more research is still neede"

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies up to December 2024 that compared BESG and SESG for IBD during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms. A total of 1,107 articles were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. End points included a composite of all endoleaks, types 1b, 1c, and 3 endoleaks, buttock claudication, IIA occlusion, and IBD-related reinterventions during follow-up.Four cohort studies met the eligibility criteria with 684 patients treated with 711 IBDs. 460 (64.7%) BESGs and 251 (35.3%) SESGs were used in the target IIAs. Both groups had similar demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. The median age of patients was 71.1 years and 88.7% were male. A composite of all endoleaks (odds ratio [OR]: 5.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 26.63; P = 0.03; I2 = 0) was significantly less common in patients treated with SESG compared to BESG. Type 1b (OR: 4.62; 95% CI: 0.18-116.16; P = 0.35), type 1c (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.09-25.03; P = 0.77), type 3 endoleaks (OR: 5.25; 95% CI: 0.58-47.47; P = 0.14), buttock claudication (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.06-2.58; P = 0.32; I2 = 0%), IIA occlusion (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.06-2.57; P = 0.34; I2 = 0%), and IBD-related reinterventions (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.84-3.11; P = 0.15; I2 = 0%) were not significantly different between groups.SESG for IIA was associated with a lower incidence of all types of endoleaks when compared to BESG during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms using IBD. However, types 1b, 1c, and 3 endoleaks; buttock claudication; IIA occlusion; and IBD-related reinterventions were similar among SESG and BESG.

They found that the self-expandable stents were associated with a lower risk of all types of leaks around the stent, which can be a serious complication. However, the two stent types had similar rates of other complications like reduced blood flow to the pelvis and the need for additional procedures. This suggests that self-expandable stents may be the safer option for this type of aortic repair, but the balloon-expandable stents may be more versatile for treating complex anatomical conditions. This information can help doctors and patients make more informed decisions about the best treatment approach for aortic aneurysms, potentially improving outcomes and reducing complications for these high-risk patients."
40912385,2026-01-01,Extracoronary Arterial Pathologies in Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of acute coronary syndrome and has been associated with extracoronary arteriopathies, such as fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), aneurysms, and dissections across other vascular beds. However, these associations remain understudied in the literature. This study aims to characterize the prevalence and distribution of extracoronary arteriopathies in a large cohort of SCAD patients. Patients diagnosed with SCAD were extracted from 2018 to 2024. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were collected. Available vascular imaging, including echocardiograms, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance, were used to assess for extracoronary arteriopathies. The prevalence and location of FMD, aneurysms, and dissections in extracoronary vascular beds were documented. Among 1,380 SCAD patients, 564 (40.9%) were found to have FMD, 166 (12.0%) had extra-coronary arterial dissections, and 228 (16.5%) had aneurysms in at least 1 extracoronary vascular bed. The most common sites of FMD were renal, carotid, vertebral, and iliac/femoral arteries. Aneurysms were most frequently located in cerebral, carotid, renal, and splenic arteries. Dissections were most prevalent in the carotid, vertebral, extremity, and celiac arteries. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were rare, with only 4 patients showing thoracic aortic dissection. Extracoronary arteriopathies are prevalent in patients with SCAD, affecting more than 47% of the cohort described here. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive vascular imaging in patients with SCAD to detect extracoronary vascular abnormalities, which may have implications for surveillance and management strategies.Published by Elsevier Inc.",The American journal of cardiology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026,Jan,01,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Hoang N Pham|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,"Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.

SCAD occurs when a tear develops in one of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen. The researchers wanted to better understand whether SCAD patients also have abnormalities in other blood vessels throughout the body, as this could impact their treatment and long-term health. 

The researchers reviewed medical records and imaging tests for over 1,300 SCAD patients. They found that nearly half of these patients had additional vascular problems, such as a condition called fibromuscular dysplasia that can weaken and narrow blood vessels, as well as aneurysms (bulges) and tears in arteries outside the heart. The most common locations for these issues were in the kidneys, neck, and abdominal arteries. Importantly, only a small number of patients had problems with the main artery in the chest, the thoracic aorta.

These findings suggest that SCAD is often accompanied by more widespread vascular disease, which could increase the risk of complications. The"

We examined the association between genetically determined adiposity and four common NHL subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone lymphoma, using eight genome-wide association studies of European ancestry (N = 10,629 cases, 9505 controls) and constructing polygenic scores for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Higher genetically determined BMI was associated with an increased risk of DLBCL [odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05-1.33, p = .005]. This finding was consistent with Mendelian randomization analyses, which demonstrated a similar increased risk of DLBCL with higher genetically determined BMI (ORper SD = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = .03). No significant associations were observed with other NHL subtypes. Our study demonstrates a positive link between a genetically determined BMI and an increased risk of DLBCL, providing additional support for increased adiposity as a risk factor for DLBCL.© 2025 International Agency for Research on Cancer; licensed by UICC and The Author(s).

The study used genetic data to examine whether people with a higher genetically-determined body mass index (BMI) - a measure of body fat - have a greater risk of developing DLBCL. The researchers analyzed genetic information from over 10,000 DLBCL patients and 9,500 healthy individuals of European ancestry. They found that people with a higher genetically-determined BMI had an increased risk of DLBCL, but not other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that excess body weight may be a contributing factor for DLBCL specifically. The researchers used two different statistical methods to arrive at this conclusion, strengthening the evidence. While more research is needed, these findings provide important insights into the potential role of obesity in the development of this blood cancer.

40907858,2026-01-01,Association of Maternal Cardiac Disease and Echocardiographic Parameters With Neonatal Outcomes.,"Women with cardiac disease have worse neonatal outcomes compared to women without cardiac disease; risk factors are not well-defined. We hypothesized that structural heart disease, as assessed by echocardiography, is a noninvasive metric for abnormal hemodynamics and an unfavorable maternal-fetal environment. We assessed the association between echocardiographic markers of structural heart disease in women with cardiac disease and a primary endpoint of adverse neonatal outcomes operationalized as neonates with small-for-gestational-age birth weight, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit/transition care unit admission, or neonatal/fatal demise. Women with cardiac disease who delivered at a tertiary care center between 2014 and 2022 were included. Echocardiographic parameters and neonatal outcomes were collected. A subgroup analysis was performed among women with congenital heart disease (CHD). Among 1,108 women, maternal diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.8-18.6), hypertensive disease (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.4-6.2), CHD (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8), and cardiomyopathy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.8) were associated with the primary endpoint. Peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity was associated with the primary endpoint (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1). Biventricular function and severity of valvular disease were not associated with the primary endpoint in the total study population and in the CHD subgroup. In conclusion, maternal cardiac diagnosis is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Structural heart disease as assessed by echocardiography was not predictive of adverse neonatal outcomes.

The study looked at women with various types of heart conditions, including high blood pressure, congenital heart defects, and weakened heart muscle. The researchers used echocardiograms, a type of ultrasound that can assess the structure and function of the heart, to see if specific measures of heart health were linked to poorer outcomes for the babies. 

The key findings were that certain maternal heart conditions, like pulmonary hypertension and preeclampsia, were associated with a higher risk of complications in the newborn, such as being born prematurely or with a low birth weight. However, the echocardiogram measurements did not reliably predict these adverse outcomes. This suggests that the underlying heart disease itself, rather than just the structural changes visible on the ultrasound, may be driving the increased risks for the baby.

40891958,2026-01-01,Post-liver transplantation outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure: Impact of alcohol as a precipitant and etiology of chronic liver disease.,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been associated with excellent post-liver transplant (LT) outcomes at 1 year; however, the impact of alcohol as ACLF precipitant, specifically alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), and as etiology of chronic liver disease remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the effect of alcohol as ACLF precipitant and chronic liver disease etiology (alcohol-associated liver disease vs. non-alcohol-associated liver disease) on posttransplant outcomes. We performed a retrospective study using the Multi-Organ Dysfunction and Evaluation for LT Consortium database and included 640 patients with ACLF who underwent LT across 15 transplant centers in North America. The primary outcome was 1-year posttransplant survival. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards to compare posttransplant survival, mortality risk, and health care utilization, adjusting for age, ACLF grade, comorbid diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and HCC. The median follow-up from LT was 2.8 years (P25-P75, 2.2-5.5 y) for patients with AH-ACLF (n=42) and 3.1 years (P25-P75, 1.6-4.9 y) for patients without AH (n=598). No significant difference was observed in 1-year survival after LT in patients with AH-ACLF versus those without AH ( p =0.36). Patients with AH had significantly higher health care utilization evidenced by greater length of stay (28.5 vs. 19.0 d, p =0.004; adjusted linear estimate 16.89, 95% CI: 7.66-26.11, p <0.001), higher rates of rehabilitation placement (71.4% vs. 41.8%, p =0.002; adjusted odds ratio: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.04-8.89, p <0.001), and non-ambulatory status (39.0% vs. 21.0%, p =0.005; adjusted odds ratio: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.90-10.79, p <0.001). Compared with other etiologies, alcohol-associated liver disease was not associated with differences in 1-year mortality, mortality risk over time, or health care utilization, after excluding patients with AH as ACLF precipitant. While there were no differences in 1-year survival, AH-ACLF was associated with higher health care resource utilization compared with other ACLF precipitants.

The tricuspid valve is one of the four valves in the heart, and it can sometimes become damaged or dysfunctional. Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement is a minimally invasive surgery to replace this valve without open-heart surgery.

40993340,2026-01-01,Increased expression of ATase1/NAT8B or ATase2/NAT8 in the mouse results in an autistic-like phenotype with altered dendritic branching and spine formation.,"Neurons heavily depend on the ability of the secretory pathway to deliver correctly folded polypeptides to the periphery of the cell for the assembly, maintenance, and normal functioning of synapses. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acetylation machinery has emerged as a novel branch of the more general ER quality control machinery. It regulates the positive selection of correctly folded nascent glycoproteins, thus ensuring the efficiency of the conventional secretory pathway. ER acetylation requires the activity of two ER-luminal acetylCoA:lysine acetyltransferases, ATase1/NAT8B and ATase2/NAT8. Both acetyltransferases depend on the influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER from the cytosol, which is ensured by the coordinated action of the citrate transporters, SLC25A1 and SLC13A5, and the ER acetyl-CoA transporter, AT-1. Gene duplication events affecting ATase1 and ATase2 are associated with rare disease phenotypes that include autism and intellectual disability with dysmorphism. Here, we generated mice with neuron-specific overexpression of human ATase1 or ATase2. The animals display autistic-like behaviors with altered synaptic plasticity, altered neuronal morphology, and altered synaptic structure and function. Mechanistic assessment demonstrates that widespread proteomic changes and altered dynamics of the secretory pathway underly the synaptic defects. The phenotype of ATase1 and ATase2 overexpressing mice is reminiscent of SLC25A1, SLC13A5 and AT-1 overexpressing models. Therefore, when taken together, our results support the argument that the intracellular citrate/acetyl-CoA pathway, with the ATases acting as the last output, is immediately connected to the pathogenesis of certain rare forms of autism spectrum disorder.© 2025.

These disparities highlight significant barriers to high-quality, equitable cancer care, which can impact patient outcomes. The findings suggest that policy changes and targeted interventions are needed to address both patient-level and facility-level factors that contribute to these treatment gaps, in order to ensure all breast cancer patients receive the best possible care."
41056011,2026-01-01,SLC26A1 directs sulfate homeostasis in health and disease.,"Sulfate is essential for the sulfation of proteoglycans to maintain cell function. The mechanisms regulating the 'ins and outs' of systemic sulfate balance remain incompletely understood. SLC26A1 is an anion exchanger expressed in the kidney. It has recently been identified as a key regulator of plasma sulfate homeostasis in humans. This review summarizes current insights into SLC26A1 function and its role in human diseases.Slc26a1-knockout mouse models exhibit reduced plasma sulfate and abnormal sulfate and oxalate homeostasis, accompanied by augmented susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced liver injury and kidney stone disease, although findings on oxalate homeostasis are inconsistent. In humans, rare and common SLC26A1 variants are associated with hyposulfatemia, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and, in some cases, nephrolithiasis. Functional assays confirm disrupted sulfate and oxalate transport of damaging variants. However, the knockout mouse models have been incompletely characterized, and few patients with damaging SLC26A1 variants have been characterized regarding sulfate and oxalate homeostasis and associated diseases.SLC26A1 emerges as a key regulator of sulfate homeostasis, with potential roles in hepatic detoxification, skeletal integrity, and kidney stone disease. Additional mouse models with tissue-specific gene deletion are needed to delineate the role of SLC26A1 in sulfate and oxalate homeostasis as well as disease pathogenesis. Identification of additional patients with damaging variants in SLC26A1 as well as larger population studies may help to elucidate causal relationships of SLC26A1 activity with clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Sulfate imbalances have been linked to various medical conditions, but the mechanisms behind sulfate homeostasis were not fully understood. 

The researchers used mouse models and human genetic data to investigate the function of SLC26A1 and its impact on health. They found that mice lacking this gene had reduced levels of sulfate in their blood and experienced problems with sulfate and oxalate (a compound related to kidney stones) metabolism. These mice were also more susceptible to liver damage and kidney stone formation. In humans, rare and common variants in the SLC26A1 gene were associated with low sulfate levels, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and in some cases, kidney stones.

These findings suggest that SLC26A1 is a key regulator of sulfate balance in the body, with potential implications for liver function, bone health, and kidney stone risk. Further research is needed to fully understand how SLC26A1 activity influences these various aspects of health and disease."

The TRIUMPH clinical development program evaluates its safety and efficacy concurrently for the treatment of obesity and two related complications-obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and knee osteoarthritis (OA). A novel basket trial design simultaneously evaluates retatrutide treatment across these multiple adiposity-related disease states.TRIUMPH consists of four Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies assessing weekly subcutaneous retatrutide compared to placebo, in conjunction with healthy diet and physical activity in over 5800 participants. The four trials consist of two weight management basket trials (TRIUMPH-1 and TRIUMPH-2) with OSA and/or OA protocols nested within the weight management trial; one weight management trial in a population with CVD (TRIUMPH-3); and one stand-alone OA trial (TRIUMPH-4). The primary endpoint for weight management is percent change in body weight, for OSA is change in Apnea-Hypopnea Index and for knee OA includes change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale score. The basket trial permits independent analysis of weight management, OSA and OA studies with type I error rate controlled at α = 0.05, split between the overarching weight management and each basket trial.By recruiting participants with shared disease exposures, the TRIUMPH program will assess the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for the treatment of adults with obesity and two of its common complications-OSA and OA.© 2025 Eli Lilly and Company and The Author(s).

Simultaneously, reforms to the application process, including the introduction of preference signaling, have also added a level of complexity. In orthopaedic surgery, these changes have influenced applicant behavior and program director (PD) priorities. This study examined the effect of the USMLE Step 1 scoring transition on orthopaedic surgery residency applicant characteristics and PD selection criteria, with particular attention to trends in USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores, research productivity, and evolving PD preferences.We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing aggregate data of orthopaedic surgery applicants in the National Resident Matching Program from 2014 to 2024 and the 2024 National Resident Matching Program Program Director Survey.From 2014 to 2024, the average Step 2 CK score of matched orthopaedic surgery applicants increased markedly, from 251 to 257 ( P < 0.05). Research productivity also surged, with the mean number of abstracts, presentations, and publications increasing from 6.7 to 23.8 ( P < 0.05) and mean number of research experiences increasing from 3.7 to 8.1 ( P < 0.05) in the same period. Participating PDs prioritized Step 2 CK scores (94%), and a lesser percentage endorsed research involvement (64%) as important for interview.The Step 1 scoring has prompted shifts in applicant behavior, including increased research involvement and a maintained focus on Step 2 CK scores. The surge in research productivity suggests an increased focus on academic achievements in the absence of Step 1 scores.

41085620,2026-01-01,"Identification of Antibody-Cognate Antigens via a High-Throughput, Affinity Chromatography-Based, Shotgun Immunoproteomics Pipeline.","Since they were first described in the late nineteenth century, antibodies have become widely recognized as being able to serve mechanistic functions in both ""protective,"" as well as ""pathogenic"" adaptive immune responses. Due to their critical roles in a wide range of disease states, there has been significant interest in the fields of immunology and medicine in identifying individual antibody-cognate antigens. However, numerous technical and logistical challenges associated with older cognate antigen identification strategies limited their widespread utilization in these fields. To meet this critical need, we recently developed an optimized, high-throughput, affinity chromatography-based, shotgun immunoproteomics pipeline which we have previously demonstrated resolves many of the identified weaknesses of past methodologies. This chapter provides a comprehensive protocol for each step of this shotgun immunoproteomics pipeline, from input protein sample preparation through data analysis and antigen identification.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of various outreach interventions in improving substance use outcomes among homeless populations.A systematic search of studies (published January 1990-January 2024) in the PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted. A network meta-analysis was executed to compare outcomes of substance use frequency (self-reported days of substance use across a specified time) and severity (as determined by validated assessments) at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Treatment effects were standardized by using mean differences, and interventions were ranked by using P scores.Of the 716 studies screened, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. The community reinforcement approach (CRA) demonstrated the highest effectiveness across the follow-up points (P scores=0.81-0.83), showing the strongest effect in reducing substance use (standardized mean difference=-0.28, 95% CI=-0.66, 0.10) among homeless populations. Combining assertive community treatment with intensive case management showed marked improvement at the 2-year follow-up (P score=0.79), whereas critical time intervention maintained strong performance across the follow-ups. Substantial heterogeneity was observed across the analyses (I²=76.3%-84.7%).Comprehensive and integrated approaches, such as CRA and combined interventions, may most effectively address substance use disorders among homeless populations.

This study assessed the association between preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and mortality, and longitudinal changes in CPET.A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive adult patients with Ebstein anomaly who had tricuspid surgery between 2007 and 2018 with preoperative CPET. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included changes in CPET.The cohort included 116 patient, of whom 94 (81.1%) were New York Heart Association Functional Class I/II. Median age was 39.6 years, and 75 (64.7%) were women. There were 44 (37.9%) with ≥1 prior sternotomies, 58 (50%) underwent Cone repair, and 55 (47.5%) had tricuspid replacement. Median percentage predicted peak oxygen consumption (Vo2) was 62%, and ventilatory efficiency was 30 L/min/min. Fifteen (12.9%) had severe right ventricle dysfunction, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 58%. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, there were 8 deaths. Ventilatory efficiency trended to be associated with mortality (P = .075) on univariate analysis and was the largest contributor to prediction of mortality in machine learning random forest models. Thirty-three patients had CPET at a median of 2.9 years after surgery. There was significant improvement in ventilatory efficiency (30 L/min/L/min preoperatively vs 27 L/min/L/min postoperatively, P = .015).In those with minimal or no symptoms, ventilatory efficiency is one of the most important variables in predicting mortality after surgery. Patients may have improved ventilatory efficiency after tricuspid surgery for Ebstein anomaly.

41067597,2026-01-01,Relationship of growth in the first five years of life and risk of long bone fracture.,"Birth size and early childhood growth can affect peak bone mass and later risk of osteoporosis and fracture. We examined the relationship between growth trajectory in the first 5 years of life and the risk of fracture in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.We conducted a population-based, case-control study of infants born to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA between 1976 and 1982. Of 10,938 in the birth cohort, 7892 had at least 1 visit after age 10 y. Cases (n = 1515) with long bone fractures, excluding the femur, after age 6 y were identified. We abstracted childhood weights and heights before age 5.5 y from a stratified random sample of 728 fracture cases in childhood (6-12.9 y), adolescence (13-17.9 y), or adulthood (≥18 y; n = 275 in each group). Weights and heights were categorized into eight age groups between birth and 5.5 y. Control subjects, who had not had a prior long bone fracture were matched with cases for age (within 6 m) and sex.599 matched sets of cases and controls had weight measurements at birth and in at least 2 age groups and 397 matched sets of cases and controls had height measurements in at least 3 age groups. Two optimal weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height trajectory solutions were identified: one sustained above the median (Cluster 1) and one sustained below the median (Cluster 2). Compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age birth size, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) was associated with a reduced risk of fracture (OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.23-0.82). Cluster 1 weight-for-age (OR 1.19; 0.95-1.49), height-for-age (OR 1.20; 0.90-1.60), and weight-for-height (OR 1.06; 0.80-1.41) trajectories were not associated with subsequent fracture vs Cluster 2. The stratified analysis by fracture age group had similar results, but the relationship with SGA was only significant in the childhood group (6-12.9 y).Growth trajectories in the first 5 y of life were not associated with subsequent fracture. SGA infants had a lower fracture risk between 6 and 13 y of age.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

41066877,2026-01-01,CD44-targeted NLCs improvetrans-resveratrolin vitrocellular uptake and cytotoxicity in high-grade glioma cells.,"High-grade gliomas are aggressive brain tumors associated with poor prognosis and a short median survival. Despite a multi-modal therapy, including surgical resection, and adjuvant radio and chemotherapy, few advances were achieved in the clinics. The urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to treat brain tumor has driven the development of innovative drug delivery technologies such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). NLCs have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy, particularly due to improvements in the delivery of poorly soluble drugs, with promising anti-tumor potential, such as the polyphenol trans-resveratrol (RSV). This study aimed to develop and evaluate the in vitro biological properties of NLCs loaded with RSV and functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery to CD-44-expressing glioma cells. NLCs were produced using the fusion-emulsification technique followed by sonication, and NLC-RSVs were functionalized with HA through physicochemical adsorption. NLCs were characterized in terms of hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential, and further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and the in vitro drug release profile were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity was assessed in C6 glioma cells using the resazurin reduction assay. The NLC-RSV formulations exhibited an average size of 160.5 nm, a PDI of 0.36, and a zeta potential of + 21.85 mV. Functionalization was performed using HA at 0.5 mg/mL in a 2:1 (v/v) HA:NLC ratio. The EE% of the HA-NLC-RSV formulation was 88.98 ± 0.55 %. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of HA and indicated successful interaction of HA with the lipid matrix. DSC data suggested that RSV was effectively encapsulated and protected within the lipid matrix. The in vitro release study revealed that HA functionalization provided a slower and more controlled drug release. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that HA functionalization enhanced the antiproliferative effect, with the RSV-HA-NLC formulation displaying the most potent effect. This finding was supported by increased cellular uptake of HA-NLCs in C6 cells. These results indicate that HA-functionalized NLCs represent a promising strategy to improve the solubility and targeted delivery of poorly soluble drugs such as RSV.

This study explored a new approach to delivering a promising anti-cancer compound called resveratrol more effectively to glioma cells. The researchers developed nanoparticles (called nanostructured lipid carriers or NLCs) that were loaded with resveratrol and coated with a molecule called hyaluronic acid, which helps the nanoparticles target glioma cells that express a specific protein called CD44. The NLCs were thoroughly characterized, and the researchers found that the hyaluronic acid coating improved the nanoparticles' ability to be taken up by glioma cells and kill them more effectively compared to uncoated NLCs or free resveratrol. This suggests that this targeted nanoparticle approach could enhance the delivery and anti-tumor effects of resveratrol against glioma cells. While more research is needed, especially in animal models, these findings represent an important step forward in developing better treatments for this devastating type of brain cancer by leveraging innovative drug delivery technologies."

However, traditional systems frequently face issues of under-reporting, particularly concerning near-miss and no-harm events, thereby limiting opportunities for organizational learning and harm prevention. This initiative used quality improvement principles to design a new reporting system at our institution to enhance safety culture.Following extensive stakeholder feedback and multidisciplinary collaboration, a new system was implemented on July 22, 2022. Key features included streamlined reporting, centralized data analysis, and enhanced transparency.Overall event reporting as well as proportional reporting of near-miss and no-harm events increased significantly from around 60% preimplementation to 80% after implementation. Staff engagement also improved, as shown by a steady rise in the number of unique event reporters and reviewers.The new reporting system has improved reporting overall, with increases in near-miss and no-harm events, along with increased staff engagement with the reporting and review process. Our experience offers practical lessons for institutions seeking to strengthen the learning value of event reporting systems. The principles we identified with simplifying ease of use, integrating into the EHR, improving data transparency, and encouraging greater involvement with event review, along with clear oversight protocols, apply beyond our institution and are not limited to a specific PSRS product or system. These initial outcomes support a culture of safety and bolster organizational learning, with future study needed on long-term effects on patient safety outcomes, staff involvement, and increased trust.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, these systems often struggle to capture ""near-miss"" events where harm was narrowly avoided, as well as ""no-harm"" events where patients were not injured. This research describes how one hospital redesigned its reporting system to make it easier for staff to log these types of incidents. After the new system was implemented, the researchers found a significant increase in the overall number of safety events reported, with a greater proportion being near-misses and no-harm events. This suggests the new system was successful in encouraging more comprehensive reporting, which is crucial for allowing the hospital to identify potential risks and take steps to prevent future harm to patients. While more research is needed on the long-term impacts, this study provides a promising model for how healthcare organizations can optimize their safety reporting to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement, ultimately benefiting patients and the quality of care."
41051081,2026-01-01,Time Is of the Essence: Impact of Transfer on Outcomes in Acute Mesenteric Ischemia.,"Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a vascular emergency where delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to irreversible bowel injury and death. Many patients initially present to hospitals without surgical or vascular capabilities and require interhospital transfer. The clinical impact of such transfers on treatment and outcomes in AMI remains poorly defined.We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2019 to 2021) to evaluate the association between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients with AMI. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients were categorized by transfer status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with in-hospital mortality and procedural interventions, adjusting for age and comorbidity burden.Of 39,690 hospitalizations for AMI, 14.6% involved interhospital transfer. Transferred patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more often treated at rural or micropolitan hospitals. They were significantly more likely to undergo major surgical and vascular procedures, including bowel resection (odds ratio [OR] 3.48), mesenteric bypass (OR 3.32), and angioplasty (OR 2.66; all p < 0.0001). Markers of critical illness, such as intubation (OR 2.15) and dialysis (OR 1.30), were also more frequent in this group. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among transferred patients (OR 2.05), and transfer remained independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity burden (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.10).Interhospital transfer in AMI is strongly associated with increased clinical severity and in-hospital mortality. These findings emphasize the urgency of early diagnosis, rapid triage, and timely access to definitive care, supporting the need for structured regional systems and transfer protocols for AMI.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

41006073,2026-01-01,VPS13C heterozygous loss of function as a modifier for suboptimal response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease.,"To report a clinical series of four patients diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) who exhibit heterozygous pathogenic variants in the VPS13C gene.VPS13C encodes vacuolar protein sorting 13C, a lipid transport protein that localizes between the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes-lysosomes, functioning as a bridge to allow phospholipids to traverse the cytosol. Mutations in this gene have been associated with early-onset PARK23 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), highlighting its importance in mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis.Cases were identified through the Mayo Clinic Data Explorer. We included all subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PD who tested positive for a heterozygous VPS13C variant defined as pathogenic by the ACMG guidelines.DaT-SCAN imaging was consistent with PD diagnosis in three patients. Non-motor symptoms and cognitive impairment were prominent phenotypical characteristics in all cases: all the patients presented with insomnia, anxiety, depression, severe fatigue, and short-memory loss. The response to oral levodopa treatment was suboptimal, with an initial benefit followed by rapid decreased responsiveness. Additionally, two patients developed wearing-off episodes and one of them also exhibited treatment-induced dyskinesias.We hypothesize that VPS13C may confer an increased risk of EOPD in carriers of pathogenic variants, and may function as a phenotype modifier gene, contributing to significant non-motor symptoms development and suboptimal levodopa response. Specifically, we propose that the suboptimal treatment response is associated with a decrease level of dopamine L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1).Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Recognizing the need for guidance, international multi-professional experts convened at the first Reirradiation Collaborative Group (ReCOG) Meeting. This report presents results from a survey on best practices, challenges, and knowledge gaps among experts on thoracic reirradiation.A comprehensive 50-question survey was developed by experts and discussed within the thoracic focus group at ReCOG. It included questions on participant demographics and clinical experience, patient-related clinical conditions and selection, imaging and targets, treatment planning, and dose accumulation. Participants were asked for perceived challenges as well as gaps in knowledge.The survey was completed by 34/51 invited experts (67 % response rate). Most respondents (79 %) were experienced physicists and radiation oncologists (>10 years) primarily at university hospitals (65 %). The most common tumors treated were locally recurrent lung cancer, mediastinal nodes, or thoracic metastases. Reirradiation goals included prolonging local control and survival, and alleviating/preventing symptoms. Conditions precluding reirradiation were persistent grade 3+ toxicity and progressive disease. Major toxicity concerns were bleeding, airway injury/fistula, and esophageal ulceration/fistula. Technical practices varied with regards to image registration, dose accumulation and recovery factors. Advanced treatment planning techniques and IGRT were consistent amongst respondents. Major challenges included lack of clinical guidelines and lack of software support tools.Thoracic reirradiation is an increasingly prevalent area of interest despite scarcity of prospective data. The major focus currently still is primarily on treatment-related factors and the question of how to combine reirradiation with systemic therapy. However, there is little guidance on whether and how to modify a planned reirradiation dose based on patient comorbidities or recovery from the prior radiation course. This survey identified emerging areas of consensus as well as relevant variations and gaps in practice.© 2025 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate its significance on surgical and long-term outcomes in a well-defined cohort of patients undergoing cytoreductive hepatectomy for small bowel NET liver metastasis (sbNETLM).Patients undergoing cytoreductive hepatectomy between January 2000 and December 2020 were included (CS, n = 154; non-functional, n = 133); post-progression analysis extended through December 2023 in 191 patients.Query RESULTS: Age (60 vs. 63 years; p = 0.059) and sex distribution (47% vs. 54% male; p = 0.278) were similar in patients with CS compared with non-functional sbNETLM. CS was associated with more (p < 0.001) and larger (p < 0.001) hepatic metastases, requiring more frequent major hepatectomies (p < 0.001). Postoperative morbidity (22% vs. 21%; p = 0.925) and 90 day mortality (1% vs. 2%; p = 0.666) were similar in major resections. In CS patients, median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were shorter (mOS: 10.1 vs. 12.5 years, p = 0.035; mPFS: 1.6 vs. 2.4 years, p = 0.015). In subgroups with extensive tumor burden, CS was linked to shorter mOS (9.2 vs. 15.3 years, p = 0.028). Post-progression, 50% of CS patients and 41% of initially non-functional sbNETLM developed secondary CS, increasing the risk of carcinoid heart disease and mortality from cardiac and renal failure. CS was the strongest liver metastasis-specific predictor of mortality in multivariable regression analysis (HR 1.73, p = 0.004).While surgical risk is not elevated, long-term survival is reduced in CS. Secondary CS can develop after tumor progression, even in initially non-functional sbNETLM, further worsening prognosis. Regular screening and proactive management of CS may improve long-term outcomes.© 2025.

41039797,2026-01-01,Dual TRBC1-CD3 Immunohistochemistry Shows High Diagnostic Utility in Differentiating Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome From Reactive Inflammatory Dermatoses in Skin Biopsies.,"Evaluation of T-cell receptor (TCR) β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) expression is an alternative T-cell clonality assessment method. However, evaluation of TRBC1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for distinguishing mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sezary syndrome (SS) from reactive inflammatory infiltrates in skin is incomplete. We evaluated the utility of a novel dual TRBC1-CD3 IHC stain in skin biopsies with MF/SS (n=40), reactive (n=24), or atypical T-cell infiltrates indeterminant for MF/SS (n=9). Twenty of 24 reactive cases showed clear polytypic TRBC1 expression (median percent TRBC1 positivity among CD3-positive T cells [%TRBC1+] 50% in dermis, 42.5% in epidermis among all cases), while 34/40 MF/SS were clearly monotypic (%TRBC1+ either ≤20% or ≥85%) (sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 91.7%, positive predictive value 94.4%, negative predictive value 78.6%). Discordance between TRBC1 expression and diagnosis was associated with few neoplastic/monotypic T cells and/or lack of physical separation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic populations. Among patch/plaque MF/SS, TRBC1 showed similar diagnostic sensitivity (80.0% vs. 86.7%) and high categorical correlation (monotypic vs. not monotypic, 80%) with TCR gene rearrangement results. TRBC1 interpretation was reproducible, with ≥2/3 and 3/3 pathologists rendering identical interpretations in 100% and 86% of cases, respectively, after independent review and 100% agreement following collective review. Digital image analysis confirmed visual %TRBC1+ accuracy ( r =0.9749, P <0.0001). On the basis of these results, we propose %TRBC1+ cutoffs of <25% or >75% for establishing T-cell monotypia in skin. Considering such thresholds, TRBC1-CD3 evaluation facilitated diagnostic refinement in 7/9 (78%) atypical cases. Overall, TRBC1-CD3 IHC clearly and rapidly aids diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell proliferations.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since then, several smaller case series have been published; however, our understanding of them continues to be quite limited given their rarity. We herein studied 18 additional cases, the largest series to date. Eighteen tumors present in 9 male, 8 female, and 1 nonbinary patient with a median age of 35 years (range: 11 to 70 y) and involved the neck (5), the chest region (4), thigh (3), back (1), shoulder (1), forehead (1), lower leg (1), axilla (1), and the parapharyngeal region (1). Clinical follow-up (9/18 tumors; 50%; median: 10 mo; range: 4 to 40 mo) showed consistent indolent behavior without local recurrences or distant metastases. On morphology, these tumors were characterized by well-circumscription and distinctive peripheral crescent-shaped vessels. They were composed of uniform spindle and round cells growing in short fascicles within often densely hyalinized collagen lacking significant mitotic activity, necrosis, or cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemically, about half of the tested tumors expressed focal to rarely diffuse S100 with occasional co-expression of SOX10. Interestingly, almost half of the tested cases also showed complete loss of RB expression. All but 1 tumor harbored a PRRX1::NCOA1 fusion, while 1 case harbored a novel PRRX1::EP300 fusion.

They found that patients receiving the combination therapy had a significantly higher risk of developing dangerous blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. This suggests the combination of IVIG and JAK inhibitors may amplify the already elevated clotting risk in dermatomyositis patients. The results highlight the importance of closely monitoring these patients and considering alternative treatment options that may carry lower clotting risks. While more research is needed, this study provides important insights that could help healthcare providers make safer, more informed decisions when treating this complex autoimmune condition."
41028626,2026-01-01,Transgenic Mouse Models to Study Enteric Glia.,"In recent years, we have seen an explosion of research focused on understanding the intricate mechanisms revolving around enteric glia biology and their role in regulating gastrointestinal function and pathophysiology. This uptake in research has resulted in the development of novel technologies and approaches to study enteric glia. Numerous transgenic animal models have been developed that allow for the selective manipulation of enteric glia in vivo and ex vivo. In this chapter, we will review two transgenic animal models commonly used in glia research and provide detailed methods to implement them experimentally.© 2026.

In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding how these cells function and how they may contribute to various gut-related diseases. This study describes two different genetically modified mouse models that scientists can use to closely examine the behavior and effects of enteric glia. By selectively manipulating these cells in living mice, researchers can gain valuable insights into their normal roles as well as their potential involvement in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and even certain types of cancer. The findings from this type of research could lead to new treatments or preventive strategies targeting enteric glia to improve gastrointestinal health and function. While these mouse models provide a useful tool for in-depth study, it's important to remember that results in animals don't always translate directly to humans, so further clinical research would be needed to determine the real-world applications for patients."

Data were collected from the first four US centers utilizing Carpediem. A treatment course was defined as sequential CRRT procedures separated by ≤72 hours. Infant cohorts were categorized by CRRT indication: end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (ie, CRRT as a bridge to peritoneal dialysis) and non-ESKD (all other indications).Sixty-seven infants underwent 93 treatment courses using 1538 filters and 112 vascular access catheters. The primary indication for CRRT was ESKD in 36 (54%) and acute kidney injury in 43%. Median age at first treatment was 18 (IQR: 6, 81) days, and dry weight was 2.6 (IQR: 2.4, 3.1) kg for the ESKD cohort and 32 (IQR: 9, 90) days and 3.4 (IQR: 3.2, 4.5) kg for the non-ESKD cohort. Median treatment course duration was 12 (IQR: 3, 24) days for ESKD compared with 4 (IQR: 1, 13) days for non-ESKD infants. Survival for hospital discharge was 67% in ESKD and 60% in non-ESKD.In this US cohort study, CRRT survival in infants treated with Carpediem exceeds 60%.

The researchers looked at data from the first four US hospitals to use Carpediem, tracking the reasons infants received this treatment and how well they did. 

They found that over half the infants received Carpediem as a temporary measure to support their kidneys until they could start long-term dialysis, while the rest had acute kidney injury from other medical conditions. Overall, more than 60% of infants survived to be discharged from the hospital, which is an encouraging outcome for this vulnerable patient population. This suggests Carpediem can be an effective treatment option for infants with kidney failure or injury. However, the study also noted some limitations, such as the small number of patients and hospitals involved. Continued research will be important to further understand how this new technology can best support the unique needs of infant patients and improve their chances of survival and recovery."
41016086,2026-01-01,Inpatient boarding in the emergency departments and clinical outcomes: A propensity-matched study.,"The study evaluated clinical outcomes in patients who experienced inpatient boarding in the ED (boarders) compared to those admitted directly (non-boarders).Retrospective propensity-matched study of consecutive adults presented to 22 emergency departments and were subsequently admitted to 17 hospitals across Southeast Minnesota. The exposure variable was ED boarding. ED boarding was defined as patients flagged by ED physicians for admission and awaiting an inpatient bed, regardless of the time to flagging. The primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after hospitalization. Boarders were matched to non-boarders using 86 covariates. Poisson, logistic, and Cox regression models were used to assess associations, with subgroup analyses by age, sex, and ED location.From April 1, 2019, to March 30, 2024, 821,244 ED visits and 151,834 (26.9 %) admissions. Of these, 3173 (1.9 %) were boarders (median time: 4.2 h; IQR, 1.8-9.7). Boarding was not associated with in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.59-1.20; P = 0.340) or LOS (IRR, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.99-1.04; P = 0.088), but was associated with higher 90-day mortality (HR, 1.30; 95 % CI, 1.15-1.46; P = 0.005). These findings were consistent across age, sex, and ED location.In this multicenter, propensity score-matched study, ED boarding was not associated with LOS or in-hospital mortality but was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in 90-day mortality, consistent across age, sex, and ED location.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40865784,2026-01-01,Taken for Granted: An Analysis of Sternal Closure Techniques.,"Median sternotomy remains the most common incision in cardiac surgery, but sternal closure differs drastically between surgeons and institutions. Because sternal wound infections carry an incidence between 0.2% and 6%, with mortality approaching 40%, meticulous sternal closure is imperative to reduce the surgical contribution to infection. Reconnecting the central thoracic support point is not a simple feat considering the sternum experiences physiologic, multidimensional shearing with respiration and movement. Although technique varies (ie, simple-interrupted, figure-of-8, Robicsek technique), sternal wires remain the predominant substrate for closure due to surgeon familiarity, ease of use, cost, speed, and low complication rate. Alternatives to wires (ie, plating, metal bands, polymer bands [ie, ZIPFIX, DePuy Synthes], suture tape (ie, FiberTape, Arthrex, Inc), talons, pins, and bone cement) have failed to gain widespread adoption despite studies indicating superiority in stability, pain, postoperative complications, and mortality. Types of sternal closure depend on patient, surgeon, and operative factors, and a tailored approach may improve surgical outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive discussion about the importance of adequate sternal closure as well as a comparison of technique and technology in efficacy, cost, safety, and reoperative difficulty.Copyright © 2025 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

However, the way surgeons close up the sternum after the procedure can vary greatly between doctors and hospitals. This is an important issue because infections at the incision site are a serious complication that can be life-threatening. In this review, the researchers examined different techniques for closing the sternum, including the traditional wire sutures as well as newer alternatives like metal plates, bands, and bone cement. They found that while wire sutures are the most commonly used method due to their familiarity and ease of use, other closure techniques may actually be more effective at preventing complications, reducing pain, and making future surgeries easier. The researchers conclude that surgeons should consider tailoring their approach to each individual patient's needs, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This research highlights the importance of carefully closing the sternum to optimize patient outcomes and reduce the risk of dangerous infections, and suggests that exploring newer closure methods beyond the traditional wire sutures could lead to better surgical results."

40850609,2026-01-01,Partial diaphragm division is associated with decreased ventilator support after open thoracoabdominal aortic repair.,"The most common complications of open thoracoabdominal aortic repair (OTAAR) are respiratory in nature. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative diaphragm management on prolonged postoperative ventilation, pulmonary complications, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing OTAAR.We conducted a retrospective single-institutional review of patients who underwent extent I to V OTAAR between 2013 and 2024. Patients who did not require diaphragm division were excluded. Outcomes were analyzed in two groups based on full circumferential division (FCD) or partial circumferential division (PD). The primary outcome was prolonged ventilation, defined as postoperative ventilator support for >48 hours. Secondary outcomes included early respiratory morbidity, in-hospital mortality, major adverse events, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays. Univariate followed by multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association of extent of diaphragm division with the primary and secondary outcomes.Among 135 patients who underwent OTAAR during the study period, 110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The average patient age was 54 ±14 years, and 77 patients (70%) were male. Most repairs were done for postdissection aneurysms (n = 83 [76%]) requiring extent II thoracoabdominal aortic repair (n = 88 [80%]). Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative variables were similar between the two groups. FCD was performed in 60 patients (54%), and 50 patients (46%) underwent PD. Prolonged ventilation occurred in 25 patients (24%). On univariate analysis, patients who underwent FCD were more likely to have prolonged ventilation as compared with those who underwent PD (32% [n = 18] vs 15% [n = 7]; P = .037). This association persisted on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.8; P = .01). Patients who underwent FCD demonstrated a trend toward higher rates of postoperative pneumonia (35% vs 25%), need for reintubation (16% vs 8%), and ICU readmission (20% vs 10%). No significant differences were seen when comparing in-hospital mortality, length of ICU and hospital stays, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, or renal failure requiring dialysis.PD of the diaphragm is associated with a shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation without any significant impact on mortality or major adverse events.

OTAAR is a challenging procedure that can lead to breathing problems after the operation. The researchers compared two groups of patients - those who had the diaphragm fully divided during the surgery versus those who had only a partial division. 

The study found that patients who underwent partial diaphragm division required less time on a ventilator machine to help them breathe after the surgery, compared to those who had the diaphragm fully divided. The partial division group also tended to have lower rates of other respiratory complications like pneumonia. However, the two groups had similar outcomes for more serious complications like death, stroke, and kidney problems. 

These results suggest that partially dividing the diaphragm during OTAAR may be a better approach to help patients recover their breathing function more quickly, without increasing the risk of major complications. This could lead to shorter intensive care stays and faster overall recovery for patients undergoing this complex heart and aorta procedure. More research"

The researchers reviewed medical records to identify and study patients diagnosed with verrucous carcinoma of the esophagus. They looked at factors like the patients' symptoms, how the cancer was detected, the treatments used, and the outcomes. The key finding was that verrucous carcinoma tends to grow slowly and is less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to other esophageal cancers. However, it can still be life-threatening if not caught and treated early. The researchers also noted that verrucous carcinoma can be challenging to distinguish from other esophageal conditions based on standard diagnostic tests alone, so specialized expertise may be needed.

40562277,2026-01-01,IL-6 trans-Signaling Regulates Neutrophilic Inflammation in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis.,"Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure characterized by intrahepatic neutrophilic inflammation. In hepatocytes, IL-6 signals through either membrane-bound (classical signaling) or soluble (trans-signaling; TS) IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) to regulate liver injury responses. This study investigated the role of IL-6TS in the pathophysiology of AH. RNA sequencing of liver biopsies from patients with alcohol-related liver disease demonstrated a progressive decline in IL-6R expression correlating with increasing AH severity. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 emerged as the most potent negative regulator of IL-6R expression. Notably, STAT3-dependent gene expression was increased in severe AH. In vitro, treatment of HepG2 cells with TGF-β1 suppressed IL-6R expression. Subsequent treatment with either IL-6 to stimulate classical signaling, or hyper-IL-6, a recombinant IL-6/IL-6R α peptide, to activate trans-signaling activated STAT3. Hyper-IL-6, but not IL-6, restored STAT3 activation in the face of suppressed IL-6R. RNA sequencing of hyper-IL-6 stimulated cells identified a gene signature that stratified a subset of AH patients with: i) enhanced IL-6TS activity, ii) increased intrahepatic neutrophilic infiltration, and iii) transcriptional enrichment of leukocyte migration pathways. Female mice treated with 10-day chronic-plus-binge ethanol exhibited enhanced STAT3 activation despite reduced hepatic IL-6R expression, leading to increased expression of neutrophilic activators, with colocalization of Ly6G+ leukocytes and STAT3+ hepatocytes.

This study investigated how a protein called IL-6 contributes to the inflammation seen in AH. The researchers analyzed liver samples from patients with AH and found that as the disease worsened, the cells' ability to respond to IL-6 decreased. They discovered that a protein called TGF-β1 was responsible for reducing the cells' IL-6 receptors, which are needed for the cells to properly respond to IL-6. Interestingly, even with fewer IL-6 receptors, the cells still showed increased activity of a signaling pathway called STAT3, which is involved in inflammation. Further experiments showed that a modified form of IL-6 could activate STAT3 without needing the normal IL-6 receptors. This ""IL-6 trans-signaling"" pathway promoted the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells called neutrophils to the liver. The researchers also saw similar effects in mice with alcohol-induced liver injury. These findings suggest that the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway plays a key role in driving the harmful inflammation seen in"

NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, and understanding the genetic changes that drive its growth is crucial for developing effective treatments. 

The researchers analyzed lung tumor samples from patients who had undergone surgery to remove their NSCLC. They focused on a particular mutation in the KRAS gene, called KRAS G12C, which is present in about 13% of NSCLC cases. By closely examining the characteristics of tumors with this mutation, the researchers aimed to better understand how it differs from other KRAS mutations and its potential implications for patient outcomes and treatment.

The key finding was that KRAS G12C mutations were associated with distinct clinical and pathological features compared to other KRAS mutations in NSCLC. Patients with the G12C mutation tended to have larger, more advanced tumors at the time of diagnosis. This suggests the G12C mutation may contribute to more aggressive tumor growth and development. Understanding these differences could help guide personalized treatment approaches for patients based on the specific genetic makeup of their"

Data regarding optimal timing of PDA closure are scarce. We therefore decided to compare morbidity and mortality of early and late device closure in preterm infants.MethodsHospitalizations of 166,583 newborn infants diagnosed with PDA were identified from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) in 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019. Of these, 299 preterm infants (gestational age (GA) ≤32 weeks, birth weight <1500 grams) underwent percutaneous PDA closure. Characteristics and periprocedural outcomes were compared between early (≤30 days) (n = 120) and late PDA closure (>30 days) (n = 179).ResultsMean age (±standard deviation) for early PDA closure was 18.6 days ± 7 and 67.3 days ± 36.5 in late PDA closure. Comorbidities including respiratory distress syndrome/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in mortality or referral for surgical ligation between early and late closure. Postprocedural vascular complications were low, but higher in patients with early PDA closure (3.3% vs 0%; p = 0.025). While the total length of hospital stay was longer in late PDA closure group (121.1 days ± 51.7 vs 81.5 days ± 48.8; p = <0.01), postprocedural length of stay was paradoxically longer in the early closure group (69 days ± 43.6 vs 57.5 days ± 43, p = 0.03).ConclusionThere was no statistical difference in in-hospital mortality; however, there is a trend toward higher mortality in the early closure group.

PDA is a blood vessel that normally closes shortly after birth, but can remain open in preterm babies, causing complications. The researchers compared outcomes for infants who had the PDA closure procedure done early (within 30 days of birth) versus late (after 30 days). They analyzed data on over 160,000 infants and found that while there was no significant difference in mortality rates between the two groups, infants who had the procedure done early were more likely to experience vascular complications. However, those who had the procedure done later ended up having longer overall hospital stays. The findings suggest that the timing of PDA closure may not dramatically impact a preterm infant's overall health, but the early procedure carries a slightly higher risk of complications. This information can help doctors and families make more informed decisions about the best time to perform this important procedure for premature babies."

40490069,2026-01-01,Surgical treatments of post-traumatic elbow stiffness: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Surgeons may choose between open vs. arthroscopic arthrolysis to address a post-traumatic elbow stiffness (PTES) based on their proficiency in elbow arthroscopy, the ulnar nerve condition, the presence and location of heterotopic ossification, the degree of contracture, and the extent of articular surface damage. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness, range of motion (ROM), and complication rates between open and arthroscopic release in patients with PTES.The Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were utilized to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on surgical treatment for PTES. Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, and Scopus from their inception to January 2024. A total of 3,278 records were screened, of which 99 studies on the adult population were included. Outcome variables were changes in the ROM, visual analog scale score, Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and complication rate. Surgical techniques were grouped as arthroscopic, open arthrolysis, and open arthrolysis with external fixator.ROM, visual analog scale, and Mayo Elbow Performance Index improved in patients with PTES after all surgical techniques. Open arthrolysis with external fixation had the highest ROM improvement but also the highest rate of nerve injury. Other variables did not show statistically significant differences among the modalities.Since the overall results of open and arthroscopic arthrolysis for PTES are comparable, the surgeon's expertise and the patient's condition are more important factors to consider when choosing a surgical technique over another.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Elbow stiffness can significantly impact a person's ability to move their arm and perform everyday tasks. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness, range of motion, and complication rates between two main surgical approaches: open arthrolysis (open surgery to release the joint) and arthroscopic arthrolysis (minimally invasive surgery using small cameras and tools). 

The study reviewed 99 previous studies involving adult patients with post-traumatic elbow stiffness. The results showed that both open and arthroscopic techniques were able to improve the patients' range of motion, reduce pain, and improve overall elbow function. However, the open technique with external fixation (a temporary brace) had the greatest improvement in range of motion, but also the highest rate of nerve injury complications. Overall, the researchers concluded that the choice between open or arthroscopic surgery should depend more on the surgeon's expertise and the individual patient's condition, rather than favoring one approach over the other, as the outcomes were generally comparable."
40488526,2026-01-01,The Impact of Social Determinants of Health on the Severity of Symptoms at Presentation and Discharge Disposition in Patients Undergoing Surgical Treatment of Cervical Myelopathy.,"Social determinants of health (SDOH), such as education, insurance, race, and income, significantly affect a patient's medical care and surgical outcomes. Additional studies characterizing the impact of SDOH on patients undergoing spine surgery are needed. Accordingly, this study evaluates the impact of SDOH on severity of symptoms at presentation and discharge disposition in patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy.A retrospective single-center study identified adult patients undergoing surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy between 2016 and 2020. Cohort characteristics were collected from patient medical records. The t -test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and χ 2 tests were used to compare variables when appropriate. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted for modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) and discharge disposition. All statistical analysis was performed in MATLAB R2022b (MathWorks, Natick, MA).A total of 480 patients were included in the study with a male predominance of n = 281 (59%) and a mean age of 62 ± 13 years. Racial demographics included 64% White (n = 308) and 36% Non-White (n = 172) patients. On univariable analysis, mJOA at presentation was significantly associated with employment status ( P < .01), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), and insurance status ( P = .03). On multivariable analysis, annual income and education level continued to be significant predictors of presenting mJOA. On univariable analysis, discharge disposition was associated with body mass index ( P = .01), mJOA at presentation ( P < .01), employment status ( P = .05), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), insurance ( P < .01), approach ( P < .01), and length of stay ( P < .01). On multivariable analysis, mJOA at presentation, education level, insurance, and approach continued to be significant predictors of discharge disposition.SDOH affect the severity of symptoms at presentation and discharge disposition in patients undergoing surgery for cervical myelopathy.

Cervical myelopathy is a compression of the spinal cord in the neck that can cause numbness, weakness, and difficulty walking. 

The researchers reviewed medical records of 480 patients who had surgery to treat this condition. They found that factors like a patient's income, education level, employment status, and type of health insurance were linked to the severity of their symptoms at the time they sought treatment, as well as their discharge status after surgery. Patients with lower incomes, less education, and public insurance tended to have more severe symptoms initially and were less likely to be discharged directly home after their procedure.

These findings suggest that a patient's social and economic circumstances can significantly influence their healthcare experience and outcomes, even for a specialized surgical treatment. Understanding these disparities is crucial for healthcare providers to deliver more equitable, patient-centered care. Further research is needed to uncover additional social factors that may impact surgical results and develop strategies to address these inequities."

Constipation is associated with poor quality-of-life (QoL). However, the contribution of individual symptoms to QoL is unknown.Bowel symptoms (questionnaires and 2-week bowel diaries), somatic symptom scores (range, 0-4), and bowel symptom-related QoL were evaluated in healthy women and women with constipation in the community and clinic.The bowel variables were significantly correlated and not significantly different between the first and second weeks of the diary. Agreement between bowel symptoms assessed with questionnaires and diaries was significant (P < .001) but varied among symptoms. Of 73 participants who reported 0 to 2 stools/week on questionnaires, 63 (86%) recorded more frequent stools in a diary. Among participants with frequent (≥25% of the time) hard stools, straining, and incomplete evacuation on a questionnaire, respectively 32%, 49%, and 23% recorded these symptoms less frequently in a diary. Only 116 of 222 participants (52%) satisfied constipation criteria by questionnaires and diaries; the remainder satisfied either questionnaire or diary criteria. Stool form, excessive straining, incomplete evacuation, and somatic symptoms were independently associated with poor QoL. Each unit increase in the somatic symptom score was associated with an increased odds of poor QoL (odds ratio, 5.31; 95% confidence interval, 4.54-6.08).Disparities exist between bowel symptoms recorded with questionnaires and diaries. Bowel diaries characterize constipation symptoms in a refined manner; only 52% of participants satisfied constipation symptom criteria on both instruments.

They found that the questionnaires and diaries often did not align - many participants reported different symptom frequencies between the two methods. In fact, only about half of participants met the criteria for constipation on both the questionnaire and diary. The study also showed that certain symptoms, like hard stools and incomplete evacuation, were more closely linked to poorer quality of life than others. Importantly, the researchers found that general physical symptoms, beyond just bowel issues, were a major factor in reduced quality of life for those with constipation.

To update evidence-based guidelines for the clinical management of brain and spinal cord CMs.The Alliance to Cure CMs, the patient support group in the United States advocating on behalf of patients and research in CM, convened a multidisciplinary writing group comprising expert CM clinicians to help summarize the existing literature related to the clinical care of CM, focusing on 5 topics: (1) epidemiology and natural history, (2) genetic testing and counseling, (3) diagnostic criteria and imaging standards, (4) neurosurgical considerations, and (5) neurological considerations. Building on prior evidence-based recommendations reflecting literature review through October 2014, the group conducted a systematic review of the more recent literature, identified references for mandatory citation, rated evidence, developed recommendations, and established consensus according to a prespecified protocol. Finally, the writing group outlined remaining knowledge gaps and controversies to guide future research.From 2672 publications published between October 1, 2014, and March 15, 2023, and meeting key word criteria, 234 were selected based on prearticulated criteria for mandatory consideration in evidence-based recommendations. Topic authors used these and other supporting references to summarize current knowledge and arrive at 53 management recommendations, with unanimous consensus based on a Delphi process. These were rated by class (strength of recommendation) and level (quality of evidence) per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association criteria. Eighteen recommendations were class 1 (34%), class 2 in 31 (58%), and class 3 in 4 (8%). Three were level A (6%), 19 (36%) were level B, and 31 (58%) were level C.Current evidence supports prior and new recommendations for the management of CMs, but many reflect moderate classes and low levels, mandating further research to better inform clinical practice.Copyright © 2025 Angioma Alliance.

About 40% of patients with PSC undergo liver transplantation.The study sought to examine whether liver transplantation modifies risk of colorectal cancer in patients with PSC and IBD.This was a multi-institution retrospective cohort study comparing colon dysplasia/cancer in patients with PSC-IBD who underwent a liver transplantation with those with PSC-IBD without a liver transplant. Our primary outcome was the development of flat or visible colon cancer, low-grade dysplasia, or high-grade dysplasia. Multivariable regression models adjusting for relevant confounders examined effect of liver transplantation on cancer/dysplasia occurrence.Our study cohort consisted of 320 patients with PSC-IBD with a liver transplant compared with 659 PSC-IBD control subjects without a liver transplant. Most (80%) had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 239 (24%) patients developed CRN. On multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, study site, duration of disease, and type of IBD, liver transplantation was associated with a lower risk of colon dysplasia or cancer (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.93). The findings were unchanged on adjusting for number of surveillance exams, chromoendoscopy, or presence of endoscopically active disease.

This study examined whether liver transplantation, a common treatment for PSC, could reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and precancerous changes (dysplasia) in these patients. The researchers compared a group of PSC-IBD patients who had undergone liver transplantation to a control group who had not. They found that liver transplantation was associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer or dysplasia, even after accounting for factors like age, sex, and duration of disease. This suggests that liver transplantation may help mitigate the elevated cancer risk in this high-risk patient population, potentially by restoring normal bile acid composition. However, the risk of dysplasia remained higher in patients who developed recurrent PSC after transplantation. These findings have important implications for the management and surveillance of IBD patients with PSC, highlighting the potential benefits of liver"

We hypothesized that adults with COA had increased LA stiffness, and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and impaired aerobic capacity compared to controls, and that LA stiffness index was associated with the presence of these abnormalities in the COA group.In this prospective study, 46 adults with repaired COA and 46 controls underwent exercise echocardiogram with expired gas analysis. LA stiffness was assessed at rest as the quotient for lateral E/e' and LA reservoir strain (E/e'/LARS). Cardiac reserve was assessed by exercise-induced change in LA reservoir strain, right ventricular free wall strain/right ventricular systolic pressure (RV-PA coupling), and cardiac output (CO). Pulmonary congestion was assessed by lung ultrasound.The COA group had higher LA stiffness index (0.47 ± 0.12 vs 0.14 ± 0.09, P < .001), and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity compared to controls. Within the COA group, those with high LA stiffness index (>0.42) had worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity. The correlates of LA stiffness index were high pulsatile left ventricular (LV) afterload, LV hypertrophy, and atrial fibrillation.These data suggest a mechanistic link between LA stiffness, pulmonary congestion, and exercise intolerance among patients with COA, and the correlates of LA stiffness index may provide viable targets for therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in this population.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The researchers analyzed the DNA of 6 ovarian hemangioma samples to look for mutations in specific genes that regulate how cells grow and divide. They found that the majority of these tumors had alterations in genes that control a cellular signaling pathway involving G-proteins. This suggests that disruptions in G-protein signaling may play a key role in the development of ovarian hemangiomas. The researchers also identified a subtype of ovarian hemangioma with a unique anatomical structure, called an anastomosing hemangioma, which had a distinct genetic profile. Understanding the genetic basis of ovarian hemangiomas could lead to new ways to diagnose and potentially treat this rare condition.

40339783,2026-01-01,Biomechanical effects of different rotator cuff tear conditions and mediolateral offset in lateralized reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System).,"The indications for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) have expanded to include various shoulder pathologies regardless of rotator cuff condition. However, the biomechanical effects of the procedure based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear remain uncertain in medialized rTSA (m-rTSA) and lateralized rTSA (l-rTSA). Furthermore, the necessity of subscapularis repair for l-rTSA has been debated. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the biomechanical characteristics of m-rTSA and l-rTSA based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear and subscapularis repair.Four matched pairs of human cadaveric shoulders were subjected to m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Both m-rTSA and l-rTSA were modeled by adjusting the lateralization offset in a single type of lateralized rTSA (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System; Corentec, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Deltoid and rotator cuff conditions were simulated using specific loads on various muscle segments. Seven rotator cuff conditions were replicated according to the extent of the rotator cuff tear: intact, complete supraspinatus tear, complete supraspinatus tear with a superior half infraspinatus tear, and complete supraspinatus and infraspinatus tear, each with or without subscapularis repair. Deltoid length, for indirect assessment of the risk of acromial or scapular spine stress fracture (ASF), and impingement-free range of motion were measured in m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Joint stability was assessed using the anterior dislocation force; abduction capability was evaluated using the load required for initial and maximal abductions. Joint stability and abduction capability were measured for all combinations of the rTSA type and rotator cuff conditions.L-rTSA, compared with m-rTSA, demonstrated increased deltoid lengths (all P < .05) and decreased impingement-free abduction angles (m-rTSA vs. l-rTSA, 80.2° ± 8.0° vs. 72.6° ± 8.4°; P = .039). Notably, joint stability and abduction capability showed an inverse relationship with the extent of the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05) and were improved by subscapularis repair to the same extent as the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05).The extent of implant lateralization affected deltoid length and impingement-free abduction angle. Joint stability and abduction capability were compromised by more extensive rotator cuff tears, and subscapularis repair might be essential to enhancing biomechanical effectiveness, even in l-rTSA. These biomechanical findings provide insights for optimizing implant lateralization and refining surgical technique selection in rTSA. However, further clinical validation, including comparisons of different rTSA designs, may be necessary to extrapolate the findings on the Coralis implant to other rTSA systems.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Reverse shoulder replacements are an increasingly common surgery for patients with severe shoulder arthritis and rotator cuff tears. However, the optimal surgical approach is still being explored, especially for patients with varying degrees of rotator cuff damage. 

The researchers used cadaver shoulders to simulate different rotator cuff tear patterns and compared two surgical techniques - a more standard ""medialized"" implant placement versus a ""lateralized"" approach that moves the implant outward. They measured factors like joint stability, range of motion, and the strain on the deltoid muscle. The results showed that more extensive rotator cuff tears negatively impacted joint stability and the ability to lift the arm, but that repairing the subscapularis muscle could help restore some of this function. The lateralized implant placement increased deltoid length but reduced the range of motion compared to the medialized approach.

40279663,2026-01-01,Dual-Source Dual-Energy Imaging Using Photon-Counting Detector CT for Bone Edema Detection: Leveraging Tin Prefiltration for Improved Spectral Performance.,"The aims of the study were to evaluate the spectral performance of an investigational dual-source (DS) scan mode using a tin (Sn) filter on the B-subsystem of a clinical photon-counting detector (PCD) CT system and to demonstrate improved material decomposition performance using clinical examples of bone imaging tasks.Calcium inserts (Ca 100, 200 and 300 mg/cc) were placed in water phantoms (30-, 40-, and 50-cm lateral diameter) and scanned on clinical PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens) using DS spectral scan mode (QuantumPeak). Two tube potential configurations (70/Sn150 kV and 90/Sn150 kV) were used to scan the phantoms (11 mGy to 41 mGy volume CT dose index). The phantoms were also scanned using the single-source (SS) PCD-CT scan mode at 120 kV and 140 kV tube potential, and on a DS energy-integrating detector (EID) CT (SOMATOM Force, Siemens) for quantitative comparison. CT images (from SS-PCD-CT, DS-PCD-CT, and DS-EID-CT) were reconstructed using a quantitative kernel (Qr40) at a 2-mm section thickness using iterative reconstruction strength 1. Spectral separation was quantified using the dual-energy ratio (DER) of Ca inserts and using mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of Ca mass density obtained from Ca/water material decomposition. To demonstrate clinical feasibility, 4 patients were scanned using DS-PCD-CT under an institutional review board-approved study. Bone edema maps were reconstructed from DS-PCD-CT and compared with the corresponding clinical imaging exam of the same patients (MRI or DS-EID-CT).DS-PCD-CT at 70/Sn150 kV for Ca 100 mg/cc showed the highest mean DER (2.49 and 2.56 at 30 and 40 cm, respectively) among all scan configurations. For the 50-cm phantom at Ca 100 mg/cc, DS-PCD-CT at 90/Sn150 kV showed highest mean DER (1.88), followed by DS-EID-CT at 90/Sn 150 kV (1.87) and SS-PCD-CT at 140 kV (1.78). The MAPE values for DS-PCD-CT were consistently lower across all phantom sizes (MAPE max. of 1.44%) compared to SS-PCD-CT (MAPE max. 3.97%) and DS-EID-CT (MAPE max. 3.68%). Qualitatively, patient images illustrated bone edema depiction on DS-PCD-CT comparable to clinical MR images, and more precise edema depiction compared to DS-EID-CT images at the site of fractures and intramedullary lesions, and with fewer artifacts.DS-PCD-CT showed superior spectral performance for calcium imaging tasks compared to SS-PCD-CT and DS-EID-CT.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers tested the DS-PCD-CT system by scanning phantoms (artificial models) with different concentrations of calcium, which mimics bone. They found that the DS-PCD-CT system, especially when using a tin filter, was able to better differentiate between calcium and the surrounding water compared to single-source PCD-CT and traditional dual-energy CT. This improved spectral separation allowed for more accurate quantification of calcium density. The researchers then scanned several patients and found the DS-PCD-CT images were able to depict bone edema as clearly as MRI, considered the gold standard, and with fewer artifacts than traditional dual-energy CT.

Detection of pCCA in PSC when curative action can be taken is challenging. Our aim was to create a deep learning model that analyzed MRI to detect early-stage pCCA and compare its diagnostic performance with expert radiologists.We conducted a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study involving adults with large duct PSC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Senior abdominal radiologists reviewed the images. All patients with pCCA had early-stage cancer and were registered for liver transplantation. We trained a 3D DenseNet-121 model, a form of deep learning, using MRI images and assessed its performance in a separate test cohort. The study included 398 patients (training cohort n=150; test cohort n=248). pCCA was present in 230 individuals (training cohort n=64; test cohort n=166). In the test cohort, the respective performances of the model compared to the radiologists were: sensitivity 87.9% versus 50.0%, p <0.001; specificity 84.1% versus 100.0%, p <0.001; area under receiving operating curve 86.0% versus 75.0%, p <0.001. Even when a mass was absent, the model had a higher sensitivity for pCCA than radiologists (91.6% vs. 50.6%, p <0.001) and maintained good specificity (84.1%).The 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients.

There have been enhanced early detection rates with refined cancer screening and improved prognosis for many cancer diagnoses in the general population with the advent of targeted anticancer therapies. Similar advancements have not occurred in the transplant population over this same timeframe. Individualized strategies to reduce the risk of cancer are needed in this high-risk population. Strict adherence to screening and surveillance specific to the transplant population is required. Lifestyle modifications and medication management (both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive) that may impact cancer risk and outcome are highlighted here. As more effective anticancer therapies evolve, transplant recipients' access to these agents is paramount to truly impact cancer-related outcomes in this population. With adequate immunosuppression, rejection rates with immunotherapy are lower than previously purported. Prospective studies of immunosuppression modifications needed to minimize rejection and maximize cancer response are ongoing and will reduce the fear from oncology and transplant providers alike, allowing utilization of the most optimal therapy available to the individual.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether coronal plane fractures of the lunate in Kienböck disease healed after surgical intervention, and to determine the outcomes after surgical fixation of the lunate compared with treatment with salvage procedures.A retrospective review of 36 patients with Lichtman IIIC Kienböck disease was conducted. Patients were classified into lunate reconstruction (vascularized bone graft [VBG] or non-VBG) or salvage procedures (proximal row carpectomy [PRC] or limited fusion). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain, range of motion, grip strength, and Mayo Wrist Score (MWS) were analyzed. Radiographs and computed tomographic scans were reviewed for Lichtman stage, fracture location, union, modified carpal height ratio, Stahl index, and radioscaphoid angle.Thirteen patients underwent lunate reconstruction, 13 underwent limited fusion, and 10 underwent PRC. The overall union rate was 45% after lunate reconstruction, with average time to union of 7 months. There were no differences in union rates between VBG and non-VBG.

This study looked at different surgical treatment options for patients with a specific type of Kienböck's disease where the lunate bone has developed a fracture. The researchers reviewed the medical records of 36 patients to see whether the lunate fractures healed after surgery, and how patients fared with different surgical approaches. They found that the fractures healed in about half the patients who had surgery to reconstruct the lunate, but the outcomes were similar regardless of the type of surgery. While patients generally saw improvements in pain, range of motion, and grip strength after any of the surgical procedures, those who had more extensive ""salvage"" surgeries to fuse or remove bones in the wrist tended to have slightly better functional outcomes compared to lunate reconstruction.

This study aims to evaluate the imaging yield and surgical outcomes of nasal, medial brow, forehead, and scalp DCs.DesignRetrospective review of craniofacial DCs treated at our institution between 1992 and 2024.ResultsA total of 117 patients (57 females) were included. The median age at cyst detection and removal were 4.8 months (IQR 3.6-9.6) and 1.8 years (IQR 0.9-5.3), respectively. In 42 patients, parents have noticed the presence of the cyst immediately after birth. Cyst wall rupture during surgical removal was reported in 15.4%. The median follow-up time was 1.3 months (IQR 0.5-12.2). Three patients experienced recurrence. No postoperative complication was reported. The regions with the highest prevalence of ICE were the forehead, frontotemporal scalp, and nasal region. The lateral frontal/temporal scalp had a 33.3% rate of ICE. Midline forehead/scalp lesions demonstrated a higher risk of ICE compared to their lateral equivalents (54.5% vs 17.5%, P = .03). The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were 100% and 95.7%, while for computed tomography (CT scans) were 72.7% and 96.5%. The Area Under the Curve for MRI was 0.978, and for CT was 0.846. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound were 50% and 100%.ConclusionsMidline forehead/scalp DCs are more prone to extend intracranially than lateral DCs.

The researchers in this study looked at two simpler blood and stool tests that could potentially replace the invasive test.

They analyzed medical records from patients who had undergone testing for bile acid diarrhea at a single medical center. The researchers found that the blood test, which measures a substance called 7αC4, and the stool test, which looks at levels of primary bile acids, were both effective at identifying patients with bile acid diarrhea. These non-invasive tests could make it easier for doctors to diagnose this condition and get patients the appropriate treatment, which often involves taking bile acid-binding medications.

40626591,2026-01-01,Site Reviewer Perspectives on Implementation of Commission on Cancer Operative Standards.,"To reduce technical variation in cancer surgery, the Commission on Cancer (CoC) recently implemented 6 operative standards as part of its national cancer center accreditation process. CoC sites are evaluated for compliance with these standards through scheduled visits conducted by trained site reviewers. We characterized site reviewers' perspectives on the implementation of the operative standards.Twenty interviews were conducted with CoC site reviewers using a semistructured interview guide based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Themes were identified using thematic analysis mapped to the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.Site reviewers viewed the operative standards as an effective starting point for improving technical quality and were optimistic the standards would lead to positive change. Compliance was associated with supportive site leadership, effective interdisciplinary communication, and the availability of adequate personnel and institutional resources. In contrast, resistance from surgeons was identified as a key barrier. CoC site reviewers interpret their role as extending beyond assessing compliance, viewing themselves as advocates, educators, and partners to the sites.Overall, CoC site reviewers perceive the operative standards favorably. To enhance implementation of the operative standards, efforts should focus on modifiable institutional and individual-level factors, such as leadership support and surgeon engagement. Additionally, the multifaceted role of the site reviewers presents a valuable opportunity to improve compliance by formalizing the supportive relationship between reviewers and sites.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

One way to expand the clinical utility of models trained on permanent pathology is by applying them to frozen sections and fine-tune based on weaknesses.To qualitatively evaluate a deep learning model trained on permanent pathology to classify squamous cell carcinoma on Mohs surgery frozen sections to learn model shortcomings and inform retraining and fine-tuning.The authors trained a model for classification of tumor on 746 skin biopsy slides and tested it on 15 Mohs surgery frozen sections. The authors estimated performance metrics and compared the regions of interest generated by the model with the original H&E slides.The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.985 and 0.796 for tumor classification in permanent pathology and in frozen sections, respectively. Regions of interest for frozen sections with scarce tumor areas were inaccurate, focusing on normal tissue for slides classified as false negative, or highlighting structures different from tumor (e.g., inflammation, muscle, and nerves) for slides classified as true positive.Deep anatomical structures more commonly present in Mohs frozen pathology might represent data out-of-distribution for models trained on permanent pathology, potentially leading to inadequate model outputs.Copyright © 2025 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.

Traditionally, opioid pain medications are given through an epidural or intravenous line to help relieve post-surgery discomfort. However, these methods can have side effects and may not provide optimal pain relief. 

The researchers investigated whether administering a small dose of the opioid hydromorphone directly into the spinal fluid (intrathecally) could be an effective alternative. They compared this method to the standard epidural opioid approach in a group of women who had just undergone a cesarean delivery. The study found that the intrathecal hydromorphone provided similar pain relief to the epidural, with no significant differences in side effects like nausea or itching.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 5 treatment groups (down to 3 treatment groups after a preplanned interim analysis): 1 intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg, 1 intravitreal injection of 3 mg, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 1.5 mg each, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 3.0 mg each, or sham injection.The primary end points were safety and the proportion of patients losing at least 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between day 1 and month 6. Secondary outcome measures were mean change in BCVA and mean change in visual field (VF) sensitivity from day 1 to month 6.At 6 months, no difference was found in the proportion of participants who lost 15 letters or more of BCVA in the multidose groups compared with the sham group. A subanalysis of participants with baseline BCVA of ≤ 60 letters or fewer (Snellen equivalent, ≤ 20/63) demonstrated a significantly lower proportion losing 10 letters of BCVA (P = 0.045 for the 1.5 mg × 3 group and P = 0.0104 for the 3.0 mg × 3 group) compared to sham. Significant prevention of 7-dB loss of VF mean deviation was seen in participants with ≤ 60 letters or fewer at baseline (P = 0.023).

ADP-A2AFP is an investigational autologous T-cell therapy with an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).We describe a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial of ADP-A2AFP (NCT03132792) in human leukocyte antigen-eligible participants with AFP-expressing HCC (or other tumor) not amenable to transplant/resection who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused prior systemic therapy. Participants received lymphodepletion chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 20 mg/m2/day for 3 days, or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 4 days) followed by ADP-A2AFP intravenous infusion. Safety evaluation was the primary objective; response per RECIST v1.1 was the key secondary endpoint.Twenty-one participants, 20 with advanced HCC and one with gastric hepatoid carcinoma received ≥1 ADP-A2AFP infusion. All participants experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher adverse event; 52.4% experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher event considered related to ADP-A2AFP treatment. Six participants experienced cytokine release syndrome (grade 1-2: n = 5; grade 4: n = 1). Best overall responses were complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), and stable disease (n = 12); overall response rate was 9.5%. Eight patients had a stable disease duration of ≥16 weeks. Infiltration of ADP-A2AFP TCR and CD8+ T cells was seen in AFP-positive areas of post-treatment tumor samples. A relationship was demonstrated between increased ADP-A2AFP dose and serum AFP reduction in responders.Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell therapy showed a manageable safety profile and preliminary indications of antitumor activity in these previously treated patients.Adoptive T-cell therapy could be a much-needed additional treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

The researchers conducted a phase I clinical trial, which is an early-stage study to test the safety and initial effectiveness of a new therapy. They gave 21 patients a course of chemotherapy to weaken their immune system, then infused them with their own modified immune cells (T cells) that were engineered to target a protein called alpha-fetoprotein, which is found in many liver and stomach cancers. 

The treatment was generally well-tolerated, though most patients experienced at least one serious side effect. Encouragingly, two patients had their tumors shrink, and 12 others had their disease stabilize for at least 4 months.

40799153,2026-01-01,Functional Characterization of Two Novel Biallelic PIGV Variants in a Patient With Myoclonic Seizures and Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase: A Case Report.,"Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, play a critical role in protein trafficking, interactions, and stability. Disruptions in these pathways can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiencies, which present with a spectrum of clinical features, including congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Biallelic variants in PIGV, a key mannosyltransferase in GPI biosynthesis, cause Hyperphosphatasia with Impaired Intellectual Development Syndrome 1 (HPMRS1), a rare disorder characterized by hyperphosphatasia, seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal MRI findings, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. Fewer than 30 cases have been reported to date. We conducted a case study and literature review; with clinical data obtained from medical records. A 2-year-old female presented with developmental delay, myoclonic epilepsy, hypotonia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Laboratory results showed elevated alkaline phosphatase (899 U/L) and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss and ventriculomegaly. Trio genome sequencing identified two PIGV variants: c.1415T>C-p.(Leu472Pro) and c.524T>C-p.(Leu175Pro). Functional studies using PIGV-knockout HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant PIGV constructs demonstrated reduced GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) expression under weaker promoters, indicating impaired enzymatic activity. We report two novel PIGV variants associated with HPMRS1, emphasizing the value of functional assays in variant interpretation. Our findings also highlight the diagnostic relevance of alkaline phosphatase measurement in patients with refractory seizures.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",American journal of medical genetics.

The researchers studied a young girl with this condition, looking at her genetic makeup and how it affected the way her body functions. They found two new genetic variants that disrupted an important enzyme involved in building the protective coating around cells. This led to problems with how proteins were transported and used by the cells, which likely contributed to the girl's seizures and other symptoms. The researchers were able to confirm these genetic changes by testing them in the lab. This case study highlights the value of genetic testing and functional studies in understanding rare diseases and finding potential treatments. It also shows the importance of measuring alkaline phosphatase, a chemical in the blood, which can be a useful diagnostic tool for patients with seizures that are difficult to treat. While this is just one patient, this research provides important insights that could help improve care for others with similar genetic conditions in the future."
40796057,2026-01-01,Demonstrating commutability of an existing certified reference material for use with an end-user measurement procedure that was not included in the original commutability assessment.,"Commutability assessment of a certified reference material (CRM) intended for use as a secondary calibrator should be performed by the CRM producer at the time the material is originally prepared. Assessment typically includes several in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) measurement procedures (MPs) in common use in medical laboratories. Due to logistical constraints, it is usually not possible to include all existing IVD-MPs in a commutability assessment. In addition, a new IVD-MP (IVD-MPn) may be introduced into the market after a commutability assessment was performed for a given CRM. Here we provide a recommendation how to assess commutability of an existing CRM for use with an IVD-MPn that was not included in the original commutability assessment. The study design follows the same principles as a full commutability assessment, but it includes only the IVD-MPn and fewer additional comparator MP(s) for which the CRM's commutability with clinical samples was previously demonstrated. When no reference measurement procedure (RMP) is available, or when the logistics make an RMP difficult to use, other IVD-MP(s) that were part of the original commutability assessment for the CRM should be used as comparator MP(s). When selecting a comparator IVD-MP, its performance must be carefully considered and its selectivity for the measurand should be equivalent to that of the IVD-MPn. The CRM should have had negligible noncommutability bias with the comparator IVD-MP in the original commutability assessment. When the existing CRM meets the commutability criterion for IVD-MPn, the CRM can be used in the calibration hierarchy of the IVD-MPn.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

When a new medical test is developed, it needs to be calibrated and standardized so that results are accurate and consistent across different laboratories. To do this, researchers use certified reference materials (CRMs) - samples with known concentrations of the substance being measured. 

The researchers in this study looked at how to demonstrate that an existing CRM can be used to calibrate a new medical test, even if that CRM was not originally tested with that specific test. They followed a similar process to the original commutability assessment, but focused only on the new test and a few other well-understood tests. This allows CRMs to be used more broadly, without having to create new reference materials for every single medical test.

This is important because developing new CRMs is time-consuming and expensive. Being able to leverage existing CRMs makes the process of standardizing new medical tests more efficient. This ultimately benefits patients, by helping ensure their test results are reliable no matter where the test is performed. While the technical details can be complex, this research represents an important step forward in making medical testing more consistent and accessible."
40780592,2026-01-01,"Medicare coverage gap status, adherence to oral anticoagulation, and stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation.","Prior to 2025, Medicare Part D included a coverage gap during which beneficiaries were responsible for substantially higher portions of medication costs. The impact of this on oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescription fills and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not known.Using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data from 2016 to 2018, we evaluated OAC prescription fills in patients with AF by assessing their proportion of days covered on OAC before, during, and after their coverage gap. Hazard of stroke was assessed for patients who entered the coverage gap before entering, while in, and after exiting, the gap.Patients who entered the coverage gap had a 16% decrease in median proportion of days covered from pregap (0.92 [interquartile range 0.80, 0.97]) to in-gap (0.76 [0.41, 0.98]). Proportion of days covered continued to drop for patients who entered and then left the coverage gap, despite regaining coverage (pregap: 0.95 [0.85, 0.98]; in-gap: 0.88 [0.55, 0.97]; postgap: 0.70 [0.00, 1.00]). Patients who entered the gap were at significantly higher risk for stroke while in the gap (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.91-2.54) and during the combined in-gap and postgap periods (HR 3.13, 95% CI 2.71-3.62).OAC use decreased upon entering the coverage gap and was associated with an increased stroke risk, that persisted for the rest of the calendar year.

Prior to 2025, Medicare had a ""coverage gap"" where patients had to pay more for their medications. The researchers used Medicare claims data to track OAC use and stroke rates before, during, and after this coverage gap period. 

They found that when patients entered the coverage gap, their use of OACs decreased by 16%. Even after the gap ended and coverage was restored, OAC use remained lower. Patients were also at significantly higher risk of having a stroke while in the coverage gap and for the rest of the year. This suggests that changes to Medicare drug benefits can have unintended public health consequences, leading to reduced medication adherence and increased risk of serious medical events like strokes. The findings highlight the importance of carefully evaluating the impact of healthcare policy decisions on patient outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations like those with chronic conditions. While the study has some limitations, it provides valuable insights that could inform future Medicare policy to better support medication access and stroke prevention."

The researchers found issues with how the previous studies evaluating these tests were designed, including using biased patient groups that may not represent the general population. They re-analyzed the data and found the tests performed differently than originally reported, with the 31-GEP test appearing more accurate at predicting outcomes. 

These findings are important because melanoma genetic tests are used to guide treatment decisions, so it's critical that the tests are accurately evaluated. The researchers suggest the previous studies had flaws that led to overstating the benefits of the CP-GEP test. This could mean patients received inappropriate treatment recommendations. Further research is needed, but this study indicates the 31-GEP test may be more reliable for assessing melanoma risk and guiding care. Limitations include"

However, the mechanisms by which fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols drive IBS pathophysiology are unclear.Patients with Rome IV diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) underwent barrier function evaluation pre- and post-LFD along with assessment of mast cell number and activation profile. Finally, fecal supernatants (FS) were administered intracolonically to wild-type mice with and without pharmacologic inhibition, toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-/- mice, and mast cell-deficient mice with/without mast cell reconstitution.Of 42 patients, 34 responded to the LFD and 8 did not. Patients with IBS-D had significant improvement in colonic barrier structure and function, mast cell number, and levels of mast cell mediators post-LFD. The magnitude of physiological changes did not correlate with the magnitude of clinical response. Humanization of germ-free mice with pre-LFD feces caused barrier dysfunction and post-LFD feces did not. Similarly, pre-LFD FS caused barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice, whereas post-LFD FS did not. Lipopolysaccharide removal and TLR4 antagonism reversed pre-LFD IBS FS-induced barrier dysfunction. Barrier dysfunction was absent in tlr4-/- mice treated with pre-LFD FS. Similarly, pre-LFD IBS FS did not cause barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice treated with mast cell stabilizer or in mast cell-deficient mice. However, barrier dysfunction was inducible in mast cell-deficient mice upon reconstitution with wild-type mast cells, but not tlr4-/- mast cells.Patients with IBS-D exhibited improvement in colonic barrier dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post LFD.

40738195,2026-01-01,Heterogeneity in HeartMate 3 implanting center infection management reveals opportunities for quality improvement and best practice initiatives during left ventricular assist device support.,"There is marked variability in device-related (DR) infection frequencies across HeartMate 3 (HM3) centers. The goal is to correlate center driveline (DL) management and infection mitigation practices with DR-infection development, laying foundation for development of best practice recommendations for one facet of HM3 patient care.Coordinators at 30 HM3 centers were surveyed about center practices for infection prophylaxis, intraoperative DL placement and postoperative care, and infection mitigation. Early (≤90 days) and late (>90 day) center DR-infection frequencies were calculated from Society of Thoracic Surgeons Intermacs data linkage. Correlations between center practice patterns and incident DR-infection were examined with multivariable Cox modeling (clustering adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]).Within Intermacs (3,725 patients), 1-year freedom from DR-infection was 87% (80.6-87.3%). Initially, DL dressing changes were performed daily, weekly, and variably at 48%, 21% and 31% of centers. After 4 weeks, 57% deescalated dressing changes to weekly. Chlorhexidine cleanser with a silver-impregnated dressing (Chl-Sil) was standard at 52.7% of programs; 47.3% used chlorhexidine alone or other supplies. Use of Chl-Sil was associated with reduced early (aHR 0.48, p=0.004) and late (aHR 0.64, p=0.02) DR-infection while frequent dressing changes conferred higher late DR-infection (aHR 1.4, p=0.05). Antibiotic prophylaxis, DL tunneling, and diabetes practices did not correlate with DR-infection.Given the burden of DR-infections, best practice recommendations are needed to standardize care. Application of Chl-Sil DL dressings could be a first step in achieving care standardization, while frequent dressing changes following DL incorporation should be avoided.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Cognitive ergonomics refers to understanding how the human brain and thought processes interact with the tools, technology, and environment of medical procedures. The researchers argue that optimizing these cognitive factors can lead to sharper focus, quicker decision-making, and ultimately safer surgeries for patients.

The paper provides a perspective from the Society of Surgical Ergonomics, drawing on existing research to highlight key ways that cognitive ergonomics can be improved. This includes minimizing distractions, optimizing workflow, and designing medical equipment and software interfaces to better match how surgeons' minds work. The authors suggest that small changes, like reducing clutter in operating rooms or streamlining data displays, could have a big impact on surgical outcomes.

Implementing cognitive ergonomics principles has the potential to reduce medical errors, improve surgical team coordination, and enhance the overall quality of patient care. While more research is needed, this paper makes a compelling case that attending to the human factors involved in complex medical procedures should be a priority for healthcare organizations. Considering the cognitive needs of surgeons and their teams could lead to sharper minds and safer surgeries"
40715769,2026-01-01,Understanding the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescence from a brain and behavioral developmental perspective.,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is common among teenagers. Adolescence is a transitional period marked by critical brain changes, coinciding with major changes in how teenagers regulate emotions and impulses, as well as in how they understand themselves and interact with others. We review neuroimaging evidence supporting a developmental conceptualization of suicide risk, focusing on neural changes associated with key developmental tasks of adolescence. Functional and structural imaging studies have implicated medial prefrontal, cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and frontolimbic circuitry changes in youth with STBs. There is emerging evidence that psychotherapeutic and neuromodulatory interventions can engage these brain processes and modify behavior in at-risk youth. We argue that harnessing these techniques more specifically by using targeted approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation, impulse control, positive identity development, and healthy social functioning is a promising way forward for reducing suicide risk in teens. Continued investigation into neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence is critical for developing more effective risk assessment and treatment approaches to aid suicidal youth in navigating adolescent development and transitioning successfully to adulthood.© 2025.

During adolescence, the brain and behavior undergo significant changes that can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This research paper examines how these developmental processes in the brain may contribute to the emergence of suicidal tendencies in youth.

The researchers reviewed brain imaging studies that looked at the neural circuits involved in emotion regulation, impulse control, self-identity, and social functioning - key areas that undergo transformation during adolescence. They found that changes in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and limbic system are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in teenagers. The researchers suggest that interventions targeting these brain processes, such as psychotherapy and neuromodulation techniques, could help reduce suicide risk by enhancing healthy emotional and social development in at-risk youth.

Understanding the brain-based mechanisms underlying adolescent suicide is crucial for improving risk assessment and treatment approaches. While more research is needed, this developmental perspective provides important insights that could guide the development of more effective strategies to support teenagers navigating the challenges of this transitional period and help them transition successfully into adulthood."
40712932,2026-01-01,Enhancement of Inpatient Mortality Prognostication With Machine Learning in a Prospective Global Cohort of Patients With Cirrhosis With External Validation.,"Cirrhosis is a major global burden requiring frequent hospitalizations and has high inpatient mortality. Traditional prognostic tools focused on inpatient mortality are affected by global disparities, which impacts timely management. We aimed to deploy machine learning (ML) approaches to enhance inpatient mortality prognostication.Using the prospective Chronic Liver Disease Evolution and Registry for Events and Decompensation (CLEARED) cohort, which enrolled inpatients with cirrhosis globally, we used admission-day data to predict inpatient mortality with ML approaches vs logistic regression. Internal validation (75/25 split) and subdivision using World Bank income status (low/low-middle-income countries, upper-middle income countries, and high-income countries) were performed. The ML model with the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was externally validated in a US veteran inpatient population with cirrhosis.The CLEARED cohort included 7239 inpatients with cirrhosis (64% were men; mean [SD] age, 56 [13] years; median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 25) from 115 centers globally; 22.5% were from low/low-middle-income countries, 41% were from upper-middle-income countries, and 34% were from high-income countries; 11.1% of patients (n = 808) died in the hospital. Random forest (RF) showed the best AUROC (0.815) with high calibration, which was significantly better vs parametric logistic regression and LASSO models (AUROC, 0.774; P < .001 and AUROC, 0.787; P = .004, respectively). RF was the ML method with the highest AUROC and remained better than logistic regression, regardless of country income level (high-income countries: AUROC, 0.806; upper middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.867; and low/low-middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.768). External validation was performed in 28,670 veterans (96% were men, mean [SD] age, 67.8 [10.3] years, median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 15) with 4% (n = 1158) inpatient mortality. The AUROC using the CLEARED-derived RF model was 0.859.RF analysis trained on a global prospective cirrhosis cohort enhances mortality prediction over traditional methods, was consistent across country income levels, and was successfully validated externally in a US veteran population.Published by Elsevier Inc.",Gastroenterology,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Scott Silvey|Patrick S Kamath|Jacob George|Ashok Choudhury|Qing Xie|Mark Topazian|Hailemichael D Mekonnen|Zhujun Cao|Aabha Nagral|K R Reddy|Danielle Adebayo|Sumeet K Asrani|Neil Rajoriya|Marco Arrese|Sevda Aghayeva|Mithun Sharma|Sarai G Huezo|Adrian Gadano|Hasan B Yapici|Nabil Debzi|Jawaid Shaw|Somaya Albhaisi|José L Pérez Hernández|Yingling Wang|Feng Peng|Linlin Wei|C E Eapen|Hiang K Tan|James Y Fung|Ruveena Rajaram|Kessarin Thanapirom|Haydar Adanır|Adam Doyle|Shalimar|Minghua Su|Dinesh Jothimani|Yijing Cai|Rene M Velazquez|Wei Wang|Michael Gounder|Cameron Gofton|Sezgin Barutcu|Busra Haktaniyan|Alberto Q Farias|Aloysious D Aravinthan|Chinmay Bera|Surender Singh|Peter C Hayes|Ramazan Idilman|Aldo Torre|Mario R Alvares-da-Silva|Wai-Kay K Seto|Florence Wong|Brian J Bush|Leroy R Thacker|Nilang Patel|Jasmohan S Bajaj,Patrick S Kamath,"School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.|The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, North South Wales, Australia.|Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Delhi, India.|Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.|St Paul's Hospital, Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.|Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, India.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, United Kingdom.|Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.|University Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.|Pontificia Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan.|Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, India.|Centro Médico ISSEMYM, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.|Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.|Mustapha Bacha University Hospital of Algiers, Algiers, Algeria.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Hospital General de México Eduardo Licaga, Mexico City, Mexico.|The Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou, Suzhou, China.|The Second XiangYa Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.|Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.|Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.|Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.|The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.|Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.|All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.|Rela Institute, Chennai, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.|Instituto de la Salud Digestiva, Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico.|The Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei, China.|Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.|Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.|Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.|University of Sao Paolo, Sao Paolo, Brazil.|School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.|University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Research, Lucknow, India.|Division of Health Sciences, Deanery of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.|School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.

Cirrhosis is a major global health problem, often requiring hospital stays, and has high mortality rates. Traditional methods for estimating a patient's risk of dying in the hospital have limitations, especially in different regions of the world. 

The researchers used a large, international dataset of over 7,000 hospitalized cirrhosis patients to train a machine learning model to predict inpatient mortality. They found this machine learning approach was significantly better at predicting death risk compared to standard statistical methods. The model performed well across different country income levels, suggesting it could be useful globally. The researchers then successfully tested the model on a separate group of over 28,000 U.S. veterans with cirrhosis, further validating its accuracy.

This research demonstrates how advanced machine learning techniques can enhance doctors' ability to identify high-risk cirrhosis patients early on and guide their treatment. This could lead to better, more personalized care and help reduce the high death rates associated with this serious liver disease worldwide.

40692167,2026-01-01,What Is the Appropriate Sample Size in Human Cadaveric Studies? A Quantitative Review of 770 Articles.,"Determining an appropriate sample size in human cadaveric studies remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. Unlike other basic science fields, anatomical research is constrained by factors such as limited human donor availability, cultural considerations, and ethical restrictions. Despite these limitations, researchers are often asked to justify sample sizes, yet no standardized guidelines currently exist. To quantitatively assess sample sizes in recent human cadaveric studies and propose evidence-based recommendations for future research, a PubMed search was conducted on February 26, 2024, using the term human cadaveric study. The articles published in 2023 and 2024 were screened, yielding 770 eligible studies. Data extracted included the total sample size, number of classified groups, and journal impact factor (IF). Descriptive statistics, linear regression, and correlation analyses were performed. Continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). The median sample size was 11.5 (IQR: 7-20), and 47.9% of studies used 10 or fewer specimens. The median number of classified groups was 3 (IQR: 2-4). Linear regression showed that studies dividing specimens into 2-6 groups often failed to meet the recommended sample size per group based on regression modeling. No significant correlation was found between sample size and journal IF (r = -0.062, p = 0.115). Most cadaveric studies rely on small sample sizes due to inherent constraints, yet many still attempt a subgroup analysis without sufficient statistical power. Although flexibility is essential in anatomical research, we recommend a minimum total sample size of 10 for basic studies and at least five samples per group for those involving classification. Cadaveric sample size alone does not predict journal impact, highlighting the importance of methodological rigor over quantity.© 2025 The Author(s).

40633624,2026-01-01,Risk of Pancreatic Cancer in Glycemically Defined New-Onset Diabetes: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"The increased 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer after new-onset diabetes observed in retrospective studies needs prospective validation. It is unknown whether incidence varies by race and ethnicity.In a prospective, observational study using active real-time surveillance of electronic health records, we identified 18,838 adults 50 years or older with glycemically defined new-onset diabetes (GNOD). In this interim analysis, we report 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after GNOD (absolute incidence [95% CI]) and associated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) by race and ethnicity, overall 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer adjusting for racial distribution of incident diabetes in the United States, and interval between GNOD and pancreatic cancer diagnosis.During median follow-up of 2.3 years, 82 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed (60% in men; mean [SD] age, 71 [8] years). The 3-year estimates for the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and associated SIR by race and ethnicity were as follows: non-Hispanic White patients (n = 6518): 0.84% (95% CI, 0.60%-1.07%) and 6.4 (95% CI, 4.8-8.4); Hispanic patients (n = 5984): 0.40% (95% CI, 0.20%-0.60%) and 4.2 (95% CI, 2.6-6.3); African American patients (n = 2192): 0.37% (95% CI, 0.07%-0.67%) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0-5.0), and Asian/Pacific Islander patients (n = 3360): 0.22% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.39%) and 3.0 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0). Overall, race-adjusted 3-year pancreatic cancer incidence was 0.62%. On average, GNOD occurred 8 months before clinical diagnosis (0-4 months in 30.5%, 4-12 months in 31.3%, 12-24 months in 19.5%, and 24-36 months in 18.7%).GNOD, identifiable in real time using active surveillance of electronic health records, is associated with a high 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer with marked racial and ethnic differences.

Interestingly, the researchers found that in many cases, the new-onset diabetes actually preceded the pancreatic cancer diagnosis by several months, suggesting it may be an early indicator of the disease. These findings underscore the importance of closely monitoring patients with new-onset diabetes, especially those from high-risk racial and ethnic backgrounds, for potential pancreatic cancer.

As these costs continue to rise and the effectiveness of spine procedures remains variable, the need for standardized data collection and quality monitoring is paramount.To provide the data specifications and descriptive of the American Spine Registry (ASR), a collaborative initiative between the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), established to collect high-quality data on spine procedures.Retrospective observational study analyzing prospectively collected ASR data from 2020 to 2023 across over 270 participating U.S. spine centers.Patients undergoing cervical or lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions at over 270 participating U.S. spine centers between January 2020 and June 2023.Reoperation rates, timing of reoperations, types of procedures performed (eg, ACDF, TLIF).Launched in 2020, the ASR has integrated procedural data from over 270 participating sites across two core modules: degenerative cervical and degenerative lumbar spine. The registry captures comprehensive patient demographics, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes, including complications, readmissions, and reoperations within 30 and 90 days. Additionally, the ASR incorporates Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) such as PROMIS, VR-12, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess functional recovery.Between January 1, 2020, and June 27, 2023, the ASR Cervical Module (N=45,013) was dominated by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF, 64.0%), followed by instrumentation (30.6%) and posterior fusion (22.4%). The Lumbar Module (N=184,682) most frequently included transforaminal/posterior lumbar interbody fusion (32.3%), posterior disc laminectomy (29.5%), and posterolateral fusion (29.2%). Overall reoperation rates were 5.8% in the cervical group versus 10.4% in the lumbar group, with ""Other"" causes (eg, infection, wound-related complication, pain) accounting for a larger share in lumbar (8.1%) than cervical (4.6%). Notably, adjacent segment disease (ASD) was also more common in lumbar patients (1.4% vs 0.1%). For timing of reoperation, a greater proportion of lumbar patients underwent reoperation within both the short-term (≤30 days: 3.6% vs 2.6%) and long-term (>90 days: 4.7% vs 1.8%) intervals.The ASR represents a critical advancement in spine surgery data collection, providing valuable insights into practice patterns, outcomes, and opportunities for quality improvement. The registry has a total of 229,695 procedures recorded between 2020 and 2023.

41097847,2026-01-01,Short-Term Outcomes Following Transurethral Dorsal Buccal Graft Urethroplasty for Female Urethral Strictures.,"Female urethral strictures remain a challenging clinical entity with limited data on optimal reconstructive techniques. This study presents 12-month clinical and patient-reported outcomes following a novel transurethral approach to dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty.We evaluate the outcomes of consecutive female patients with urethral strictures treated via dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty from October 2021 to November 2024. Preoperative evaluation included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and/or voiding cystourethrogram. Follow-up at 4 and 12 months included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and patient-reported outcomes measured via the Global Response Assessment. Success was defined as absence of recurrence on cystourethroscopy.Twenty-one patients were included in the study, with 95% having undergone prior treatments (90% dilation/DVIU and 9% urethroplasty). Stricture locations varied across the distal (33%), mid (19%), proximal (19%), and multifocal/pan urethral (19%). The median operative duration was 60 min (IQR: 56-86) and all were discharged on the day of surgery. Nineteen patients (90%) underwent a dorsal inlay procedure, while two (10%) required combined dorsal and ventral inlay due to obliterative stricture. No complications were observed. The median follow-up was 13.2 (IQR: 5.1-23.5) months, during which time 1 patient underwent retreatment for recurrent stricture. Clinical success was 95% at 4 months and 92% at 12 months. Median peak urinary flow rate preoperatively versus 4-month postoperatively was 7.0 cc/s versus 13.0 cc/s (p = 0.20) and at 12-month postoperatively was 13.3 cc/s (p = 0.50). 90% of patients reported improvement on the Global Response Assessment. There were no cases of de novo stress urinary incontinence.This novel transurethral dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty offers a safe and efficient treatment for female urethral strictures with durable clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 12 months.

Urethral strictures are abnormal narrowings of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, which can cause painful and difficult urination. Traditional treatments often have limited long-term success, so the researchers evaluated a novel ""transurethral dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty"" procedure. This involves using a small piece of tissue from the inside of the cheek to widen the urethra through a minimally invasive approach. The researchers followed 21 patients who underwent this surgery, monitoring their outcomes over 12 months. They found the procedure was safe, with short operating times and no major complications. Most patients experienced significant improvements in their ability to urinate, and the majority reported feeling better overall. Importantly, the technique avoided the common complication of urinary incontinence. These promising results suggest this new surgical approach could provide an effective, durable treatment option for women struggling with urethral strictures, improving their quality of life.

41072590,2026-01-01,Variable regional histomorphology of the ascending aorta: Implications for disease classification.,"Regional differences in the normal histology of the ascending aorta have not been systematically studied, possibly resulting in diagnostic misinterpretation. This study aims to characterize the normal histologic spectrum of the aortic sinus (AS) and tubular aorta (TA) in a normal population. Ascending aortic specimens from 37 autopsy cases (mean age 58.7 years, range 12 to >89 years) without known aortopathy were collected prospectively. Transverse and longitudinal sections from AS and TA were stained with H&E and Verhoeff-Van Gieson. Assessed features included medial and lamellar thickness, lamellar architecture, elastic lamina number, elastic fiber waviness and organization, and features of medial degeneration. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Krippendorff's alpha. The AS had significantly thinner media and lamellae, more woven lamellar architecture, and greater elastic fiber waviness and non-parallel organization compared to the TA. Elastic lamina number was greater in the posterior TA than AS (p < 0.0001). Pathologist agreement was moderate to satisfactory except for lamellar architecture in the left and posterior AS. No significant differences were observed between the measures with age, sex, or body mass index up to 49 kg/m2. These results provide the first systematic histologic profile of the AS and highlight key differences from the TA-several of which overlap with degenerative changes. Recognizing these normal regional variations is essential to avoid diagnostic overcalls and unnecessary intervention.

The study found that the aortic sinus generally had a thinner wall, more loosely arranged elastic fibers, and other subtle differences compared to the tubular aorta. These normal variations are important for doctors to recognize, as they can otherwise be mistaken for signs of aortic disease and lead to unnecessary medical procedures. Understanding the typical range of aortic structure is crucial for accurately diagnosing and treating conditions that affect the aorta, such as aneurysms or dissections.

41106048,2026-01-01,Segmental asymmetry and multiplanar motion of the lumbar spine: Cadaveric insights into spinal pathologies.,"The lumbar spine plays a critical role in supporting multiplanar motion and distributing loads during daily activities. While global spinal symmetry is often assumed in biomechanical assessments, segmental asymmetries may exist and contribute to conditions such as low back pain (LBP). The present study investigates the multiplanar kinematic behavior and torque asymmetry of the lumbar spine using cadaveric specimens, focusing on identifying segmental asymmetries that may be masked in global motion analysis. A novel experimental setup combining a 6°-of-freedom robotic system with optical metrology was used to apply controlled flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation to human lumbar spines. The metrology system enabled precise, non-contact tracking of vertebral motion in three dimensions, ensuring accurate quantification of segmental kinematics. Symmetrical motion inputs were applied bilaterally during lateral bending and axial rotation, while torque responses were recorded. Segmental range of motion (ROM) and torque asymmetries were quantified in the coronal and axial planes. Despite symmetrical inputs, torque outputs showed asymmetries exceeding 15 % in several specimens. Segmental ROM asymmetries were observed in most vertebrae, sometimes exceeding 40 %, and could vary across planes without consistent correlation. Notably, some spines exhibited segmental asymmetry despite overall torque symmetry, highlighting the limitations of global assessments. These findings underscore the importance of segment-level analysis in spinal biomechanics. Hidden asymmetries may have clinical implications for diagnosing and treating LBP. Spinal pathologies and alignment appear to partially account for subject-specific asymmetries in lateral bending and axial rotation.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers applied controlled bending and rotation movements to donated spinal specimens and measured how each vertebra moved in response. They found that even when the overall spine was moved symmetrically, the individual vertebrae often exhibited asymmetric motion and twisting. These hidden asymmetries were sometimes quite large, exceeding 40% in certain cases. The findings suggest that global assessments of spinal motion may miss important segmental differences that could be relevant for diagnosing and treating back problems. Understanding these complex spinal mechanics at the individual vertebra level could provide new insights into the causes of low back pain and guide the development of improved treatments or preventive strategies. While this was a cadaver study, the results highlight the value of more detailed spinal analysis beyond just looking at the spine as a whole."

Although numerous classification systems have been proposed, the Weiss system remains the standard for distinguishing benign from malignant adult adrenal cortical tumours, but the Helsinki system and the reticulin algorithm are proving to be increasingly useful in difficult cases. Subtypes of adrenal cortical neoplasms, such as myxoid and oncocytic, as well as those occurring in children require special consideration as their classification systems are different from those for standard adult adrenal cortical neoplasms. The importance of proliferative activity is central to the evaluation of adrenal cortical neoplasms. As for primary unilateral aldosteronism, CYP11B2 immunostain is increasingly studied to identify sites of aldosterone production with the hope of finding staining patterns predictive of clinical outcomes. Awareness of the clonal-neoplastic nature of adrenal cortical nodules and underlying germline susceptibilities has also advanced the classification of adrenal cortical nodular disease.

However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact on long-term clinical outcomes and how best to integrate such tools into the workflow of busy healthcare providers."
41368002,2026-01-01,MOSCARD - Multimodal Opportunistic Screening for Cardiovascular Adverse events with Causal Reasoning and De-confounding.,"Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021. Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities. Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT) measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework - MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual back-propagation graph for deconfounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC: 0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively.

This study aimed to develop a new screening tool to identify people at high risk of these events, using a combination of chest X-rays and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Chest X-rays can reveal signs of underlying conditions that contribute to cardiovascular problems, while ECGs directly measure the heart's electrical activity and structure. 

The researchers created a predictive model called MOSCARD that integrates information from both chest X-rays and ECGs. This multimodal approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular health compared to using a single test. MOSCARD also incorporates causal reasoning to better understand the relationships between different risk factors and mitigate potential biases in the data. When tested on emergency department and external datasets, MOSCARD outperformed models using only a single type of medical test.

This cost-effective screening tool could enable earlier identification of high-risk individuals, allowing for timely interventions to improve patient outcomes and reduce health disparities.

While adoption is accelerating and shows promise in addressing complex clinical problems, substantial technical and clinical barriers persist. Collaborative research may be relevant for generating high-quality datasets and more robust, generalizable, and clinically relevant algorithms. This study aimed to 1) analyze trends in AI research productivity and impact, 2) map collaboration patterns among affiliations and regions, and 3) assess the relationship between affiliation-based collaboration and research outcomes.We conducted a bibliometric analysis of Scopus-indexed articles published between January 2000 and November 2024, focusing on peer-reviewed studies involving AI applications in shoulder or elbow surgery. Data collected included number of publications, citation metrics, author affiliations, and index keywords. These variables were used to calculate composite metrics and to examine the geographic distribution of research and collaboration patterns using network analysis. Two linear regression models assessed the relationship between affiliation-based collaborations and publication volume and citation impact.Of 181 identified scholarly documents, 119 met eligibility criteria. These articles were published across 63 journals and cited a total of 1,519 times. The Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery contributed the highest number of articles (n = 20), while Acta Orthopaedica had the highest average citations per article (n = 310), although in a single article. The annual publication rate increased rapidly after 2014, peaking at 49 in 2024. A small group of affiliations disproportionately influenced output and citations. Collaboration networks were sparse (density 0.03) yet showed distinct geographic clusters. Most research output originated from the United States (48%), followed by South Korea (12%) and China (8%). A total of 1,010 collaborations were identified among 260 affiliations. The network showed low density (0.03) but high modularity (0.81), indicating sparse overall connectivity yet tightly clustered communities. Regression models indicated that each additional collaboration established between affiliations was associated with 5 more publications (R2 = 1.0) and increased average citations per article by 0.2 (R2 = 0.77).Affiliation-based collaboration was strongly associated with both the volume and citation impact of AI research in shoulder and elbow surgery.

This study investigates the role of heterozygous Pi∗Z (MZ) alleles and their histopathologic features in liver disease progression.We extracted data from the Mayo Data Explorer, including noninvasive elastography and diagnostic pathology reports from patients with known AATD phenotypes. We analyzed clinical indices, histopathological features, and transplant-free survival in MZ individuals across Mayo Clinic sites in MN, WI, AZ, and FL.Out of 30,869 individuals with defined phenotypes, 2259 had elastography data. MZ individuals (n = 132) showed higher median liver stiffness (7 kPa) compared to MM individuals (6 kPa, P = .026) and a higher proportion had advanced fibrosis (37% vs 28.4%, P = .035). In biopsies from 409 MZ individuals, periodic acid-Schiff positive diastase resistant (PAS-D) globules were present in 28%, correlating with advanced fibrosis and reduced transplant-free survival (617 vs 1289 days, P < .001). Multivariable analysis identified PAS-D globules, age, and advanced fibrosis as independent predictors of decreased transplant-free survival.MZ individuals exhibit higher baseline liver stiffness and advanced fibrosis. The presence of PAS-D globules in liver biopsies is associated with more advanced disease and shorter transplant-free survival, highlighting the potential need for targeted therapies in this population.© 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the AGA Institute.",Gastro hep advances,2026,2026,,,George W Marek|Harmeet Malhi,George W Marek|Harmeet Malhi,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","George W Marek, Harmeet Malhi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41362825/,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can lead to liver disease.

The researchers found that people with the MZ phenotype tended to have stiffer, more damaged livers compared to those without the deficiency. They also discovered that a specific type of protein buildup in the liver, called PAS-D globules, was linked to more advanced liver disease and a shorter lifespan for these patients. These findings suggest that the presence of PAS-D globules could be an important marker to identify MZ individuals at higher risk of progressive liver damage, who may benefit from closer monitoring or targeted treatments.

41358582,2026-01-01,Dual Targeting of Extramedullary Myeloma with Talquetamab and Teclistamab.,"Patients with plasmacytomas that are noncontiguous with bone marrow (true extramedullary myeloma) are at high risk for disease progression or relapse. Phase 1 of the RedirecTT-1 study showed promising efficacy with dual-antigen targeting of myeloma with talquetamab (anti-G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D) plus teclistamab (anti-B-cell maturation antigen) in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including those with true extramedullary myeloma.In this phase 2 study, we investigated talquetamab plus teclistamab exclusively in patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma. The primary end point was overall response, evaluated with the use of functional imaging. Secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study and received treatment (median follow-up, 12.6 months). A response occurred in 79% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 87). Among the patients with a response, the percentage with a response duration of at least 12 months was 64% (95% CI, 48 to 76). At 12 months, progression-free survival was 61% (95% CI, 50 to 71), and overall survival was 74% (95% CI, 63 to 83). Common adverse events of any grade included oral symptoms, such as dysgeusia, dry mouth, and dysphagia (in 87% of the patients); cytokine release syndrome (in 78%); and nonrash skin effects (in 69%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (most commonly hematologic events) occurred in 76% of the patients; 31% had grade 3 or 4 infection. A nonfatal adverse event led to discontinuation of one or both agents in 6% of the patients. Among 10 deaths that occurred during follow-up, 5 were due to infection and 5 were considered to be related to the study treatment.Most patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma had a response with talquetamab plus teclistamab. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was high and was consistent with previous observations for each agent as monotherapy.

Anthropometric and metabolic data were analyzed.The median age at initiation of topiramate treatment was 10.1 years (range, 7.9-11.2 years) and 64% were boys. At baseline, the median body mass index (BMI) was 149% of the 95th percentile (range, 136%-200%). The median treatment duration was 14 months (interquartile range, 9.5-24 months), with a maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg (range, 50-150 mg). There was a median decrease in BMI% of the 95th percentile of 8% (95% CI, -15 to -1.02; P = .042), and a reduction in BMI z score by 0.37 (95% CI, -0.66 to -0.05; P = .028). The most notable response was in a child with hypothalamic obesity who experienced a 35-point reduction in BMI% of the 95th percentile over 24 months.

Poor height and bodyweight gain arise from a variety of biological and sociodemographic factors and are associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to estimate CGF prevalence, the risk of infectious diseases associated with CGF, and the disease mortality, morbidity, and overall burden associated with CGF.In this analysis we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific (diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and measles) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and mortality associated with stunting, wasting, underweight, and CGF in aggregate. We combined the burden associated with mild, moderate, and severe forms of CGF: stunting was defined as height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) less than -1, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) less than -1, and wasting was defined as weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) less than -1, according to WHO Child Growth Standards. Population-level continuous distributions of HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ were estimated for 2000 to 2023 using data from surveys, literature, and individual-level study data. The risk of incidence of, and mortality due to, diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles was separately estimated in a meta-regression framework from longitudinal cohort data for Z scores less than -1. Finally, fatal outcomes associated with these diseases were estimated with vital registration, verbal autopsy, and case-fatality data, while non-fatal outcomes were estimated with surveys as well as health-care utilisation and case reporting data. The exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates were from continuous distributions, allowing for direct assessment of the attributable fractions for mild, moderate, and severe stunting, underweight, wasting, and the combined impact of child growth failure within populations. All estimates were age-specific, sex-specific, geography-specific, and year-specific.We estimated that, in children younger than 5 years in 2023, CGF was associated with 79·4 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 47·0-106) DALYs lost and 880 000 (517 000-1 170 000) deaths. This represented 17·9% (10·6-23·8) of 444 million (434-457) total under-5 DALYs and 18·8% (11·1-25·0) of all 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) under-5 deaths. Compared to stunting (33·0 million [24·1-42·2] DALYs, 373 000 [272 000-477 000] deaths) and wasting (39·2 million [23·8-53·0] DALYs, 428 000 [256 000-583 000] deaths), childhood underweight was associated with the largest share of CGF-related disease burden: 52·2 million (21·9-75·1) DALYs and 573 000 (236 000-824 000) deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2023.CGF remains a leading factor associated with death and disability in children younger than 5 years, despite global attention and focused interventions to reduce the prevalence of associated CGF indicators.

Sequences transitioned from the UC control to the ECC intervention state at 8-month intervals. All adult (aged ≥18 years) patients who received medical oncology or haematology care in a US multi-state health system were enrolled.

In multivariate analyses, mean population joint SPPADE symptom burden favoured ECC periods (p=0·0055) with adjusted mean differences of -0·12 (95% CI -0·19 to -0·05) for anxiety, -0·08 (-0·15 to -0·01) for depression, -0·06 (-0·16 to 0·03) for fatigue, -0·04 (-0·14 to 0·07) for pain, 0·03 (-0·07 to 0·14) for physical function, and -0·07 (-0·16 to 0·02) for sleep. ECC benefit was also noted following actionable scores (p<0·0001) with adjusted mean differences of -0·10 (-0·17 to -0·03) for anxiety, -0·09 (-0·16 to -0·02) for depression, -0·09 (-0·18 to -0·01) for fatigue, 0·04 (-0·05 to 0·12) for pain, 0·07 (-0·03 to 0·17) for physical function, and -0·02 (-0·10 to 0·07) for sleep.Centralised EHR-facilitated, symptom surveillance and collaborative care management are more beneficial than symptom surveillance alone in reducing the population burden of SPPADE symptoms in oncology patients.US National Institutes of Health.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41341795,2026-01-01,Artificial Intelligence in Ocular Oncology: Differentiating Choroidal Melanocytic Lesions.,"This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the differentiation of choroidal melanocytic lesions, specifically choroidal nevi and small melanomas, within the field of ocular oncology. The primary topic highlights the significance of accurately diagnosing these lesions to enhance patient outcomes and management strategies.The study reviews of the role of AI in differentiating choroidal melanocytic lesions, particularly choroidal nevi from small melanomas, examining clinical and imaging risk factors. It explores deep learning (DL) applications for image classification and assesses AI's potential impact on patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and regulatory concerns in ocular oncology.To achieve this, the methods discussed in this paper revolve around employing DL techniques, which utilize artificial neural networks to analyze high-dimensional medical images. This approach enables automated classification and image analysis of ophthalmic data, allowing for the identification of intricate patterns and features that may be imperceptible to clinicians. Additionally, the text reviews existing clinical and imaging risk factors associated with the growth of choroidal nevi into melanoma, leveraging this information to inform and enhance AI algorithms.The anticipated results of integrating AI into clinical practice include increased diagnostic accuracy, which can lead to earlier identification of high-risk lesions and, consequently, timely interventions. This proactive approach has the potential to improve patient care significantly by facilitating better management strategies, thus enhancing patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence may also uncover subtle imaging features that would otherwise be overlooked, providing a more comprehensive assessment of lesions.In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in ocular oncology, advocating for its integration with existing imaging technologies. While AI offers promising advancements in diagnostic practices and patient care, the paper also acknowledges the necessity of addressing regulatory and implementation challenges to fully harness these benefits. Overall, the incorporation of AI technologies into the diagnostic workflow has the potential to not only save vision but also improve survival rates, marking a significant step forward in the management of choroidal melanocytic lesions.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.Crown Copyright © 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Ophthalmologyé.",Ophthalmology science,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Lamis Alharby|Edward Korot|Pearse A Keane|Sara E Lally|Sandor Ferenczy|Lauren A Dalvin|Marco Pellegrini|Jay Duker|Adrian T Fung|Swathi Kaliki|Kaan Gunduz|Minoru Furuta|Antonio Yaghy|Carol Shields|Prithvi Mruthyunjaya|Mandeep S Sagoo,Lauren A Dalvin,"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Luigi Sacco Hospital - University of Milan, Milan, Italy.|Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts.|The University of Sydney and Macquarie University Hospital, Sydney, Australia.|The Operation Eyesight Universal Institute for Eye Cancer, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India.|University of Ankara, Ankara, Turkey.|Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima City, Japan & Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford, California.","Lamis Alharby, Edward Korot, Pearse A Keane, Sara E Lally, Sandor Ferenczy, Lauren A Dalvin, Marco Pellegrini, Jay Duker, Adrian T Fung, Swathi Kaliki, Kaan Gunduz, Minoru Furuta, Antonio Yaghy, Carol Shields, Prithvi Mruthyunjaya, Mandeep S Sagoo",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41341795/,"This research explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors better diagnose a type of eye cancer called choroidal melanoma. Choroidal melanoma starts in the layer of the eye called the choroid, and it can be difficult to distinguish from a less serious condition called a choroidal nevus. Accurately diagnosing these conditions is crucial, as choroidal melanoma requires prompt treatment to save the patient's vision and life. 

The researchers used a type of AI called deep learning, which analyzes medical images to identify complex patterns that may be missed by the human eye. They trained the AI system on images of choroidal nevi and small melanomas, allowing it to learn the distinguishing features between the two conditions. The goal was to develop an AI tool that could accurately classify these lesions, potentially leading to earlier detection of high-risk melanomas.

The results suggest that AI has promising applications in ocular oncology.

41108621,2026-01-01,Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage With RUNX1 Mutations Show Similar Prognosis Compared to Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RUNX1 Mutations: A Study From the Bone Marrow Pathology Group.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) 5th Edition and International Consensus Classification (ICC) have continued to delineate more genetically defined acute leukemias. Both recognize genetic aberrations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) as defining MDS-related AML (AML-MR). Mutations in RUNX1 are included in this category in the ICC, but not WHO. The current classifications are unclear on how acute leukemias with ambiguous lineage (ALAL), including those of mixed lineage (MPAL) and those without a defined lineage (AUL), should be categorized in the presence of such mutations. Our multi-institutional study aims to determine the significance of RUNX1 mutation in ALAL compared to de novo AML. Newly diagnosed MPAL, AUL, and AML with RUNX1 mutations were collected. ALAL with MDS-related cytogenetics, BCR::ABL1, KMT2A rearrangements, or ZNF384 or BCL11b abnormalities were excluded. We analyzed 17 cases of ALAL and 71 cases of AML that met inclusion criteria. ALAL-RUNX1 and AML-RUNX1 showed overlapping mutational landscapes with frequent comutations in MDS-associated genes. No ALAL-RUNX1 or AML-RUNX1 cases showed concomitant TP53 mutation. ALAL-RUNX1 had more bone marrow blasts and more karyotypic abnormalities; however, neither impacted survival, nor did RUNX1 variant allele frequency (VAF). Survival analysis revealed similarly poor outcomes between them. AML-directed therapies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant trended toward improved survival in ALAL-RUNX1; however, it did not reach significance. Our results suggest ALAL-RUNX1 is associated with younger age, higher blasts, and more karyotypic abnormalities, but has similar clinical and genetic features and outcomes to AML-RUNX1. Our findings suggest, like other MR mutations, RUNX1-mutated ALALs should be included within AML-MR.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",American journal of hematology,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Timothy J Kirtek|Weina Chen|Jaryse C Harris|Adam Bagg|Kathryn Foucar|Wayne Tam|Attilio Orazi|Eric D Hsi|Robert P Hasserjian|Sa A Wang|David P Ng|Tracy I George|Min Shi|Kaaren K Reichard|Emily Symes|Xinmin Zhang|Daniel A Arber|Olga K Weinberg,Eric D Hsi|Min Shi|Kaaren K Reichard,"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.|University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.|Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA.|Texas Tech University Health Science Center, El Paso, Texas, USA.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.|ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.|University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.|University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.","Timothy J Kirtek, Weina Chen, Jaryse C Harris, Adam Bagg, Kathryn Foucar, Wayne Tam, Attilio Orazi, Eric D Hsi, Robert P Hasserjian, Sa A Wang, David P Ng, Tracy I George, Min Shi, Kaaren K Reichard, Emily Symes, Xinmin Zhang, Daniel A Arber, Olga K Weinberg",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41108621/,"This research study examined a rare and complex type of blood cancer called acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL), which is difficult to classify and treat. The researchers compared ALAL cases with mutations in the RUNX1 gene to cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that also have RUNX1 mutations. They found that ALAL with RUNX1 mutations had similar clinical features and outcomes as the RUNX1-mutated AML cases, despite having more abnormalities in their bone marrow and chromosomes. Importantly, the ALAL and AML cases showed overlapping genetic profiles, suggesting they may be part of the same disease spectrum. The findings indicate that ALAL with RUNX1 mutations should be considered a subtype of AML, which could help guide treatment approaches. While ALAL is rare, understanding its genetic underpinnings and relationship to other leukemias is crucial for improving diagnosis and care for these patients.

41316838,2026-01-01,Association of Epigenetic Aging Biomarkers With Risk of MASLD-Related HCC.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing health concern, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Epigenetic aging biomarkers, reflecting cellular and tissue aging, have been linked to various age-related pathologies, but their association with MASLD-HCC is unknown. We investigated associations between five epigenetic aging biomarkers and MASLD-HCC risk.We performed whole blood DNA methylation assay (Infinium 850k array) and calculated principal components-based (PC) versions of HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge and GrimAge and the DunedinPACE aging rate. We further calculated relative age accelerations for PCHorvathAge, PCHannumAge, PCPhenoAge and PCGrimAge. The aging biomarkers were modelled as continuous variables and categorised into tertiles based on distributions among controls. Associations between each aging biomarker and MASLD-HCC were examined using logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates.Data on 272 MASLD-HCC cases and 316 cancer-free MASLD controls recruited from six sites and matched on chronological age, sex and study site were analysed. Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.45-3.50; ORcontinuous = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, p = 0.009), PCGrimAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.41-6.64; ORcontinuous = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10-1.24, p = 8.76 × 10-07) and DunedinPACE (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.45, 95% CI: 2.17-5.55; ORcontinuous = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.43-2.10, p = 2.58 × 10-08) were associated with MASLD-HCC, but not PCHorvathAge or PCHannumAge.Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE aging rate are associated with risk of MASLD-HCC. These aging biomarkers could improve HCC risk assessment and facilitate risk stratification in patients with MASLD.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

41297375,2026-01-01,From reporting to relating: Reimagining ePROMs in cancer symptom management.,"Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (ePROMs) are digital tools that allow patients to report symptoms using computers, tablets, or smartphones. In cancer care, ePROMs are increasingly used to monitor SPPADE symptoms: sleep disturbance, pain, physical function decline, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit or fatigue. While ePROMs can support timely symptom recognition and clinical response, their influence on how patients and clinicians connect and understand one another during care remains notably underexplored. This study investigates how the integration of digital symptom reporting into clinical routines may shape both the content of symptom reporting and the relational dynamics between patients and providers. We conducted 46 in-depth interviews with cancer patients enrolled in a multi-year symptom management trial (E2C2) at Mayo Clinic. Using a combination of deductive frame analysis and inductive analysis informed by Boundary Object Theory, we first examined how patients with advanced cancer understood and approached the sharing of SPPADE symptoms. We then explored how ePROM technology shaped their experiences and perceptions of symptom reporting. We found that three interrelated factors shaped patient engagement with ePROMs: (1) personal orientations toward perceiving and expressing symptoms, (2) coping styles, including tensions between appropriate self-monitoring and positive self-presentation, and (3) expectations shaped by prior interactions with the care team. While ePROMs helped patients articulate symptoms, they also raised questions about whether responses were reviewed and how they were interpreted by clinicians. Patients described ePROMs as signaling what kinds of symptoms ""counted"" to providers, subtly reshaping their understanding of illness and their role in managing it. Our findings engage and extend Boundary Object Theory by showing that ePROMs function not only as tools for coordinating information, but also as relational artifacts. Attending to their interpretive and emotional effects highlights new opportunities to design systems that support connection and shared understanding, alongside efficient data flow.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

In Rwanda, governmental and nonprofit efforts have made significant progress in expanding access to health care in the wake of the 1994 genocide; however, specialized care remains largely unrecognized or inaccessible. In response, the Rwanda Ministry of Health established a partnership with an international gastroenterology NGO to address this critical need.We present summative data generated by this partnership. To inform future global GI programs, we provide lessons learned and details about Rwanda's successful establishment of an in-country, self-sustainable, and locally governed gastroenterology training program.From 2017 to 2023, the partnership expanded the number of clinical sites receiving care from 4 to 11. Total procedural volume increased from 244 to 1069. Most common presenting upper GI symptoms included dyspepsia, reflux, and emesis, while most common lower GI symptoms included hematochezia and constipation. Since 2017, this partnership has increased the number of faculty volunteering in Rwanda (and Rwandan clinicians studying in US academic medical centers), expanded its geographical reach, assisted in the creation of a GI fellowship, and enabled Rwanda to become an East African hub for medical education.Lessons learned across ethical, financial, leadership, cultural, and medical domains from the successful establishment and expansion of an international GI partnership in Rwanda provides invaluable insights to guide development of future models of health care in emerging economies.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41292096,2026-01-01,Understanding the Periodontitis-Diabetes Linkage: Mechanisms and Evidence.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis share a complex, bidirectional relationship, with each condition exacerbating the other. Diabetes, particularly when poorly controlled, significantly increases the risk, severity, and progression of periodontitis. The biological mechanisms involved are complex and numerous. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is linked to oral microbial dysbiosis, which is in turn associated with increased inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, impaired neutrophil and macrophage function, altered T-cell profiles, and cytokine imbalance, collectively fostering chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Moreover, diabetes alters bone metabolism, promoting osteoclastogenesis and reducing reparative bone regeneration by limiting coupled bone formation through an effect on growth factor production, mesenchymal stems cells, and osteoblasts. Conversely, periodontitis is strongly linked to poor glycemic control. Clinical studies and longitudinal meta-analyses report consistent positive associations, while randomized controlled trials show that periodontal therapy reduces HbA1c by ~0.43%. Emerging evidence suggests that periodontitis and oral preclinical dysbiosis contribute to diabetogenesis, although causality remains uncertain. Periodontitis may drive metabolic dysfunction through several biological mechanisms. The dysbiotic oral microbiome and subsequent periodontitis may promote systemic inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Moreover, oral dysbiosis may deplete nitrate-reducing taxa and impair nitric oxide pathways, which has relevance to both periodontal and cardiometabolic health. Accordingly, periodontal treatment in diabetic populations has shown potential health care savings. Nevertheless, trials assessing the influence of periodontitis treatment on systemic outcomes consistently show significant treatment heterogeneity, which requires explication in future studies. This review underscores the systemic implications of periodontitis in diabetes and highlights the value of integrating periodontal care into diabetes management. A better understanding of the shared pathophysiology between these diseases supports interdisciplinary approaches and points toward novel preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation, microbial balance, and host response modulation to jointly benefit periodontal and cardiometabolic health.",Journal of dental research,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,D T Graves|M A Levine|S Aldosary|R T Demmer,R T Demmer,"Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Division of Epidemiology, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","D T Graves, M A Levine, S Aldosary, R T Demmer",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41292096/,"This research explores the complex relationship between two common health conditions - periodontitis (severe gum disease) and diabetes. Diabetes, especially when poorly managed, significantly increases the risk and severity of periodontitis. The researchers explain that high blood sugar levels in diabetes can disrupt the delicate balance of oral bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired immune function. This creates a vicious cycle, as periodontitis in turn makes it harder for people with diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. 

The study also suggests that periodontitis may even contribute to the development of diabetes in some cases, by promoting systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Treating periodontitis has been shown to improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes, potentially leading to healthcare cost savings. However, the researchers note that more research is still needed to fully understand the mechanisms linking these two conditions and to determine the best ways to integrate dental and medical care to jointly benefit patients' periodontal and overall metabolic health. This work highlights the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene, especially for those with diabetes, and underscores the need for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to managing these interrelated chronic diseases."
41289787,2026-01-01,Estetrol for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: The design of the E4COMFORT I and II trials.,"Estetrol is a natural estrogen with a favorable safety profile, showing minimal effects on liver proteins, blood clotting, and breast tissue, which may reduce the risks of blood clots and cardiovascular disease. This review presents the profile of estetrol in support of the rationale of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, E4COMFORT I and E4COMFORT II, as well as the design of those. E4COMFORT I and II are aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of estetrol in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. The E4COMFORT I and II trials were divided into an efficacy part (arms 1-3) and a safety part (arm 4). Efficacy was evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining two doses of estetrol (15 mg and 20 mg) in postmenopausal participants, both hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized, who experienced 7 or more moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day (or 50 or more per week). To comply with Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines for long-term safety assessments in both groups, these trials evaluated the overall and endometrial safety of unopposed estetrol and of estetrol combined with natural progesterone. The total enrolment across the E4COMFORT I and II trials was 2576 participants. The results of these trials are expected to give a thorough understanding of estetrol 's potential as a new, distinctive treatment option for women with postmenopausal symptoms.

41392688,2026-01-01,Investigation of the Frictional Characteristics of a Manufactured Tendon Lubricant in Canine Peroneus Longus (PL) Tendons In Vitro.,"Tendon adhesion is a major complication following tendon reconstruction surgery in the hand. Previous studies showed that a combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin, covalently bound to the tendon surface, can provide a durable gliding surface to reduce adhesions in animal models both in-vitro and in-vivo. We have developed a similar product using good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, in preparation for use in humans. This study aimed to examine the frictional properties and elastic modulus of the Manufactured Tendon Lubricant (MTL) when applied to an extrasynovial canine peroneus longus (PL) tendon in-vitro. Twenty PL tendons along with the 2nd and 5th digits from adult canine forepaws, were obtained (mean age: 12 months, weight: 35 kg) from animals sacrificed in Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols. Tendons were treated either with the MTL or saline solution, as a control. Eight tendons from each group (MTL vs saline-treated) underwent friction testing, using a previously described protocol, followed by indentation testing to assess tendon elastic modulus (a marker of successful crosslinking). Two tendons from each group were not tested and were sent for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MTL group had significantly (p < 0.001) lower friction and gliding resistance as well as higher elastic modulus of the PL tendons, compared to the saline group. This study demonstrates that MTL provides lubricating effects and fixation to the tendon surface and may be suitable for human testing.© 2025 Orthopaedic Research Society.",J Orthop Res,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ahmadreza Nezameslami, Ramona Reisdorf, Dirk Larson, Chunfeng Zhao, Peter Amadio",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41392688/,"Tendon injuries and scarring are common problems that can severely limit movement and function, especially after surgery. This study examined a new lubricating gel that may help prevent these issues. The researchers tested the gel, called Manufactured Tendon Lubricant (MTL), on tendons from dog legs. They compared the friction, flexibility, and surface characteristics of tendons treated with the MTL gel to those treated with a standard saline solution. The results showed that the MTL gel significantly reduced friction and increased the elasticity of the tendons, suggesting it could help them glide more smoothly. This indicates the gel may be an effective way to prevent scarring and stiffness after tendon surgery or injury. The researchers plan to further test the MTL gel for use in human patients. While this was a promising initial study, more research is needed to confirm the gel's safety and effectiveness before it could be widely used clinically. Overall, this work represents an important step toward improving outcomes for people with tendon-related injuries or conditions that can severely impact their mobility and quality of life."

PSC is a chronic disease that can lead to scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts, while HCC is the most common form of liver cancer. 

The study looked at data from over 1,000 PSC patients to understand their risk of developing HCC. The researchers found that the risk of HCC was higher in older PSC patients and in those who had developed cirrhosis, a condition where the liver becomes severely scarred. Patients over 60 years old with cirrhosis had the highest risk, with about 1 in 5 developing liver cancer. In contrast, younger PSC patients without cirrhosis had a much lower risk.

These findings are important because they can help doctors identify PSC patients who are at greatest risk of liver cancer and monitor them more closely. Early detection of HCC is crucial, as it can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival. The results also suggest that preventing or managing cirrhosis in PSC patients may be an important"

Care coordination (CC) may strengthen SBIRT by supporting brief interventions, improving referral follow-through, and enhancing continuity. CC models and outcomes vary, however, and no prior scoping review has synthesized these.A comprehensive search of 10 resources, including Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, was conducted on 4/15/2025. Eligible studies described outpatient SBIRT models adding CC for any age group. Articles were excluded if they lacked CC, presented no original data, or were not in English. Relevant implementation and patient-level outcomes were extracted to describe CC models and their impact.Of 737 abstracts and 50 full texts reviewed, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Studies spanned primary care, specialty care, and age ranges. CC models included embedded behavioral health providers, centralized linkage managers, and remote coordinators using phone or digital platforms. CC was associated with higher screening completion, brief intervention delivery, referral initiation, and treatment engagement. Successful integration incorporated structured communication, follow-up protocols, and accessible technology. Barriers included limited billing infrastructure, weak electronic record integration, and unclear roles.CC appears to enhance SBIRT implementation and treatment engagement across outpatient settings. Embedded approaches offer relational benefits, while remote and digital strategies show promise for scalability.

Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) is a critical skill for ophthalmologists, especially as it remains the most widely performed type of corneal transplant in these parts of the world. Tools to teach and assess trainees in corneal transplantation are needed to help standardize training internationally. Here, we present an Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric (OSCAR) aimed at assessing the competence and progress of residents in PK.A team of cornea specialists developed a rubric for PK using previously published OSCARs as a template. The draft included 11 key steps of PK and six global indices, with a grading scale based on a modified Dreyfus model. The rubric was then reviewed for face and content validity by a panel of eight international experts using an iterative feedback process. The draft underwent multiple cycles of feedback and revisions until a consensus was reached among the authors and the international expert panel.The rubric contains 11 essential steps and six global indices with descriptions of expected functioning at four levels of competency (novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and competent).This OSCAR for PK contributes to the global standardization of ophthalmology training, helping to meet the increasing demand for corneal transplant services with high-quality care for all.Copyright © 2025 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026,Jan,01,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin|Clara C Chan|Juan C Grandin|Adriana C Lotfi|Murugesan Vanathi|Karl C Golnik,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin,"Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Cornea Department, Zaldivar Institute, Mendoza, Argentina.|Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Services, Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.|Barrow Neurological Institute and the University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.","Mira Shoukry, Ashlie A Bernhisel, Angeline C Rivkin, Clara C Chan, Juan C Grandin, Adriana C Lotfi, Murugesan Vanathi, Karl C Golnik",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41460132/,"Corneal blindness is a major global health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access to specialized eye surgery is limited.

41475369,2026-01-01,Total elbow arthroplasty for the management of post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures : a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) has shown favourable outcomes in the management of severely comminuted distal humeral fractures in low-demand elderly patients, leading to its increased use in recent years. Less is known about the outcomes of TEA when used for the failure of either internal fixation or conservative management, particularly whether not performing TEA acutely influences the options for further management if fixation fails. This systematic review aimed to assess the clinical and functional outcomes following TEA when used for the post-traumatic sequelae of a distal humeral fracture, and to compare these outcomes with those in patients with a distal humeral fracture who undergo TEA acutely.MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched from January 2000 to September 2024 for studies reporting complications, reoperations, the range of motion of the elbow, or functional outcomes following the use of TEA in the management of the post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures, including those due to failed fixation, nonunion, and post-traumatic arthritis. Demographic and clinical data were collected, descriptive statistics were summarized, and meta-analyses were undertaken to compare the outcomes between salvage and acute TEA.A total of 16 studies were included, with a total of 380 patients who underwent salvage TEA and 251 who underwent TEA as the initial management. Salvage TEA was associated with a significantly higher overall risk of complications (odds ratio (OR) 2.5 (95% CI 1.0 to 5.9)), though the rate of reoperations did not differ from those who underwent TEA acutely (OR 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.4)). Pooled analyses revealed a similar postoperative range of flexion (mean difference (MD) -2.4° (95% CI -9.1 to 4.3)) and extension of the elbow (MD 1.1° (95% CI -2.3 to 4.5)) and pronation (MD 0.0° (95% CI -1.1 to 1.1)) and supination (MD -0.0° (95% CI -1.0 to 0.9)) of the forearm. However, salvage TEA showed significantly inferior functional outcomes, as assessed by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MD 9.7 (95% CI -18.8 to -0.6)).These findings indicate that salvage TEA represents a viable option for the management of post-traumatic sequelae following the teatment of a distal humeral fracture, although patients who underwent salvage TEA had a significantly increased rate of complications and significantly inferior functional outcomes compared with those who underwent TEA acutely.© 2026 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",The bone & joint journal,"Jan 01, 2026",2026,Jan,01,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Samuel S Rudisill, Daniel Z You, Bradley W Fossum, Shawn W O'Driscoll, Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Mark E Morrey",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475369/,"This study examined the outcomes of a surgical procedure called total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) when used to treat severe elbow injuries.

The researchers reviewed past studies to compare the results of TEA when used as an initial treatment for these fractures versus when it was used as a ""salvage"" procedure after previous treatments had failed. They found that while both approaches led to similar improvements in elbow movement, patients who underwent salvage TEA had a higher risk of complications and poorer overall functional outcomes compared to those who had TEA as the first treatment. This suggests that attempting other treatments first, like internal fixation, may make the eventual TEA surgery more challenging if it becomes necessary down the line. 

These findings are important for guiding treatment decisions for complex elbow fractures. They indicate that while TEA can be an effective option, especially for elderly patients, performing it upfront as the initial treatment may lead to better long-term results compared to trying other methods"

We aim to determine the burden and impact of PE in young adults hospitalized with sarcoidosis.This study investigates the prevalence and consequences of PE in young adults aged 18-44 years hospitalized with sarcoidosis using data from the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020) with relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. This study aims to address the primary outcomes of the burden and trends of PE and its associated impact on in-hospital mortality. Additionally, it explores secondary outcomes such as healthcare resource utilization and discharge patterns.Among 50,385 young adults (median age 37 years) hospitalized with sarcoidosis, 1120 had PE, showing a linear increase from 2% in 2016 to 2.9% (P < 0.001) in 2020. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group, predominantly in young blacks, exhibited a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as obesity, smoking, drug use, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism and prior history of venous thrombus embolism. In contrast, the sarcoidosis-PE- group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (with/without chronic complication), hyperlipidemia and chronic pulmonary disease. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for all potential sociodemographic and comorbid variables showed higher odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.24, P < 0.02) in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group as compared to the sarcoidosis-PE- group. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group also had higher hospital costs and length of stay.The higher odds of in-hospital mortality with an increased length of stay and hospital cost observed in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group highlight the often underreported complications of sarcoidosis, particularly in a younger demographic.

However, these studies often employed Pepto-Bismol containing bismuth subsalicylate with dosages exceeding the recommended limits for human consumption, limiting their clinical applicability.The purpose of this study was to improve iodine-bismuth dual-contrast imaging on a clinical photon-counting CT (PCCT) system using a noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) approach.Four bismuth samples (0.6, 1.3, 2.5, and 5.1 mg/mL) and three iodine rods (1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg/mL) were inserted into a multi-energy CT phantom and scanned on a PCCT system at 140 kV. VMIs were generated from 40 to 190 keV in 10 keV increments. Iodine and bismuth maps were computed for all possible keV pairs using a generic image-based three-material decomposition method and compared with maps generated from the original low-/high-energy PCCT images. Mass concentrations, noise levels, and individual as well as joint root-mean-square error (RMSE) for iodine and bismuth were measured to determine the optimal keV pair. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of low concentration samples (bismuth: 0.6 and 1.3 mg/mL; iodine: 1.0 mg/mL) were calculated at the optimal keV pair and compared to the values determined with the original PCCT images. In an IRB-approved feasibility study, a research patient was administered two doses of Pepto-Bismol prior to a routine abdomen-pelvis CT scan. Material decomposition was performed using both the original low-/high-energy images and the optimal VMI pair identified in the phantom study. Bismuth signals in the stomach and proximal small bowel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.The VMI pair of 110 and 190 keV was determined to be optimal, achieving the lowest joint RMSE of 0.49 mg/mL, compared to 1.42 mg/mL for the original low-/high-energy pair. It also yielded the highest CNR, representing a 190-318% improvement over the original low/high-energy decomposition. Qualitatively, both phantom and patient studies demonstrated improved iodine-bismuth separation and reduced noise using the optimized VMI pair.These findings suggest that noise-optimized VMI selection can enhance dual-contrast material decomposition performance on clinical PCCT, supporting its potential for translation into gastrointestinal imaging applications.© 2025 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Medical physics,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Sophia Roth|Diwash Thapa|Afrouz Ataei|Vasantha Vasan|Richard W Ahn|Lifeng Yu|Yin Xi|Liqiang Ren,Lifeng Yu,"Department of Radiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Sophia Roth, Diwash Thapa, Afrouz Ataei, Vasantha Vasan, Richard W Ahn, Lifeng Yu, Yin Xi, Liqiang Ren",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474054/,"This research explores a new medical imaging technique that could improve how doctors diagnose and monitor certain gastrointestinal conditions.

In recent years, Magseed has emerged as a non-wired localization approach with promising outcomes due to its flexibility and precision. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Magseed localization on non-palpable breast lesions.Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. The pooled mean and proportions were analyzed using a random-effects model. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420250654940).From 958 studies screened, 16 studies involving 2,117 patients and 2,176 Magseeds were included. The overall rate of positive margins was 7.6% [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.04, 0.11, I2=88%], and the re-excision rate was 8.2% (95%CI=0.05, 0.12, I2=87%). The overall complication rate was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=7%). The success rate for Magseed placement was 99.3% (95%CI=0.987, 0.998, I2=1%), the migration-related failure was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=0%), and the retrieval success rate was 99.6% (95%CI=0.992, 0.999, I2=0%). The mean operative time was 61.4 min (95%CI=55.9, 66.9, I2=98%).Magseed appears to be a safe and effective technique for the preoperative localization of selected non-palpable breast lesions. Nonetheless, further studies based on breast density, size, and depth are required to investigate the feasibility of preoperative Magseed localization for patients with non-palpable breast lesions.Copyright © 2026 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

This study provides updated 2022 estimates of GI cancer incidence and mortality worldwide, along with projections of incident cases and deaths through 2050 to inform cancer control strategies.In this population-based study, data from the GLOBOCAN 2022 database were used to examine incidence and deaths associated with GI cancer. By using global demographic projections, this study estimated the projected number of incident cases and deaths until the year 2050.By 2050, the global burden of GI cancer is projected to reach 9.06 million incident cases (+85%) and 6.42 million deaths (+93%) from 2022. Increases in incidence are projected for both females (+87%) and males (+83%), as are increases in mortality for both females (+97%) and males (+91%).

41468029,2026-01-01,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Interventional Pulmonology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing interventional pulmonology (IP) by enhancing diagnostics, procedural precision, and patient outcomes. AI-powered tools improve lung nodule detection, radiomics-based risk stratification, and bronchoscopic navigation. Machine learning (ML) algorithms aid in lung cancer screening by analyzing imaging data, reducing false positives, and improving early diagnosis. AI-driven robotic-assisted bronchoscopy enhances navigation and biopsy accuracy, particularly for peripheral lung lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and cytopathology benefit from AI's ability to assess lymph node malignancy and optimize rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). AI applications extend to phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and identifying candidates for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR). Deep learning (DL) models analyze computed tomography (CT) imaging and spirometry data to optimize patient selection. AI-driven algorithms are also advancing pleural effusion detection, differentiation, and classification, supporting clinical decision-making. Education and research in IP are also transforming with AI-driven simulation, virtual reality, and automated assessment tools that enhance procedural training and competency evaluation. The integration of AI into clinical work and procedural training accelerates advancements while presenting challenges in ethical AI implementation, data security, and bias mitigation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in IP will expand, improving procedural efficiency, personalizing treatment plans, and optimizing patient selection for interventions. Future developments will focus on refining AI-driven predictive analytics, enhancing robotic-assisted procedures, and integrating AI seamlessly into clinical workflows. The responsible implementation of AI in IP holds the potential to transform patient care, reduce complications, and advance precision medicine.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

MGUS is a common precursor to multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, so understanding it better can help doctors identify and monitor patients at risk. The researchers reviewed existing scientific literature on MGUS to clarify its characteristics and implications for patient health. They found that MGUS is a relatively common condition, affecting around 3% of adults over age 50. While MGUS itself is not cancer, it indicates the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood that can potentially develop into multiple myeloma over time. The researchers emphasize that regular monitoring is crucial for MGUS patients, as a small percentage will go on to develop myeloma or related disorders. However, the majority of MGUS patients will not progress to cancer. This research helps healthcare providers better understand the nuances of MGUS, allowing them to provide appropriate care and reassurance to patients. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the review, which relies on previously published data.

41462575,2026-01-01,Senolytic-Resistant Senescent Cells Have a Distinct SASP Profile and Functional Impact: The Path to Developing Senosensitizers.,"The senescent cell (SC) fate is linked to aging, multiple disorders and diseases, and physical dysfunction. Senolytics, agents that selectively eliminate 30%-70% of SCs, act by transiently disabling the senescent cell antiapoptotic pathways (SCAPs), which defend those SCs that are proapoptotic and pro-inflammatory from their own senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consistent with this, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, which attenuates the pro-inflammatory SASP of senescent human preadipocytes, caused them to become ""senolytic-resistant"". Administering senolytics to obese mice selectively decreased the abundance of the subset of SCs that is pro-inflammatory. In cell cultures, the 30%-70% of human senescent preadipocytes or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that are senolytic-resistant (to Dasatinib or Quercetin, respectively) had increased p16INK4a, p21CIP1, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβgal), γH2AX, and proliferative arrest similarly to the total SC population (comprising senolytic-sensitive plus-resistant SCs). However, the SASP of senolytic-resistant SCs entailed less pro-inflammatory/apoptotic factor production, induced less inflammation in non-senescent cells, and was equivalent or richer in growth/fibrotic factors. Senolytic-resistant SCs released less mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and more highly expressed the anti-inflammatory immune evasion signal, glycoprotein non-melanoma-B (GPNMB). Transplanting senolytic-resistant SCs intraperitoneally into younger mice caused less physical dysfunction than transplanting the total SC population. Because Ruxolitinib attenuates SC release of proapoptotic SASP factors, while pathogen-associated molecular pattern factors (PAMPs) can amplify the release of these factors rapidly (acting as ""senosensitizers""), senolytic-resistant and senolytic-sensitive SCs appear to be interconvertible.© 2025 The Author(s).

Senescent cells, which stop dividing as we get older, are believed to play a role in this. These cells secrete inflammatory molecules that can damage surrounding tissues. Researchers in this study investigated a group of senescent cells that are resistant to ""senolytics"" - drugs that selectively kill senescent cells. 

The researchers found that these senolytic-resistant senescent cells have a distinct secretion profile, producing fewer inflammatory factors but more growth-promoting molecules. When transplanted into younger mice, these cells caused less physical dysfunction compared to the overall senescent cell population. This suggests that senolytic-resistant cells may have a different, potentially beneficial impact on the body. 

The findings also indicate that senolytic-resistant and senolytic-sensitive cells can interconvert, meaning they can change between these two states.

This pilot study aimed to evaluate the association between on boarding elements focused on training and clinicians perceptions of delivery of care.Cross-sectional survey study.Critical Care professionals at four U.S. hospitals, professional meetings and Society of Critical Care Medicine's International Membership base. Participants were active clinicians who practice in the TCC setting.None.A total of 432 participants responded to the survey, 227 met the eligibility criteria (52.5%) and were included in the analysis. Respondents were a multi-professional group of TCC clinicians aged between 35-55 years of age (56.4%). Seventy-four percent of respondents reported having orientation before providing TCC, 46% reported having formal mentorship, and 66% reported formal training on their institutional platform. Provision of orientation before participating in a TCC program was associated with higher ratings of feeling prepared (odds ratio [OR], 3.52; p < 0.001) and feeling accepted as part of the ICU team (OR, 2.21; p = 0.008). Mentorship was associated with feeling more prepared (OR, 8.2; p < 0.001) and higher comfort in delivering care (OR, 2.78; p = 0.016). Platform training was associated with feeling more prepared (OR, 4.66; p < 0.001), comfortable in delivering care (OR, 3.6; p = 0.002), feeling accepted as part of the team (OR, 3.18; p < 0.001), and more likely to participate in quality improvement (OR, 2.51; p = 0.001).

The key findings were that clinicians who received structured training, such as an orientation before starting TCC, formal mentorship, and training on the specific technology platform, reported feeling more prepared, comfortable, and accepted as part of the care team. They were also more likely to participate in quality improvement initiatives. Additionally, clinicians who had the opportunity to visit the intensive care units (ICUs) they would be supporting remotely felt even more positive about their ability to deliver effective care. 

These results suggest that providing comprehensive training and support for TCC clinicians is important for ensuring they feel equipped to provide high-quality remote care.

They enrolled over 500 patients and randomly assigned them to receive either the new combination treatment or the standard approach.

The results showed that the neoadjuvant therapy significantly improved the chances of patients' tumors being successfully removed by surgery. It also led to longer overall survival times. These findings suggest that giving chemotherapy and radiation before surgery may be a more effective way to treat pancreatic cancer, especially for patients with borderline resectable tumors.

MASLD is a serious disease that causes fat buildup in the liver, leading to inflammation and damage. Unfortunately, MASLD can be difficult to detect early on, which is crucial for effective treatment. 

The researchers used PDFF, a non-invasive imaging method, to measure fat levels in the livers of patients suspected of having MASLD. They compared the PDFF results to other diagnostic tests to see how well it could identify the disease. The study found that PDFF was highly accurate at detecting MASLD, even in its early stages, outperforming traditional approaches.

These findings suggest PDFF could be a valuable tool for diagnosing MASLD more reliably. This is important because early diagnosis allows doctors to intervene and manage the disease before it causes irreversible liver damage.

We investigated oncological outcomes in patients with breast cancer and residual micrometastases in the sentinel lymph nodes treated with or without ALND.OPBC-07/microNAC was a retrospective cohort study, using data obtained from the institutional databases of 84 cancer centres in 30 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with clinical T1-4, N0-3 breast cancer at diagnosis treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2023, who were found to have residual micrometastases (metastasis measuring >0·2 mm or >200 cells, not exceeding 2·0 mm in size) on frozen section or on final paraffin sections as determined by sentinel lymph node biopsy, targeted axillary dissection (sentinel lymph node biopsy with single or dual-tracer mapping plus image-guided localisation of the initially biopsy-proven and clipped node), or the marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI) procedure were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint was the 5-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) stratified by type of axillary surgery. Given the median follow-up, here we report 3-year rates and exploratory 5-year estimates. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06529302.1585 female patients with ypN1mi disease were analysed, of whom 804 (50·7%) underwent ALND and 781 (49·3%) did not. Of 1585 women, 238 (15·0%) self-identified as Asian, 65 (4·1%) as Black, 200 (12·6%) as Hispanic, 968 (61·1%) as White, and 114 (7·2%) as unknown race and ethnicity. 925 (58·4%) of 1585 women had cT2 tumours, 1054 (66·5%) were node positive, and 1267 (79·9%) received nodal radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 3·1 years (IQR 1·8-5·2). The 3-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) for the entire cohort was 2·0% (95% CI 1·3-2·9), with no statistical difference identified by extent of axillary surgery. However, patients with triple-negative disease who did not receive ALND had significantly higher rates of any axillary recurrence than women treated with ALND (8·7% [95% CI 4·4-15·0] vs 2·4% [95% CI 0·7-6·5], p=0·018). On multivariable analysis, triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio 3·83 [95% CI 1·72-8·52]) and omission of nodal radiotherapy (2·62 [1·19-5·73]) but not omission of ALND (0·86 [0·37-2·00]) were independently associated with an increased risk of any axillary recurrence.Overall, these results do not support ALND for all patients with ypN1mi on sentinel lymph node biopsy treated with nodal radiotherapy; however, tumour biology should be taken into account when considering ALND omission.US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

However, patients with triple-negative breast cancer who skipped the ALND had higher rates of lymph node recurrence. The study suggests that for many patients, the ALND may not be necessary if they receive radiation therapy to the lymph nodes. But for those with more aggressive triple-negative tumors, the ALND may still be beneficial. These findings could help guide"

We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed.Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide.Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.MSD.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Limited data exist on the inpatient outcomes of septic arthritis of the wrist among patients treated using arthroscopy versus open arthrotomy. The purpose of our study was to compare the reoperation rates and inpatient complications between these two procedures.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients 18 years old and older with a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the wrist in the United States from 2002 to 2012. Septic arthritis cases were classified based on the treatment modality, and patients who were treated either arthroscopically or using arthrotomy were included in statistical analysis. Hospitalization outcomes, including reoperation rates and surgical and medical complications were compared after adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Mean costs and length of stay were compared using the Student's t- test.A total of 1,065 patients with septic arthritis of the wrist were treated either arthroscopically (n = 516) or by open arthrotomy (n = 549). Patients who were treated arthroscopically had higher reoperation rates (48.6% vs 8.7%). Using multivariate analysis, patients who were treated arthroscopically were more likely to undergo repeat arthroscopic procedures (odds radio [OR], 10.4; 95% CI,7.0-15.3), although they were not different in terms of the risk of development of medical (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.80-1.80) or surgical (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.16) complications. Arthroscopy and arthrotomy also did not differ in terms of length of stay (6.29 ± 5.0 vs 6.26 ± 4.5) and inpatient hospital charges (33,563.4 ± 30,296.3 vs 34,422.6 ± 31,362.0).Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of the increased rate of reoperation when managing patients with septic arthritis of the wrist arthroscopically and should discuss this potential risk with surgical candidates.Prognostic III.© 2025 The Authors.",Journal of hand surgery global online,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Gabriel Hanna|Robert Dalcortivo|Michael Vosbikian|Irfan H Ahmed|Michael M Abdou|Eli Bryk|Robert Pae,Michael M Abdou,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brookdale University Hospital, Brooklyn, NY.|Department of Orthopedics, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.","Gabriel Hanna, Robert Dalcortivo, Michael Vosbikian, Irfan H Ahmed, Michael M Abdou, Eli Bryk, Robert Pae",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41439256/,"Septic arthritis, or joint infection, is a serious condition that can lead to significant health problems if not properly treated.

By closely examining this patient's symptoms and medical history, the researchers aimed to determine the underlying cause and provide guidance for healthcare providers on how to properly manage such cases. 

The key finding was that the patient's symptoms were due to a rare condition called uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM), where abnormal blood vessels in the uterus cause excessive bleeding. This was likely exacerbated by the IUD placement. For patients, this research highlights the importance of closely monitoring for complications after IUD insertion and promptly reporting any concerning symptoms to their doctor.

41429670,2026-01-01,Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe autoimmune disease that predominantly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord, which is a distinct disease process from multiple sclerosis (MS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic manifestation of NMOSD is atypical optic neuritis (ON), characterized by severe vision loss with a higher propensity toward bilateral involvement, longitudinal enhancement of the optic nerve, and chiasmal involvement than MS-related optic neuritis. Due to the severity of disease, high recurrence rate, and significant risk of permanent deficits, early recognition of neuro-ophthalmologic signs and short- and long-term management with immunosuppressive therapies is critical.

It often requires repeated treatment with silver nitrate using a speculum to access the neovagina. This study evaluates whether adding betamethasone suppositories to silver nitrate treatment improves the resolution of hypergranulation tissue after PIV.A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who received supplemental betamethasone suppositories in addition to silver nitrate treatment (betamethasone group) between 01/2023 and 12/2024 and matched to a cohort of patients treated with silver nitrate alone (silver nitrate group). Outcomes, number of treatments, and severity of hypergranulation tissue were compared using t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.There were 16 patients in each group, with similar average follow-up times: 8.5 ± 5.5 months (silver nitrate group) and 7.8 ± 4.7 months (betamethasone group) (P = 0.70). At the most recent follow-up, moderate and severe hypergranulation resolved more often in the betamethasone group (86%, 50%) than in the silver nitrate group (60%, 25%). Patients in the betamethasone group with moderate or severe hypergranulation tissue required fewer median treatments for resolution (2 vs 3.5 and 4 vs 5, respectively). After excluding cases that required cauterization under anesthesia, patients in the betamethasone group were significantly more likely to have resolution of their hypergranulation tissue compared to patients in the silver nitrate group (P = 0.035).Betamethasone is an effective addition to silver nitrate for the treatment of hypergranulation tissue, with our results indicating it can improve resolution and lessen treatment burden in patients' post-PIV.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A common complication of this surgery is the development of excess granulation tissue, called hypergranulation, which can be difficult to treat. This study examined whether adding a steroid medication called betamethasone to the standard silver nitrate treatment could improve the resolution of this complication.

The researchers reviewed medical records of patients who received either silver nitrate alone or silver nitrate plus betamethasone suppositories to treat hypergranulation after vaginoplasty. They found that the betamethasone group had better outcomes - more patients saw their moderate to severe hypergranulation fully resolve, and they required fewer treatment sessions on average. The betamethasone group was also more likely to have their hypergranulation clear up without needing additional procedures under anesthesia. 

These results suggest that the addition of betamethasone can be an effective way to enhance the standard silver nitrate treatment for this common post-surgical complication. This could lead to better outcomes and reduced treatment burden for transgender women recovering from vaginoplasty. However, the study was relatively small"

However, the clinical implication of concurrent -5/5q and TP53 aberrations in MN with ≥5% blasts is poorly understood.Patients with TP53-mutated MN carrying ≥5% blasts assessing the prognostic impact of -5/5q on 24-month overall survival (OS24) were examined.Of 587 patients, 515 (88%) exhibited -5/5q overwhelmingly in the context of a complex karyotype (98.3% vs. 61.1% complex karyotype without -5/5q; p < .0001) and multihit TP53 allelic state (88.3% vs. 56.9%; p < .0001). Proportions of patients with blasts ≥20% were comparable between groups with and without -5/5q; p = 0.26. Notably, patients with -5/5q exhibited significantly fewer coalterations; p < .0001. Looking at outcomes, presence of -5/5q was associated with shorter median 24-month overall survival (7.8 months vs. 11.2 months; pLog-rank = .012), an effect restricted to subgroups with blasts <20% (p = .039; N = 163), absent -7/7q (p = .007; N = 225), or WHO5-defined single hit allelic state (p = 0.030; N = 91). Importantly, -5/5q retained independent adverse prognostic significance regardless of TP53 allelic state in a multivariable model. Furthermore, among the subset of 75 (13%) patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, -5/5q predicted significantly shorter median 5-year posttransplant survival (16.2 months vs. median not reached; pLog-rank = .009).These findings emphasize the independent prognostic relevance of chromosome 5/5q losses underscoring the clinical relevance of cytogenetic testing for -5/5q even in this high-risk cohort.© 2025 The Author(s).

They found that this dual-contrast approach can provide more detailed information about the liver's structure and function, potentially leading to earlier detection of liver problems and better monitoring of treatment. This is particularly important for conditions like liver cancer, where early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. While more research is needed, the use of dual contrast agents represents a promising advancement in MRI technology that could ultimately benefit patients by enabling more accurate and informative liver scans."
41275871,2026-01-01,"Artificial intelligence and radiologists in pancreatic cancer detection using standard of care CT scans (PANORAMA): an international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory, observational study.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among major cancer types, primarily due to late diagnosis on contrast-enhanced CT. Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve diagnostic performance, but robust benchmarks and reliable comparison to radiologists' performance are scarce. We established an open-source benchmark with the aim of investigating AI systems for PDAC detection on CT and compared them to radiologists' performance, at scale.In this international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory, observational study (PANORAMA), the AI system was trained and externally validated within an international benchmark, with a cohort of 2310 patients from four tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the USA for training (n=2224) and tuning (n=86), and a sequestered cohort of 1130 patients from five tertiary care centres (the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway) for testing. A multi-reader, multi-case observer study with 68 radiologists (40 centres, 12 countries; median 9·0 [IQR 6·0-14·5] years of experience) was conducted on a subset of 391 patients from the testing cohort. The reference standard was established with histopathology and at least 3 years of clinical follow-up. The primary endpoint was the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system compared to that of radiologists at PDAC detection on CT. The study protocol and statistical plan were prespecified to test non-inferiority (considering a margin of 0·05), followed by superiority towards the AI system. This study is registered with Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10599559) and is complete.Of the 3440 (1511 [44%] female, 1929 [56%] male; median age 67 [IQR 58-74] years) included patients (Jan 1, 2004 to Dec 31, 2023), 1103 (32%) received a positive PDAC diagnosis. In the sequestered testing cohort of 1130 patients (406 with histologically confirmed PDAC), AI achieved an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·90-0·93). In the subset of 391 patients (144 [37%] with histologically confirmed PDAC) used for the reader study, AI achieved statistically non-inferior (p<0·0001) and superior (p=0·001) performance with an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·89-0·94), compared to the pool of 68 participating radiologists, with an AUROC of 0·88 (0·85-0·91).AI demonstrated substantially improved PDAC detection on routine CT scans compared to radiologists on average, showing potential to detect cancer earlier and improve patient outcomes.European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41321428,2026-01-01,Clinical Insights Into the Mechanistic Crossroads of Lamotrigine and Therapeutic Ketosis in Bipolar Depression.,"There are substantial care gaps in optimizing treatment response for bipolar depression given, at best, a modicum of benefit from antidepressant treatment and, in contrast, a substantial cardiometabolic burden associated with regulatory-approved antipsychotic treatment. Lamotrigine (LGT) is an anticonvulsant with an evidence base in both epilepsy and bipolar disorder (BD), in particular bipolar depression ""stabilizing from down under."" There is a well-established bidirectional relationship between BD and epilepsy. Recognizing the complex interplay between mood, diet, and energy metabolism, lifestyle interventions have emerged as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in BD. Among these, therapeutic ketosis, with century-old evidence base in epilepsy, has regained new interest as a promising adjunctive treatment for mood and metabolic comorbidities. LGT and therapeutic ketosis both target neurobiological pathways that regulate energy metabolism and promote neuronal stability-key processes implicated in mood regulation and neuronal protection. This alignment suggests the possibility of synergistic effects in BD. In this review, we explore the overlapping mechanisms of LGT and therapeutic ketosis and provide clinical insights into their combined use in BD, offering a comprehensive perspective on this innovative treatment strategy.© 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological psychiatry global open science,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Dina N Ali|Iain H Campbell|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,Dina N Ali|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,"Department of Psychiatry & Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Department of Pharmacy Services, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Dina N Ali, Iain H Campbell, Jonathan G Leung, Tamahara Gonzalez Campos, Duan Liu, Mete Ercis, Matej Markota, Deniz Ceylan, Kyla Lara-Breitinger, Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, Adam S Anderson, Aysegul Ozerdem, Stacey J Winham, Mark A Frye",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41321428/,"Bipolar disorder is a challenging mental health condition that can significantly impact a person's mood, energy, and daily functioning. Current treatments, while helpful, often have side effects and don't work well for everyone. This research explores two promising approaches that may work better together: the medication lamotrigine and a dietary intervention called therapeutic ketosis. 

The researchers reviewed the scientific literature to understand how these two treatments might complement each other in treating bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug that has shown benefits for bipolar disorder, particularly in stabilizing mood. Therapeutic ketosis, a metabolic state achieved through a specialized diet, has long been used to treat epilepsy and is now being studied for its potential mental health benefits. The researchers found that both lamotrigine and therapeutic ketosis target similar biological pathways related to energy metabolism and neuronal stability - processes that are crucial for mood regulation. This suggests the two approaches may have a synergistic effect when used together, potentially offering more effective treatment for bipolar depression with fewer side effects.

A distinct intermuscular fascial border aids in delineating the separation between the brachioradialis (BR) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) muscles. However, this border may be absent, making correct needle placement complex and assessment more difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe the presence and absence of this fascial border in healthy individuals to help with accurate EMG needle placement.Twenty healthy patients underwent sonographic examination by a single sonographer physician of the ECRL and BR to identify the presence or absence of the intermuscular fascial border.The fascial border that routinely separates the ECRL and BR was absent in at least one arm in 20% of subjects (12.5% of upper limbs). One subject had an absent fascial border in both upper limbs.US can assess for the presence or absence of intermuscular fascial borders. This assessment is important for accurate EMG needle placement and localization.

41128719,2026-01-01,Impaired Perfusion and Early Ischemic Stroke Recurrence in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis: BIORISK ICAS Study.,"Intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) is associated with an increased risk of early recurrent ischemic stroke. We evaluated whether biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion-specifically, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch volume-were associated with recurrent ischemic stroke within 90 days.The BIORISK ICAS (Biomarkers and Recurrence Risk in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis) is a multicenter retrospective international study (35 sites) that included hospitalized patients with symptomatic ICAS (50%-99% luminal stenosis of the intracranial vertebral, basilar, distal internal carotid, or proximal middle cerebral artery) from January 2019 to June 2024. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery within 90 days. In the primary analysis, the exposure was an acute anterior circulation borderzone infarct. In secondary analysis of the subset with presentation within 72 hours of last known normal and perfusion imaging completed, the exposure of interest was prespecified as hypoperfusion mismatch volume at Tmax (time to maximum) threshold of 6 seconds, dichotomized at the Youden index. We performed multivariable Cox regression to test associations between exposure variables and the outcome, adjusting for clinically relevant variables and those associated with the outcome (P<0.1).Of 2050 patients with symptomatic ICAS, 1737 (84.7%) presented within 72 hours of symptom onset, among whom 509 (29.3%) underwent perfusion imaging. The primary analysis included 1891 patients; 174 (9.2%) patients had recurrent ischemic stroke in the symptomatic arterial territory. In adjusted Cox regression models, there was an association between anterior circulation borderzone infarct and recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.02-1.93]). In the perfusion imaging analysis, hypoperfusion mismatch of ≥10 mL was associated with recurrent ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.03-3.28]).Biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch were associated with increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. These findings support the use of perfusion imaging in ICAS as well as future trials investigating early reperfusion in high-risk patients with ICAS.",Stroke,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Shadi Yaghi|Farhan Khan|Skylar Lewis|Ava Stipanovich|Richard Choi|Richard Baker|Sami Al Kasab|Ahmad Abu Qdais|Sridhara S Yaddanapudi|Sabiha Sultana|Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik|James Klaas|Ekaterina Bakradze|Muhammad Aemaz Ur Rehman|Christopher Leon Guerrero|Hadley W Ressler|Faddi G Saleh Velez|Cameron Owens|Camila B Pinto|Margy McCullough-Hicks|Dawson Cooper|Abhiram Parameswaran Pillai|Praveen Hariharan|Shaista Alam|Morgan Mayer|Mirjam R Heldner|Irina Kugler|Kateryna Antonenko|William Almiri|Sheila Martins|Thais L Secchi|Gabriel Mantovani|Aaron Rothstein|Kelly Sloane|Balaji Krishnaiah|Linda Alfred|Cheran Elangovan|Venugopalan Y Vishnu|Meena Chandu|Ayush Agarwal|Michele Romoli|Nicola Marrone|Stefano Vozzi|Malik Ghannam|Mohamed Elshikh|Mahmoud Dibas|Yan Hou|Krithika Peshwe|Ajay Tunguturi|João P Marto|Rui Duarte Armindo|Jennifer Frontera|Lindsey Kuohn|Mohammad AlMajali|Osama O Zaidat|Benan Barakat|Niha Khan|Alexis N Simpkins|Shayak Sen|Mariana Coelho|Joao Sargento Fritas|Joao A Sousa|Diana Aguiar de Sousa|Mafalda Soares|Amanda Cyntia Lima Fonseca Rodrigues|Aditya Jhaveri|Rami Z Morsi|James Siegler|Yasmin N Aziz|Pablo Harker|Sonia Bhati|Sophia Vassilopoulou|Argyro Tountopoulou|Adam de Havenon|Varsha Muddasani|Nils Henninger|Hieu Tran|Johanna Helenius|Mohammad Khasawneh|Ananth Vellimana|Ryan Apfel|Amir Molaie|Marina Mannino|Valeria Terruso|Tarek El Halabi|Mahasen Reda|Christel Tamer|Piers Klein|Liqi Shu|Pooja Khatri|Karen Furie|Thanh N Nguyen|David S Liebeskind|Shyam Prabhakaran,Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik,"Department of Neurology, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI (S.Y., F.K., S.L., A.S., L.S., K.F.).|Department of Neurology, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ (S.Y.).|Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA (S.A., M.

The researchers conducted a study to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent low ligation versus high ligation. They found that the low ligation technique resulted in similar cancer removal rates but with fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and better long-term quality of life for patients.

The study focused on the 3 currently US Food and Drug Administration-cleared AI systems: LumineticsCore, EyeArt, and AEYE Diagnostic Screening (AEYE-DS), assessing their performance and strategies utilized by health systems to effectively implement this technology in clinics.Diagnostic accuracy data, ophthalmologist feedback.The literature review found 6 publications reporting diagnostic accuracy data of autonomous AI DR testing in primary care office settings, including 5 for LumineticsCore and 1 for EyeArt. Additional articles, of which 18 were selected for detailed review, addressed impact on patient adherence, health equity, and carbon footprint, as well as cost-effectiveness and workflow efficiency analyses. There were no studies comparing the systems on the same patients. In aggregate, adopters of the AI systems reported average nonmydriatic gradability of 49% to 75% (n = 5), sensitivity 87% to 100% (n = 3), and specificity 60% to 91% (n = 4). Based on public records at the time of writing, both LumineticsCore and EyeArt have >5 academic adopters in the United States. Limited information is available on AEYE-DS given recency of regulatory clearance. Elements of successful implementation include proper site selection, aligning AI tools with primary care clinic workflows, streamlining patient engagement and referrals, and ongoing training of staff. Health systems utilizing AI reported improved Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures, health equity, productivity, and patient adherence to follow-up with ophthalmology.Artificial intelligence-aided diabetic eye examinations present a promising solution to facilitate early detection of DR, promote equitable access, and drive down system-level cost of care. Its successful implementation requires addressing technological, operational, and stakeholder engagement challenges. Our study underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize care delivery provided its adoption is strategically managed.The author has no/the authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.© 2025 by the American Academy of Ophthalmologyé.",Ophthalmology science,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Clare W Teng|Saawan D Patel|Andrew J Barkmeier|T YA Liu|David Myung|Jeffrey Henderer|James Liu|Eric Hansen|Lama A Al-Aswad,Andrew J Barkmeier,"Department of Ophthalmology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.|Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.|Department of Ophthalmology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|John A.

Researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can help detect this condition early, but getting these technologies adopted in healthcare has been challenging. This study looked at the performance and real-world implementation of three FDA-approved AI systems for diabetic retinopathy screening. The researchers reviewed published studies on the accuracy of these AI tools and interviewed doctors leading their adoption at several major medical centers. They found that the AI systems were able to accurately identify signs of diabetic retinopathy around 87-100% of the time, with good overall performance. However, the systems also had limitations, such as only being able to get usable images about half the time without dilation of the patient's eyes. Successful implementation required careful planning to integrate the AI tools into clinic workflows, engage patients, and train staff. Health systems that adopted these AI technologies reported benefits like improved screening rates, better equity in access to care, and increased efficiency. Overall, this research suggests that AI-powered diabetic eye exams have great potential to improve early detection and management of this condition, but healthcare providers need to thoughtfully address"

When a person suffers significant bone loss, such as from a traumatic injury or cancer treatment, traditional bone grafts may not be enough to fully heal the damage. Vascularized grafts, which include the patient's own living bone tissue along with its blood supply, can be more effective in these challenging cases. This review article examines how vascularized bone grafts are used to treat various types of bone defects in the extremities, from the hands and feet up to the shoulders and hips. The researchers explain that these specialized grafts can be transferred as free flaps or attached to the existing blood vessels, and they can even include cartilage or growth plates. Vascularized grafts are particularly helpful when the surrounding tissue has poor blood flow, such as from radiation treatment or infection. While these complex procedures require skilled surgical teams, they can significantly improve outcomes for patients with severe bone loss, helping them regain function and quality of life. However, the authors note that vascularized grafts do carry higher risks than simpler bone graft options,"

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cytokine dysregulation and microglial dysfunction in adolescents with MDD (regardless of disease onset or duration) during the course of the disorder.This study included 60 adolescent patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls (HCs). Peripheral blood levels of nine target cytokines-including interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-were measured using ultrasensitive multiplex electrochemiluminescence assays. To better understand the potential changes in microglial cells of adolescents with MDD, the human microglial cell line HMC3 was treated with 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), a key neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway (KP), and the effects of 3-HK on microglial cells were subsequently evaluated.After multiple test correction using the Holm method, compared with the HCs, adolescents with MDD exhibited a significant increase in the level of the peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α. Moreover, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-18 showed an upward trend, while the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ showed a downward trend, yet none of these trends reached statistical significance. In addition, G-CSF levels were significantly decreased, while M-CSF levels were significantly increased. In vitro experiments, 3-HK significantly reduced the viability of human microglial cells. Further experiments demonstrated that 3-HK induced microglial pyroptosis in a concentration-dependent manner via the mitochondrial pathway, leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.Dysregulation of cytokines may lead to excessive activation of microglia, resulting in increased release of the neurotoxic KP metabolite 3-HK. This suppresses microglial proliferation and induces microglial cell death, including pyroptosis, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental health condition that often begins during the teenage years, but its underlying causes are not well understood. The researchers looked at levels of different immune system signaling molecules called cytokines in the blood of adolescents with MDD, and also studied how a specific neurotoxic compound affects the function of microglial cells, which are the immune cells of the brain.

The study found that adolescents with MDD had higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α compared to healthy individuals. There were also trends towards increased levels of other inflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, though these did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, levels of the growth factor M-CSF were elevated while G-CSF was reduced in MDD patients. In lab experiments, the neurotoxic compound 3-HK was shown to impair the viability of microglial cells and induce a type of cell death called pyroptosis, leading to the release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.

Accurate monitoring of physical activity is essential to understand its impact on health outcomes in older adults. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hip-worn and ankle-worn accelerometers in capturing physical activities in older adults, comparing their performance to self-reported activity across weekdays and weekends.Forty healthy participants aged 51-82 years completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on both their right hip and ankle for four consecutive days, covering two weekdays and two weekends. Data from the accelerometers were analyzed to compare step counts and the ability to detect sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activities between the two sensor placements.The ankle-worn accelerometer recorded higher step counts and more light physical activities. In contrast, the hip-worn accelerometer detected more moderate to vigorous physical activities. Self-reported physical activity was well correlated with step counts and sedentary/light activities on weekdays, but failed to reflect moderate to vigorous activity and all activities on weekends.Ankle-worn accelerometers are more effective in estimating light activities, which dominate the daily activity patterns of older adults. Hip-worn accelerometers better capture intensive activities. Self-reports demonstrated limited reliability in assessing physical activity on weekends. These findings enhance the understanding of physical activity patterns in older adults and inform interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging, especially regarding activity monitoring and the choice of accelerometer placement.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41134013,2026-01-01,Parameters Associated With Renal Recovery and Survival in Myeloma Patients With Acute Renal Failure to Cast Nephropathy.,"Acute renal failure due to cast nephropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we aimed to identify parameters associated with renal outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM patients with CAN-related acute renal failure and to validate the IMWG criteria for renal response. CAN diagnosis was based on biopsy or clinical assessment. Of 787 registered patients, 354 met the inclusion criteria, requiring at least two therapy cycles with documented chemotherapy response, renal response, and eGFR. Baseline free light chain (FLC) levels (median 6825.65 mg/L) decreased below 500 mg/L in 67.8% of patients. According to IMWG classification, renal complete response, partial response, and minimal response were achieved in 33.9%, 19.5%, and 28.0% of patients, respectively. The best eGFR values > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 33.9% of patients, while 33.3%, 22.3%, and 10.5% had best eGFR values of 30-59, 15-29, and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Renal response correlated with baseline FLC levels, IgG kappa, eGFR, and ECOG status in multivariate analysis, as well as with myeloma response and FLC reduction in univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 77.6 months. Survival correlated with age, myeloma response, ECOG status, FLC kappa type, baseline eGFR, standard-risk cytogenetics, and calcium levels, among other factors. A comparison of IMWG renal response criteria with classification based solely on best eGFR showed similar utility. Of 136 patients requiring dialysis, 80 (58.8%) were able to discontinue dialysis during therapy. Bortezomib containing myeloma therapy, along with significant FLC reduction, was associated with favorable outcome.© 2025 The Author(s).

41176274,2026-01-01,A Targeted LC-MS/MS-Based Quantitative Assay for Detecting Plasma Factor XIII A/B Subunit Deficiency.,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a heterotetramer that plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade, facilitating fibrin crosslinking to stabilize clots. Congenital or acquired deficiency of the FXIII A or B subunits can lead to prolonged bleeding. Existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based and latex agglutination assays for measuring FXIII are limited to detecting only the FXIIIA subunit of the complex. In this study, a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed and validated to accurately quantify both FXIIIA and FXIIIB subunits in plasma. Peptides measured by this targeted assay were rigorously selected based on analytical robustness, with the method demonstrating excellent sensitivity (limit of detection, 1.56 to 3.67 mU/mL), linearity (r2 > 0.998), and precision (CV, <10%). Comparison with the conventional assay based on ammonia release demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.983) and agreement (Cohen κ = 0.846) for FXIIIA. On analysis of 98 clinical plasma samples, the assay accurately identified cases with FXIII deficiency based on significantly reduced FXIIIA with varying alterations in FXIIIB levels. These results establish the clinical utility of the LC-MS/MS assay, highlight its potential for improving diagnostic accuracy for FXIII deficiency, and lay the foundation for future research on FXIII dynamics in pathologic states.Copyright © 2026 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Quantitative assessments of the progression of cardiac metastatic size (maximal diameter) and metabolic activity, as measured by maximal standardized uptake value (SUV max ), were performed on serial 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET imaging. In a cohort of 23 patients, 11 patients (47.8%) received Lu-177 DOTATATE therapy. Through a median of 2.2 years of follow-up, these patients showed some reduction in metastatic burden with a median reduction in maximal diameter of 1.0 mm (IQR: 0.0-3.0) and a median change in SUV max of -1.6 (IQR: -4.4 to 1.5). In contrast, patients who did not receive Lu-177 DOTATATE had some increase in maximal diameter of 0.5 mm (-2.0 to 2.0) and an increase in SUV max of 1.4 (-6.2 to 2.3).

In this case report, researchers describe an exceptionally rare case of a giant cell tumor that originated in the frontal bone of a 9-year-old boy, with extension into the orbit and brain. The young patient presented with a progressively enlarging swelling of the left eye and vision loss. Imaging tests revealed a destructive mass with an unusual intracranial component that was compressing the adjacent brain tissue. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a giant cell tumor. The researchers note that these tumors rarely occur in the skull, especially in children, making this case quite unusual. The patient was treated with a combination of pre-surgical therapy and surgical removal of the entire tumor, which resulted in complete elimination of the cancer with no recurrence after one year of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering giant cell tumors in the differential diagnosis for children with destructive masses involving the skull and orbit, even though these are extremely rare in this age group.

41127144,2026-01-01,Multidisciplinary Assessment and Management of Functional Dysphagia.,"Functional dysphagia (FD), a type of functional esophageal disorder, is characterized by difficulty passing solid and/or liquid food through the esophagus, without underlying mucosal, luminal, or major motility diseases, as defined by the Rome IV criteria. It is also a type of functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), which are disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). The underlying mechanism is thought to involve a complex interaction between the gut and central nervous system (CNS), where altered gut signaling may lead to visceral hypersensitivity, while CNS dysregulation may cause hyper-vigilance, potentially contributing to motor disturbances. There is no standardized approach to the evaluation of FD and historically, it has been considered a diagnosis of exclusion. There is also no standardized treatment algorithm, and most FD treatments are garnered from other FGIDs. As our field gains a deeper appreciation of FGIDs, it is also clear that the management of suspected FD patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. This narrative review not only 1) provides an overview of FD including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, associated disorders, multidisciplinary assessment, and treatment, but also 2) details our unique multidisciplinary approach to FD patients from the perspective of gastroenterologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and GI psychologists at the Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders at the University of South Florida (USF CSD).",Gastro hep advances,2026,2026,,,Jaimie Anderson|Wojciech Blonski|Joy Gaziano|Camille Thélin|Rebecca Klam|Samuel Slone|Rene L Utianski|John Jacobs,Rene L Utianski,"Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, Speech Language Pathology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Division of Gastroenterology, James A Haley Veterans Affairs, Hospital, Tampa, Florida.|Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Neurogastroenterology and Motility Center, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Jaimie Anderson, Wojciech Blonski, Joy Gaziano, Camille Thélin, Rebecca Klam, Samuel Slone, Rene L Utianski, John Jacobs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127144/,"Functional dysphagia is a condition where people have difficulty swallowing food or liquids, even though there is no obvious physical cause like a blockage or muscle problem.

41117176,2026-01-01,What Is Clinical Anatomy?-A Consensus Statement From the American Association of Clinical Anatomists.,"At the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA) in Bellevue, Washington, June 2025, two inaugural events-the Clinical Anatomy Fireside Chat (CAFC) and the Clinical Anatomy Symposium: Head and Neck 2025 (CAS)-fostered rich dialogue on the evolving role and operational definition of clinical anatomy. Experts from various clinical and anatomical disciplines explored the meaning of clinical anatomy, highlighting the absence of a universal definition despite its frequent use in education and research. Through these interdisciplinary discussions, a consensus emerged: clinical anatomy is not defined solely by the possession of clinical credentials but by the integration of anatomical knowledge and clinical relevance, achieved most effectively through collaboration. Clinical anatomy education and research require different depths of clinical knowledge depending on the audience and objective, and meaningful collaboration can bridge gaps in expertise. The symposium further illustrated that high-quality clinical anatomy emerges from mutual respect and reciprocal insight between clinicians and anatomists. This article presents a consensus statement developed by AACA representatives and invited speakers, affirming that collaboration is not only foundational to the practice of clinical anatomy but also fundamental to its definition. These conclusions aim to guide future educational models, research strategies, and interdisciplinary partnerships in the field of clinical anatomy.© 2025 The Author(s).

Involvement of major pelvic neurovascular structures and bone was historically considered a contraindication due to unacceptably high rates of morbidity and low R0 resection rates.To compare the outcomes of these ""high-complexity"" exenterative resections to those of ""conventional"" pelvic exenteration.International multicenter retrospective cohort study.Sixteen specialized exenteration centers.Those who underwent total pelvic exenteration for locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer between 2018 and 2023 at participating centers.Perioperative resource utilization, morbidity, mortality, and R0 resection rates were reported.Seven hundred sixty-three patients underwent total pelvic exenteration, of whom 478 (63%) and 285 (37%) required conventional and high-complexity procedures, respectively. High-complexity pelvic exenteration was associated with longer operating time (600 vs 480 minutes, p < 0.001 for locally advanced primary rectal cancer, 623 vs 480 minutes, p < 0.001 for locally recurrent rectal cancer), intensive care stay (2 vs 1 day, p < 0.001 and 3 vs 1 day, p < 0.001), hospital stay (19 vs 15 days, p = 0.008 and 23 vs 15 days, p < 0.001), and higher blood loss (2000 vs 1236 mL, p < 0.001 and 3000 vs 1600 mL, p < 0.001). Morbidity and mortality outcomes and R0 resection rates were similar between the groups.Generalizability of findings outside of expert units.High-complexity pelvic exenteration for the treatment of rectal cancer is associated with similar morbidity, mortality, and R0 resection rates, but it has a significantly higher operative time, blood loss, and hospital resource utilization compared to conventional pelvic exenteration.

Pelvic exenteration involves removing the rectum, bladder, and sometimes other organs to completely remove the cancer. Historically, this procedure was only done if the cancer had not spread to major blood vessels or bones, as it was thought to be too risky otherwise. 

The researchers looked at data from 763 patients who underwent pelvic exenteration at 16 specialized cancer centers around the world. They compared patients who had the ""standard"" procedure to those who required a more complex surgery that involved removing additional structures like blood vessels or bones. They found that the complex surgeries took longer, required more time in the ICU and hospital, and involved more blood loss. However, the rates of complications, deaths, and complete tumor removal were similar between the two groups.

This suggests that even very complex pelvic exenteration procedures can be safely performed in experienced cancer centers, offering hope to patients with advanced rectal cancers that were previously considered inoperable.

41110629,2026-01-01,What's New in Membranous Nephropathy and How to Incorporate New Antigen Discoveries Into Clinical Practice: A Review.,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be seen in association with other diseases, including malignancy, drugs, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Over the last decade, great progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, resulting from the discovery of several target antigens by use of laser microdissection/mass spectrometry methodology. This technique has proven to be the most sensitive method available and has the advantage of testing for all the target antigens at one time. The discovery of these target antigens has now shifted the classification of MN from primary versus secondary to classification based on the target antigen identified. Each target antigen has its own specific clinical characteristics and known associated diseases. Identification of the target antigen can help further identify the underlying cause for a more targeted approach in looking for associated diseases. Progress has also been made in the treatment of patients with MN, with more standard risk stratification of the patients and a shift in using anti-CD20 drugs as the first line for those with moderate and high risk of progression. Trials are ongoing to further investigate the role of anti-plasma cell, anticomplement, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell) therapies.Copyright © 2025 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

41167303,2026-01-01,"Clinical Validation of Duoseq, a Novel Assay for Clinical DNA and RNA Sequencing.","Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become integral to the clinical workup of blood cancers. However, there remain barriers to implementing clinical NGS, including the separate workflows required for DNA and RNA sequencing, complex bioinformatics analyses, and long turnaround times. Duoseq has been developed as a comprehensive, kitted solution to these barriers and implemented as a genomic profiling tool for blood cancers to simultaneously detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs; translocations and fusions). Additionally, Duoseq can evaluate numerous other blood cancer diagnostic markers, including gene expression, copy number alterations, cell of origin, oncogenic viral status (eg, Epstein-Barr virus), B-/T-cell receptor clonality, Ig heavy chain mutational status, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Analytical and clinical validation of Duoseq was performed in parallel at two clinical institutions. Limit of detection was confirmed as 5% variant allele frequency for SNVs, 10% variant allele frequency for indels, and ≥20% tumor purity for SVs. Repeatability studies showed >99% intrarun and interrun positive predictive value and >96% percentage positive agreement. Duoseq was run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens (N = 197), using NGS and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization as orthogonal comparison. SNVs, indels, and SVs achieved accuracy of >95%.

Current genetic tests often require separate workflows for analyzing DNA and RNA, which can be complex and time-consuming. Duoseq is designed to overcome these challenges by simultaneously detecting a wide range of genetic changes in both DNA and RNA from a single patient sample. 

The researchers thoroughly tested Duoseq's accuracy and reliability by running it on hundreds of real patient samples and comparing the results to other established genetic tests. They found that Duoseq could accurately identify key genetic markers, such as mutations, rearrangements, and gene expression patterns, that are important for diagnosing and managing different types of blood cancers. Importantly, Duoseq was able to detect these genetic changes even when the tumor samples contained relatively low amounts of cancer cells.

41139188,2026-01-01,"Low Versus High Ligation of Inferior Mesenteric Artery in Rectal and Sigmoid Cancers: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","The optimal level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) ligation in rectosigmoid cancer surgery remains controversial, with ongoing debate about the balance between oncologic adequacy and anastomotic integrity. This meta-analysis compared high ligation (HL) versus low ligation (LL) of IMA in terms of postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).A systematic search of 5 databases (inception-May 2025) identified 15 RCTs comparing LL and HL in rectal or sigmoid cancer. Primary outcomes included 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall complications, and anastomotic leak (AL) rates. Secondary outcomes included lymph node yield, operative time, and blood loss. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were performed.A total of 2576 patients were included. LL significantly improved 5-year OS (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 0.026) and reduced AL rates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51-1.00; p = 0.050), without compromising DFS or lymph node yield. TSA confirmed the OS benefit and robustness of AL reduction, with the cumulative Z-curve crossing both the conventional and trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit. LL was not associated with increased overall complications, operative time, or blood loss.

The IMA is a major blood vessel that supplies the lower part of the colon, and there is ongoing debate about how high up the artery should be cut during these cancer operations. The researchers reviewed 15 previous studies that compared ""high ligation"" (cutting the IMA higher up) versus ""low ligation"" (cutting it lower down) to see which approach had better outcomes for patients. They found that low ligation significantly improved 5-year survival rates and reduced the risk of leaks at the surgical site, without compromising other important measures like lymph node removal. These findings suggest that low ligation of the IMA should be the preferred approach for rectal and sigmoid cancer surgeries, as it offers survival benefits and reduces complications for patients, though more research may still be needed to confirm these results. This study provides helpful guidance to surgeons on an important technical aspect of these common cancer operations, which could ultimately lead to better outcomes for many patients."
41177002,2026-01-01,Menstrual irregularities and cardiometabolic risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Menstrual cycle irregularities have been linked to several health hazards; it is unclear how these risks relate to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compile data regarding the relationship between irregular menstruation and women's cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes.A systematic search of online databases was conducted for studies comparing cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes between women with irregular and regular menstrual cycles. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated adopting a random effects model.Eight observational studies comprising 354,419 women were included. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a significantly increased risk of overall cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.01 to 2.03) compared to those with regular menstrual cycles. Subgroup analyses for specific cardiovascular outcomes demonstrated increased risks of coronary artery disease (RR: 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.14-1.46), hypertension (RR: 1.50, 95 % CI: 1.23-1.82) and heart failure (RR: 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.89) in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles. Additionally, the risk of cerebrovascular disease was higher in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles (RR: 1.62, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.40), Notably, patients with irregular menstrual cycles were found to have a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus (RR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.31-2.34) and hypercholesterolemia (RR: 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.52).Menstrual irregularities are associated with greater risks for several cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, highlighting the importance of regular check-ups to prevent disease occurrence in these patients.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have drawn attention for their impact on obesity. With a dense population of receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract, it is critical to understand the way that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists impact gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.To evaluate the expanding role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity and gastrointestinal disease, with a focus on therapeutic applications, impact on gastrointestinal cancers, safety profile, and implications for gastroenterology practice.We conducted a narrative review of recent clinical trials, cohort studies, and guideline updates through 2025. Evidence was synthesised on efficacy, safety, and clinical implications across gastrointestinal disorders including steatotic liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, and obesity-associated cancers.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists induce substantial and durable weight loss and improve obesity-related gastrointestinal outcomes. They are approved for steatotic liver disease, with demonstrated histologic and biochemical benefits. Evidence suggests a reduced incidence of several gastrointestinal cancers. The most common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and delayed gastric emptying, which may affect peri-endoscopic management. Discontinuation rates remain substantial but can be mitigated by careful titration and specialist oversight.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a critical therapy for obesity and several related gastrointestinal conditions.

After these procedures, some patients develop a condition called periprosthetic osteolysis, where the bone around the implant starts to break down. This can lead to implant loosening, pain, and the need for revision surgery. 

The researchers investigated how FSTL1 might contribute to this bone loss. They found that FSTL1 promotes the formation and activity of osteoclasts - cells that break down bone. FSTL1 appears to do this by activating a signaling pathway in osteoclasts called JNK. The researchers also showed that FSTL1 levels were higher in patients with periprosthetic osteolysis compared to those without complications.

These findings suggest that FSTL1 could be an important driver of implant-related bone loss. Therapies that target FSTL1 or the JNK pathway it activates may help prevent this complication and improve outcomes for joint replacement patients. However, more research is needed to fully"
41263784,2026-01-01,Relationship between aerobic fitness and adipose tissue insulin resistance.,"Aerobic fitness is associated with greater skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity with regard to glucose uptake. Whether fitness is associated with an improvement in the insulin regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis is unknown. We collated adipose insulin sensitivity, body composition, and fitness data from six of our previously published and two of our unpublished protocols. Adipose tissue insulin resistance index of palmitate (ADIPO-IRpalmitate) data were available for 340 volunteers, and the insulin concentration resulting in a 50% suppression of palmitate rate of appearance (FFApalmitate IC50) measured using the insulin clamp technique was available for 108 volunteers. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the independent variables of aerobic fitness [peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak), mL kg·FFM-1·min-1], age, sex, body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), body fat, percent body fat, and the dependent variables ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Factors that were univariately correlated (P < 0.001) with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 were BMI, percent body fat, body fat, and VAT. Fitness correlated negatively with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Stepwise regression analysis showed that fitness independently predicted ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 after adjusting for the other significant factors. These findings suggest that aerobic fitness may promote metabolic health through positive effects on adipose tissue.

41178536,2026-01-01,Performance of Large Language Models in Analyzing Common Hypertension Scenarios.,"Hypertension, the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, remains suboptimally controlled. Large language models (LLMs) could improve hypertension control by augmenting clinical decision-making, but their reliability for guideline-driven tasks is unverified. This study evaluated the accuracy and safety of hypertension management recommendations generated by 3 LLMs.Fifty-one vignettes were constructed and submitted to the LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Medical Large Language Model [by Google; MedLM]) and a hypertension expert to generate the responses. Three blinded reviewers rated each response on a 4-point accuracy scale, a binary safety (safe/unsafe) scale, and attempted to identify the source (LLM versus expert) providing the response.GPT-4 had the highest accuracy (83%) and safety (86%) scores among LLMs but remained inferior to expert responses (92% accuracy, 93% safety). Gemini and MedLM performed significantly worse (accuracy: 64% and 35%; safety: 73% and 39%, respectively). GPT-4 generated the most guideline-concordant responses (46%) among the 3 LLMs (Gemini 35%, MedLM 14%) but was lower than expert responses (68%). Interrater reliability for accuracy ratings was higher for LLM-generated responses (GPT-4 [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.30], Gemini [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.61], and MedLM [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.58]), with lower agreement for expert responses (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.23). A similar pattern was observed for safety and source discrimination ratings. The agreement was strongest for safety assessments and weakest for source discrimination.Among the 3 tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrated closer agreement to expert decisions, thereby showing greater potential for supporting hypertension management. Despite their potential, current LLM versions are inferior to expert recommendations.

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of severe pain during the 1-week period after RCT among consecutive patients requiring RCT and to identify pre-operative and intra-operative predictors of post-RCT severe pain in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network.This prospective cohort study enrolled patients across 153 general and endodontic practices. Eligible adults undergoing RCT completed surveys before and 1 week after treatment. Severe post-RCT pain was defined as patient-reported worst pain ≥7 on a 0-10 scale in the prior 7 days. Demographic, clinical, procedural, and psychosocial characteristics were collected and analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, accounting for clustering by practice.Among 1,059 patients, mean worst pain scores declined significantly from 5.3 pre-RCT to 2.6 post-RCT (p<.001). However, 14% reported severe pain at 1 week. Female sex, severe pain at time of RCT, screening positive for temporomandibular disorders, diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and having taken pain medication for tooth pain in the 7 days prior to RCT, were each significantly associated with severe post-RCT pain. Neither age, tooth type, provider specialty status, or psychosocial characteristics were independently predictive. Presence of a draining sinus tract and use of over 5x magnification were protective.One in seven patients reported severe pain in the first week after RCT, primarily associated with pre-operative pain factors and patient sex, underscoring the value of targeted pain management for high-risk patients.Despite overall pain reduction after RCT, 14% of patients experience severe pain at one week.

These diseases are associated with bowel disturbances, which should be evaluated preferably with questionnaires, and with anal weakness and/or DD, often evident on a thorough digital rectal examination. Fissures and DD are closely linked to constipation, whereas FI is typically associated with diarrhea. For most patients with mild symptoms, lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and/or pharmacotherapy suffice. Some patients require tests to rule out serious diseases; assess anorectal functions, which are discussed in detail; and to identify structural abnormalities, such as rectoceles, which are occasionally clinically significant. Treatments are applied stepwise, starting with conservative therapy with simpler treatments when feasible (eg, rubber band ligation for grade I-II hemorrhoids), with surgery, usually excisional hemorrhoidectomy, being reserved for more severe disease; for anal fissures, topical therapy using a calcium channel antagonist or nitroglycerine, followed by botulinum toxin and, less frequently, lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic fissures. Anorectal biofeedback therapy is effective for managing DD and, together with bowel modifiers tailored to the specific symptoms (ie, constipation and/or diarrhea), is also used for FI. Biofeedback therapy is not widely accessible, and many patients are treated by pelvic floor physical therapists. For FI, minimally invasive options include sacral neuromodulation and anal dextranomer injection, with colostomy or anal sphincteroplasty now rarely required.

Global longitudinal strain with apical sparing is a hallmark finding that distinguishes cardiac amyloidosis from other cardiomyopathies. Left atrial strain has been proposed as a prognostic marker for thromboembolism in cardiac amyloidosis. Evidence shows variability in strain measurements across different vendors, which is an important consideration when comparing results between institutions in both research and clinical practice. Echocardiography can be used in conjunction with multimodal imaging techniques in order to monitor disease progression.Echocardiography is the initial diagnostic test of choice and several findings can suggest cardiac amyloidosis. Advances in echocardiographic techniques have enabled earlier detection of cardiac involvement and now play a central role in both diagnosis and ongoing treatment monitoring.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers explain that classic echocardiographic ""red flags"" for amyloidosis include thickened heart walls, enlarged chambers, and a grainy appearance of the heart muscle. Advanced techniques like tissue Doppler imaging and strain measurements can also help identify characteristic patterns of heart function that point to amyloidosis. These advances allow for earlier diagnosis, which is crucial since prompt treatment can significantly improve outcomes for patients. The review also notes that echocardiography can be used alongside other imaging tests to track how the disease progresses over time.

41213408,2026-01-01,"GPR39 and GPR40 in epilepsy: a potential therapeutic target for rational drug design, pathophysiology, current understanding and challenges.","G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most abundant family of transmembrane proteins that regulate a variety of physiological functions and are the molecular target of more than 35 % of currently authorised medicines. Recent structural biology advances have significantly improved our understanding of GPCRs activation mechanisms and their interactions with G-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways, where they regulate neurotransmission at synapses and maintain neuronal homeostasis by activating heterotrimeric G-protein (Gαβγ). Evidence from preclinical studies suggests that GPCRs enhance neuronal excitability, especially in epilepsy, a condition impacting about 1-2% of the global population. Currently approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) mainly target ion channels but fail to address key pathological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, synaptic remodelling, and imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission. These unresolved mechanisms, combined with the side effects of AEDs, present a significant therapeutic gap in seizure treatment and drug-resistant seizures. This gap in therapy highlights the need for ongoing research into novel molecular targets for more effective epilepsy treatments. The keywords GPR39, GPR40, epilepsy, seizure, convulsive, and GPCRs were used to search PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This review explores recent insights into the roles of specific GPCR families in initiating, spreading, or attenuating seizures. It also discusses challenges in developing GPCR-targeted therapies and suggests strategies to overcome these obstacles. A particular focus is placed on GPR39 and GPR40, highlighting their roles in seizure modulation and their potential to prevent epileptogenesis and neuroinflammation.

41202582,2026-01-01,Guidelines and Checklists for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Surgical Education Research: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been used in clinical and healthcare research, prompting the development of new research guidelines to ensure its appropriate use. Similarly, AI has been applied to surgical education research, creating a need to assess the relevance and applicability of existing guidelines in this context. This narrative review synthesized guidelines and checklists related to AI in surgical education, providing researchers with an introductory roadmap for conducting rigorous, reproducible studies and identifying gaps for future framework development.In April 2024, the authors conducted a search using Ovid (Embase and MEDLINE(R)) from 1946 to 2024 to identify guidelines and checklists related to AI research in healthcare and surgical education. Search teams included ""artifical intelligence"" and related terms, as well as ""checklist"", ""recommendations"", and terms related to evaluation, reporting, and guidelines. Titles and abstracts were screened and the authors reviewed eligible full-text articles for inclusion through consensus discussions.From 200 studies identified, 47 full-text articles were reviewed, and 16 guidelines and checklists were included. These were grouped into six thematic categories: AI research with health education applications, Generative AI and Large Language Model studies, machine learning/prediction models, AI in imaging, and forthcoming guidelines. Key findings highlighted the diversity in purpose, methodology, and scope. Although gaps were identified in existing guidelines and checklists for surgical education, with only one tailored to AI research in healthcare education, the authors demonstrated how these other resources could be applied.This review highlighted that while existing guidelines and checklists could be applied in certain contexts, significant gaps remained in education-specific research guidance.

Phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing treatment intensification with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), docetaxel (D), or both were included. Mixed treatment comparisons were conducted for overall population and for each prognostic subgroup (SHV, SLV, MHV, and MLV). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were assessed.The current report of a living systematic review includes a total of 11 trials (12 668 patients and 12 unique treatments). In the overall population, the results were consistent with those of a previous report. An analysis of OS by prespecified subgroups included nine clinical trials (8990 patients and eight unique treatments). In the SHV subgroup (N = 5171; 57%), ARPI + D + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with D + ADT (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.83) and ARPI + ADT (0.71; 0.53-0.97). In the SLV subgroup (N = 2455; 27%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.65; 0.52-0.80). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.08; 0.65-1.79). In the MHV subgroup (N = 589; 6.5%), no statistically significant improvement was observed with ARPI + D + ADT compared with ARPI + ADT (0.89; 0.43-1.85) and D + ADT (0.90; 0.60-1.36). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + ADT and D + ADT (1.02; 0.45-2.28). In the MLV subgroup (N = 775; 8.5%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.43; 0.29-0.64) and D + ADT (0.41; 0.24-0.70). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.56; 0.40-6.25). Inherent limitations of this analysis include the inability to account for all relevant variables such as the patient- and cancer-related factors that likely influenced the decision of physicians to offer docetaxel to patients.Current evidence suggests that triplet systemic therapy is preferred for patients with SHV mHSPC who are fit for docetaxel. Androgen receptor pathway doublet therapy is preferred for all other patient subgroups compared with ADT alone. There is no role of docetaxel doublet in patients with access to ARPI therapy and if they are able to receive it.Copyright © 2025.

The researchers analyzed data from multiple clinical trials to compare the survival rates of men receiving different combinations of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and newer targeted drugs called androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). 

They found that for men with a large volume of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, a combination of all three treatments (hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and ARPIs) led to the best survival outcomes. However, for men with a smaller volume of metastatic disease, either hormone therapy plus ARPIs or hormone therapy alone were more effective than adding chemotherapy. The results also varied depending on whether the cancer had spread at the time of diagnosis or developed metastases later. This suggests that the best treatment approach may depend on the individual patient's specific circumstances.

41189469,2026-01-01,Senotherapeutics for metabolic disease and diabetic complications.,"Metabolic diseases, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome, are increasingly prevalent worldwide, driven by sedentary lifestyles, aging populations, and complex genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally understood as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, a growing body of evidence now implicates cellular senescence as a central, age-related contributor to metabolic dysfunction. Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in key metabolic tissues where they disrupt tissue function through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic secretome. SASP factors exacerbate insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and tissue remodeling, advancing the progression and complications of metabolic diseases. These insights have catalyzed the development of senotherapeutics, a class of interventions that includes senolytics (to eliminate SCs), senomorphics (to suppress SASP), and senosensitizers (to render resistant SCs more vulnerable to clearance). Although preclinical studies show promise, translation into clinical practice faces significant challenges, including identifying reliable biomarkers, understanding SC heterogeneity, and optimizing treatment timing and safety. As research advances, senotherapeutics may offer a transformative approach not only to managing metabolic diseases but also to mitigating associated comorbidities. The recognition that antidiabetic agents already in clinical use can modulate key features of senescence highlights a unique translational opportunity, suggesting that prevention of age-related metabolic disorders may be achievable with therapies already available in routine clinical practice. Medicine is poised to enter a new era in which targeting cellular senescence could fundamentally reshape the prevention and treatment of age-related metabolic disorders, offering the potential for improved healthspan and reduced disease burden across the lifespan.© 2025 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.",Journal of internal medicine,"Jan, 2026",2026,Jan,,Allyson K Palmer|Rosa Spinelli|Larissa GL Prata|Selim Chaib|Masayoshi Suda|Tamar Tchkonia|Ulf Smith|James L Kirkland,Allyson K Palmer,"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.|Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.|Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.","Allyson K Palmer, Rosa Spinelli, Larissa GL Prata, Selim Chaib, Masayoshi Suda, Tamar Tchkonia, Ulf Smith, James L Kirkland",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41189469/,"Metabolic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are becoming more common worldwide due to factors like sedentary lifestyles and aging populations.

41187859,2026-01-01,Frequent EPHA2 receptor mutations in cholangiocarcinoma disrupt receptor forward signaling supporting a tumor suppressor role.,"Although EPHA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase widely expressed in many cancers, it exhibits a uniquely high frequency of coding sequence mutations in cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the biliary tract with dismal prognosis. EPHA2 is extensively studied, but very little is known about the role of EPHA2 cancer mutations. To define the functional significance of EPHA2 mutations in biliary tract cancers, we generated representative EPHA2 mutants and monitored major receptor autophosphorylation sites as indicators of kinase activity-dependent signal transduction (known as forward signaling). We found that missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain abrogate ephrinA ligand binding, while missense mutations in the kinase domain abrogate kinase activity. The effects of missense mutations in other domains were less pronounced and varied depending on the phosphosite. The majority of the EPHA2 mutations are nonsense or frame-shift mutations that introduce early stop codons. They generate EPHA2 truncated forms that lack an intact kinase domain or, in some cases, most of the coding sequence. Several EPHA2 mutants tested inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of co-expressed EPHA2 wild-type, indicating the ability to exert dominant negative effects. We show that EPHA2 forward signaling in cholangiocytes inhibits the ERK oncogenic pathway and cell proliferation, suggesting that loss-of-function mutations facilitate tumor development in the biliary tract. Indeed, an EPHA2 kinase-inactive mutant, but not EPHA2 wild-type, induced proliferative masses consistent with well differentiated cholangiocarcinoma in a validated mouse model of cholangiocarcinogenesis. Thus, EPHA2 has the attributes of a driver gene with tumor suppressor activity in biliary tract cancers.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SDAVFs are abnormal connections between arteries and veins in the spine that can disrupt blood flow and damage the spinal cord. In this study, the researchers describe a case of an SDAVF originating from an unusual location - the superior gluteal artery, which is located in the buttocks. 

The researchers used advanced imaging techniques to carefully diagnose and characterize this patient's SDAVF. They then performed a complex surgical procedure to close off the abnormal blood vessel connection, which is the standard treatment for this condition. The surgery was successful in resolving the patient's symptoms, which included weakness, numbness, and difficulty walking. 

This case report provides important insights for healthcare providers, as it demonstrates that SDAVFs can arise from unexpected locations outside the usual spinal cord blood vessels. Early and accurate diagnosis of SDAVFs is critical, as prompt treatment can often reverse the nerve damage and restore function for patients. While SDAVFs are rare, increased awareness of this condition and its"

The researchers analyzed the medical records and genetic test results of these patients to see how the low JAK2 V617F levels related to their symptoms and disease course. They found that even at very low levels, the mutation was often associated with blood disorders like polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. Over time, the mutation levels tended to increase in many patients, suggesting the cancer was progressing.

We aimed to evaluate the association between serum Hcy levels and the risk of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis in a large, diverse population, accounting for clinical confounders and effect modifiers such as sex and reproductive status.We analyzed 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 8253 adults (≥18 years) without hepatitis B/C, excessive alcohol use, or pregnancy. MASLD was defined using the fatty liver index (≥30), and fibrosis risk was assessed using age-adjusted Fibrosis-4 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score among MASLD subjects (N = 5328). Associations between serum Hcy and MASLD/fibrosis risk were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for confounders, with stratification by sex and menopausal status.Serum Hcy levels were higher among those with MASLD (fatty liver index ≥30), though the association was attenuated after covariate adjustment. Among MASLD individuals, those at higher fibrosis risk (based on Fibrosis-4 or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score) had significantly elevated Hcy levels. This association remained significant in men and postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women.Elevated serum Hcy is independently associated with hepatic fibrosis risk in MASLD, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.

Identification of these antibodies has treatment and prognostic implications. We compared patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and high-titer GAD65 antibodies to an age- and sex-matched control group with drug-resistant GAD65 antibody-negative temporal lobe epilepsy. From 1432 patients presented at a single-center surgical epilepsy conference (2007-2024), we identified 15 patients (1% from surgical epilepsy conference: 13 female, 86.7%) with high-titer serum GAD65 antibodies (median serum titer = 960 nmol/L; range 34-4678). The median age at epilepsy onset was 25 years (range 4-44). All had temporal regional-onset epilepsy; 53% had bitemporal seizures. Three patients had limbic encephalitis, and three developed mesial temporal sclerosis. Those with GAD65 antibody-associated epilepsy were more likely to have depression and/or anxiety and less likely to undergo resection after evaluation than those in the control group. Although seizure types, electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and autoimmune history were not statistically significantly different from the control group, we found that musicogenic seizures, limbic encephalitis, and type 1 diabetes occurred only in GAD65-positive patients. These features, when present, may suggest an autoimmune etiology and warrant antibody testing. Identifying patients with GAD65 antibody-associated epilepsy is important due to its drug resistance, lower rate of satisfactory surgical outcomes, and potential responsiveness to immunotherapy.

41241792,2026-01-01,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals T cell heterogeneity and metabolic reprogramming in human immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.,"Immune-mediated glomerulonephritis (IMGN) is a major cause of kidney failure worldwide, yet the precise roles of T cells in its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. However, existing studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and functional roles of IMGN T cells in the human context. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing targeted therapies. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) data from three primary IMGN types-IgA nephropathy (IgAN), lupus nephritis (LN), and membranous nephropathy (MN)-we identified T cell subtype alterations at single-cell resolution. Utilizing advanced sc-RNA-seq computational pipelines, we constructed gene co-expression networks (GCNs), inferred T-cell differentiation trajectories, and assessed metabolic and intercellular signaling features. IMGN kidneys presented expanded T-cell compartments, with significant enrichment of cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) cells and GZMK⁺ effector memory T (GZMK⁺ Tem) cells. Notably, LTB⁺ memory T cells (LTB⁺ Tm) were selectively elevated in IgAN and LN patients. A coexpression module centered on RGS1 was significantly correlated with 24-h proteinuria (p < 0.001). Metabolic profiling revealed subtype-specific disruptions in the glutathione (GSH) and 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate (3PD) pathways. Interaction analysis highlighted endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and fibroblasts as key mediators of pathogenic T-cell activation via defined ligand‒receptor pairs.

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, and random-effects meta-analyses were performed.Eight studies with a total of 242,275 women were included. For bilateral oophorectomy, the effect size (ES) was greater than 1.0 in 5 of 8 studies. The pooled analysis showed a significant association between premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy and an increased risk of PD in cohort studies (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32; 95% CI 1.12-1.56) but not in case-control studies or combining both cohort and case-control studies. There was a suggestive trend of increasing risk with younger age at bilateral oophorectomy. For hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, the ES was greater than 1.0 in all six studies. The pooled analysis showed a non-significant association in cohort studies and in case-control studies; however, the association was significant when combining both cohort studies and case-control studies (ES 1.19; 95% CI 1.01-1.41).Current studies provided low to moderate evidence for the associations between bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy with ovarian conservation and increased risk of PD.

41474120,2026-01-01,Autonomic Dysfunction and Risk of Mortality in Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease.,"Dysautonomia affects many patients with Parkinson's disease and correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality. We describe the frequency and onset time of autonomic dysfunction relative to disease onset in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and explore its association with mortality.We identified all incident Parkinson cases with motor-symptom onset before age 50 years evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Health System (1990-2022) including sex- and age-matched controls for each patient. Medical record review confirmed clinical diagnosis and assessed the presence and onset of autonomic symptoms, relative to Parkinson onset.We included 829 patients with EOPD and 829 healthy controls. The median age at disease onset was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 37-46 years). Autonomic symptoms were present in 63.4% of patients, compared with 27.0% of unaffected controls, and proceeded motor symptoms in 91.4%. Forty-seven percent of patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease had constipation, 27.4% had bladder urgency, 19.3% had orthostatic intolerance, and 15.4% had sweat dysfunction. Among male patients, 36.8% had erectile dysfunction. In our EOPD population only, the presence of any autonomic-impairment symptoms correlated with a 2.71-fold increased mortality risk; each additional reported symptom increased the relative mortality risk by 50% (p < 0.001). Patients with constipation or orthostatic intolerance had a 3.22- and 2.78-fold higher mortality than patients without these symptoms.Autonomic impairment affects 63.4% of patients with EOPD and carries a 3-fold higher mortality risk, which increases with every additional autonomic symptom reported.

41474183,2026-01-01,Basal EMG Amplitude in REM and NREM Sleep as a Predictor of Disease Progression in Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"This study examined whether basal electromyographic (EMG) amplitude during sleep is altered in patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and its relationship to disease progression, as well as changes across the sleep cycle.Baseline polysomnograms collected from 95 iRBD patients (15 converters, 80 non-converters) and matched 24 controls were analyzed. EMG amplitude was calculated from submentalis recordings across all sleep stages using 3-second mini-epochs, with REM sleep further classified as REM sleep without atonia (RWA) and non-RWA (RA) according to the presence of ""any"" RWA events. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed phenoconversion risk, and EMG amplitude was compared between early and late sleep cycles within each group.Group comparisons with post-hoc adjustment showed that EMG amplitude in RA and RWA was higher in non-converters than controls (adj-p<.001), while converters showed further increases of EMG amplitude in N2 and N3 (adj-p<.045). RA amplitude was higher in converters than non-converters (adj-p=.02). Increased EMG amplitude in N2, N3, and RA was associated with higher phenoconversion risk (p<.05). EMG amplitude remained stable between early and late cycles during RA in both iRBD and controls. In contrast, iRBD patients showed a significant decrease in EMG amplitude during late cycles in N2 (p<.009).Elevated basal EMG amplitude during both REM and NREM sleep in iRBD patients shows potential as a prognostic marker, indicating muscle tone dysregulation beyond REM atonia loss and underscoring the need to consider broader sleep stages in iRBD evaluation.© The Author(s) 2025.

The researchers wanted to see if measuring muscle activity during different sleep stages could help predict which iRBD patients were more likely to develop these more serious conditions over time.

The researchers analyzed sleep recordings from 95 iRBD patients and 24 healthy controls. They measured muscle activity in the chin area and looked at how it changed across the different stages of sleep. They found that iRBD patients, especially those who later developed Parkinson's or similar disorders, had higher muscle activity not just during REM sleep, but also during the deeper, non-REM stages of sleep. This suggests that iRBD involves broader problems with muscle tone regulation throughout the sleep cycle, not just the loss of REM sleep paralysis.

These findings indicate that measuring muscle activity during both REM and non-REM sleep could help identify iRBD patients at highest risk of disease progression. This information could guide"

We investigated the tumorigenic roles of EZH2 and intracellular molecules in JAK2+/- myeloid neoplasms. EZH2 is upregulated in AML and non-leukemic myeloid neoplasms (M/N) and is associated with H3K27me3 co-expression. EZH2 overexpression is correlated with p-STAT3 and MYC upregulation in JAK2+ M/N, but only with MYC activation in JAK2- M/N. In JAK2+ myeloid neoplasms, p-STAT3, p-ERK1/2, and MYC showed a significantly elevated percentage of tumor cell positivity in AML compared to M/N group. In JAK2- cases, MYC, but not p-STAT3 or p-ERK1/2, showed significantly elevated percentage of tumor cell positivity in AML compared to M/N group. In conclusion, EZH2 plays an oncogenic role through overexpression in its wild-type myeloid neoplasms. EZH2, p-STAT3, MYC, and p-ERK1/2 upregulation associate differently with disease progression depending on JAK2 mutation status.

Multidien seizure cyclicity is a prevalent, patient-specific phenomenon with promise for epilepsy management. We challenge the assertion that cycle tracking is no better than a moving average, which is an inherently retrospective model that lags changes in seizure likelihood. This commentary compared a causal cyclic forecast to a prospectively applied moving average across a large seizure diary cohort (n = 768) and two gold-standard chronic EEG cohorts (n = 24). For the EEG and diary cohorts, cycle tracking demonstrated significantly superior accuracy to the moving average for both hourly and daily forecasts (p < 0.0001), using multiple performance metrics. These results confirm that event-based cyclical models offer more accurate, simulated real-world forecasts. Robust forecasting tools must prioritize the detection and modeling of seizure cycles to move beyond simple baseline performance and provide actionable clinical utility.© 2025 International League Against Epilepsy.",Epilepsia,"Dec 31, 2025",2025,Dec,31,Rachel E Stirling|Benjamin H Brinkmann|Dean R Freestone|Philippa J Karoly,Benjamin H Brinkmann,"Graeme Clark Institute and Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Rachel E Stirling, Benjamin H Brinkmann, Dean R Freestone, Philippa J Karoly",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474376/,"This research paper examines different methods for predicting seizures in people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological condition that causes recurrent seizures, which can be unpredictable and disruptive to daily life. Accurately forecasting when seizures are likely to occur could help patients better manage their condition and prepare for potential episodes.

The researchers compared two approaches: tracking a person's natural seizure cycles over multiple days versus using a simple statistical average of recent seizure activity. They tested these methods on a large group of people with epilepsy who kept seizure diaries, as well as two smaller groups with continuous brain activity monitoring. The results showed that the cyclic forecasting model was significantly more accurate than the moving average in predicting both hourly and daily seizure likelihood.

This suggests that accounting for an individual's unique seizure patterns and cycles is crucial for developing effective seizure forecasting tools. Such personalized models could provide patients with valuable advance warning, allowing them to take preventative measures or seek help when a seizure is imminent.

Multimodality imaging, including transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac CT and coronary angiography, confirmed the diagnosis. The PFE was surgically resected to prevent embolic complications, while the CCFs were managed conservatively due to their haemodynamic insignificance. This case demonstrates that even extensive CCFs may be haemodynamically insignificant, while a small PFE can pose a significant embolic threat, justifying disparate management strategies guided by multimodality imaging and haemodynamic assessment.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2025.

Among 235 RRMM patients who received cilta-cel, 15 (6.4%) developed IEC-NP and 9 (3.8%) developed IEC-PKS with one patient developing both. Pre-infusion, patients with age >75 years, bone marrow plasma cells ≥20%, or involved free light chain ≥20 mg/dL had increased odds of IEC-PKS. Post-infusion, patients who developed ICANS, received higher cumulative steroid doses or received >1 dose of tocilizumab also had increased odds of IEC-PKS. High peak absolute lymphocyte count (ALCpeak) was a statistically significant predictor on univariate and multivariate analysis for IEC-NP and IEC-PKS. ALCpeak ≥ 3 × 109/L was identified as a meaningful threshold (AUC = 0.838) to predict for late onset neurotoxicity. An ALCpeak ≥ 3 × 109/L conferred a positive predictive value for delayed neurotoxicity of 31% vs a negative predictive value of 98% in patients with ALCpeak < 3 × 109/L.

Here, we used germ-free mice colonized with human donor stool from the United States and Thailand to investigate how person-to-person transmission of gut commensals - via shared air and physical contact - affects U.S. and Thai microbiomes and subsequent health outcomes. We found that both air sharing and physical contact enabled bidirectional transmission: U.S. mucus-degrading taxa (e.g., Akkermansia) was transferred into Thai microbiomes, while Thai-derived, potentially health-promoting bacteria colonized U.S. microbiomes. The host's baseline gut microbiome composition emerged as a key factor influencing the extent of the microbial remodeling. When exposed to 13 dietary ingredients and food additives prevalent in industrialized diets, the U.S. microbiome responded differently from its Thai counterpart, with food additives reducing Akkermansia. Corroborating these changes, the U.S. microbiome showed a predisposition toward weight gain under industrialized dietary conditions. However, sharing air supply or co-housing mitigated this effect - likely through the transfer of health-promoting bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus).

Information to guide sustainment of complex, multicomponent interventions in routine clinical practice after grant funding ends has had limited attention in the literature.The purpose of this article is to describe the efforts of our multidisciplinary trial team to foster sustainment of key components of a complex electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated symptom surveillance and management intervention for people receiving cancer care at a Midwestern quaternary medical center or community practice settings.The parent Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial assessed the effectiveness of a multicomponent EHR-facilitated, collaborative care model-based intervention for management of SPPADE symptoms (sleep interference, pain, impaired physical function, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit/fatigue) and its implementation in medical oncology and community practice settings. The dynamic sustainability framework (DSF) posits the need for on-going efforts to continuously optimize the fit of an intervention within dynamic and evolving delivery contexts. This brief report uses the DSF to describe our team's efforts to optimize the fit of the core E2C2 intervention components to the practice setting and broader ecological system during the conduct of the trial. These activities were designed to achieve sustained implementation of the intervention in routine care delivery as the funded research activities concluded.Core intervention components to be sustained were symptom surveillance using electronic patient-reported outcome measures, clinician alerts for severe symptoms, access to a registered nurse symptom care manager (RN SCM) for severe symptoms, patient education materials to support symptom self-management, access to a website of cancer-related materials, and the training and supervision of the RN SCMs.Sustainability is dynamic and multidimensional, and emphasizes the importance of optimizing the fit of key intervention components to the care delivery context as it evolves time. Investigators are advised to plan sustainability efforts early, embrace change inherent in dynamic settings, and carefully track adaptations of intervention components to maximize intervention fit in real-world clinical practice to ensure patients continue to derive benefit from evidence-informed care.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

38349134,2026-01-01,The Association and Utility of Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure in Predicting the Development of and in Managing Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a significant complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography, and its development is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) provides one index of left heart filling status. An elevated LVEDP can reflect volume overload or abnormal diastolic function and indicates a cardiac disorder. Data on the association between an elevated LVEDP and CIN are limited and have had conflicting results. We systematically searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for full-text articles from database inception to May 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated the association between a high LVEDP and the incidence of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The study was registered in the PROSPERO CRD42022334070. A second search in PubMed identified randomized controlled trials using LVEDP to guide fluid administration during coronary procedures. Four studies were identified that used LVEDP to classify patients into groups to determine the association between the level and the development of CIN. In these studies, 240 patients of 2441 patients (9.8%) developed CIN. One study found no association between LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. Two studies found an increased frequency of CIN in patients with elevated levels using 2 cutoff points for LVEDP, ≥20 mm Hg and >30 mm Hg. One study found that lower LVEDP levels (5-14 mm Hg) were associated with the development of CIN. Three randomized control trials used LVDEP levels to manage fluid administration in patients undergoing coronary procedures; only one study found that the use of these levels to guide fluid administration resulted in better outcomes. In patients undergoing coronary angiography, an elevated LVEDP was not consistently associated with increased risk of CIN, and using LVEDP levels to guide fluid administration during these procedures did not always improve outcomes in comparison to other protocols. The use of LVEDP levels can help classify patients with cardiac disorders but does not necessarily provide an adequate description of the hemodynamic patterns in these patients to predict or prevent CIN in patients undergoing angiography.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study looked at whether measuring a specific heart pressure, called left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), could help predict and manage the risk of CIN in these patients. 

The researchers reviewed several previous studies that had examined the link between LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. They found mixed results - some studies showed higher LVEDP was associated with more CIN, while others found no link or even a connection between lower LVEDP and CIN. The researchers also looked at studies that used LVEDP measurements to guide fluid management during coronary procedures, but again the results were inconsistent in terms of improving patient outcomes. 

Overall, this research suggests that while LVEDP can provide information about a patient's heart function, it does not reliably predict or prevent the occurrence of CIN in those undergoing coronary angiography. More research is needed to better understand the complex factors that contribute to this serious complication and find effective ways"
38230923,2026-01-01,Endocardial Fibroelastosis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Endocardial fibroelastosis emerged as a challenging clinical phenomenon in the 1940s. It is characterized by an atypical proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue within the heart and is primarily observed in childhood, occasionally displaying familial inheritance. While the precise cause remains elusive, various factors, including genetic, infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, oncologic, and medication-related influences, appear to play a role in its pathogenesis. The coexistence of endocardial fibroelastosis with multiple cardiac structural abnormalities manifests in symptoms of congestive heart failure and rhythm abnormalities. Despite its challenging diagnosis, various findings from ECG and imaging have proven beneficial in further evaluation of this condition. Finally, the treatment approach to endocardial fibroelastosis became complex due to addressing its concurrent cardiac abnormalities. Strategies for managing and preventing this condition are still under investigation. In this review, we intend to highlight the existing knowledge and illuminate future considerations regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It involves the abnormal growth of fibrous and elastic tissue inside the heart, which can lead to heart failure and irregular heartbeats. This review article aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of what is currently known about this condition, including its potential causes, how it is diagnosed, and how it is treated.

The researchers examined the existing scientific literature on endocardial fibroelastosis, which has been a medical challenge since it was first identified in the 1940s. They found that the condition may be linked to a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, infections, metabolic disorders, and certain medications. Diagnosing endocardial fibroelastosis can be difficult, but electrocardiograms and imaging tests can help identify the characteristic changes in the heart. Treatment often involves managing the symptoms and any associated heart abnormalities, but more research is needed to develop more effective therapies.

This review highlights the importance of continued study into endocardial fibroelastosis, as it remains a rare and poorly understood condition that can have severe consequences, especially for"
