41275242,Hospice enrollment in young adult LGBTQ + decedents with cancer: a multi-site single healthcare system study.,"Hospice is specialized medical care that strives to provide comfort to dying patients. To our knowledge, no study has examined the percentage of young adult LGBTQ + patients with cancer who enrolled in hospice and circumstances that surround enrollment/non-enrollment.A single healthcare system, 4000 + self-reported LGBTQ + database of patients with cancer identified young adult decedents (18-39 years old at death) to report the percentage who died with hospice, the conversations that preceded hospice enrollment, time-on-hospice, and circumstances that surrounded the deaths of those not enrolled.From the database, 43 decedents were identified with a median age at death (range) of 33 years old (20, 39 years). Twenty had self-identified as gay/lesbian, and 23 as bisexual. Twenty-nine decedents (67% (95% CI: 51, 81%)) were enrolled in hospice (3 not enrolled and died unexpectedly; 11 with unknown hospice outcome). Conversations that preceded enrollment discussed (1) limited cancer therapeutic options with worsening end-of-life symptoms and how hospice could help (""discussed… decline and how patient would not want to die hooked up to machines""); (2) medical staff's acknowledgement of same sex spouse/life partners (""[She] is here with her wife""); (3) the inclusion of the birth family in end-of-life discussions, especially if the decedent had been single (""Her father met us… this was difficult news for him to hear.""). Four of 18 decedents with known date of hospice enrollment died 3 or fewer days after enrollment.Most young adult LGBTQ + decedents with cancer receive hospice services with thoughtful and inclusive conversations that precede enrollment. For some, time-on-hospice appears limited.© 2025.

41275003,Workload and usability evaluation of the da Vinci SP and Xi during low anterior resections.,"Robotic surgeries have become increasingly popular in the last 20 years, spurring technological innovations.In this observational study, we compared the workload of Intuitive's da Vinci Single Port (SP) with the da Vinci Xi.We evaluated two surgeons during 24 total low anterior resection surgeries at a large academic hospital, with 12 surgeries utilizing the SP and 12 with the Xi. Surveys were administered to both surgeons and their teams before and after each surgery. Surgeons self-evaluated their workloads (mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, success/performance, effort, frustration, difficulty, fatigue) and the usability of each platform (efficiency and precision of the surgical instruments and camera, touchpad usage, confidence) via survey.Analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental and physical workloads (p-value ≤ 0.05) during the vascular dissection subsection, with higher demands in the SP than the Xi and the circulating nurse noting greater effort levels in the SP than the Xi. The robot platform significantly affected robot usability, with surgeons stating that the Xi was more precise and efficient in surgical instrument and camera usage than the SP, leading to higher confidence scores in the Xi.Only two surgeons were surveyed, and the da Vinci SP was novel and likely associated with a learning curve.Usability differences may explain differences in workloads and confidence. Understanding these differences between the robots can aid in selecting optimal cases for each platform.© 2025.

41270809,Pharmacogenomic Testing.,"Clinical laboratories are increasingly implementing pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing. Although PGx is similar to genetic testing for other indications, there are unique aspects that laboratories should consider.To aid clinical laboratories that are implementing clinical PGx testing by describing characteristics of PGx test design and validation, as well as approaches to reporting. Resources that are useful for clinical laboratories performing PGx testing will be highlighted.The College of American Pathologists formed a workgroup composed of laboratorians with expertise in clinical PGx testing. The workgroup included representatives from the Association for Molecular Pathology and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The workgroup reviewed pertinent literature, as well as experience from proficiency testing and from members' laboratories.The workgroup recommends that laboratories implementing PGx consider the following concepts: testing platform, test design (ie, selection of pharmacogenes and variants/alleles), use of reference materials during test development and as controls during clinical runs, star allele and standard nomenclature systems, translations from genotype to predicted phenotype, and considerations for result reporting including making medication recommendations. The workgroup provides considerations when using report vendors, emphasizing the clinical laboratory's role and responsibility when implementing such reporting tools from vendors.Clinical laboratories should be familiar with the fundamentals of PGx, ensure that PGx testing meets the applicable regulatory requirements for all aspects of the clinical laboratory testing process, and follow recommendations for standardization of nomenclature and reporting.© 2025 College of American Pathologists.",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,"Nov 22, 2025",2025,Nov,22,Ji Y|Brunk L|Bove B|Danyal K|Langman L J|Mot N|Mroz P|Natowicz M|Reddi H|Shirts B|Smock K|Wool G D|Zhang B M|Moyer A M,Langman L J|Moyer A M,"From the Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City (Ji, Smock).|Proficiency Testing, College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois (Brunk, Mot).|self-employed, consultant LDT/PGx, Wilmington, Delaware (Bove).|the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington (Danyal).|the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (Langman, Moyer).|the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (Mroz).|Division of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (Natowicz).|Clinical Operations, Belay Diagnostics, Chicago, Illinois (Reddi).|the Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee (Shirts).|the Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois (Wool).|the Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California (Zhang).","Ji Y, Brunk L, Bove B, Danyal K, Langman L J, Mot N, Mroz P, Natowicz M, Reddi H, Shirts B, Smock K, Wool G D, Zhang B M, Moyer A M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41270809/,"This research provides guidance for clinical laboratories on implementing pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, which can help personalize medication treatment.

41213283,"Global, regional, and national burden of chronic kidney disease in adults, 1990-2023, and its attributable risk factors: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and ranks among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. This analysis aimed to present global CKD estimates using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to inform evidence-based policies for CKD identification and treatment.This analysis focused on adults aged 20 years and older over the period 1990 to 2023, from 204 countries and territories. Data sources used were published literature, vital registration systems, kidney failure treatment registries, and household surveys. Estimates of CKD burden, including deaths, incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), were produced using a Cause of Death Ensemble model and a Bayesian meta-regression analytical tool. A comparative risk assessment approach estimated the proportion of cardiovascular deaths attributable to impaired kidney function and estimated risk factors for CKD.Globally, in 2023, 788 million (95% uncertainty interval 743-843) people aged 20 years and older were estimated to have CKD, up from 378 million (354-407) in 1990. The global age-standardised prevalence of CKD in adults was 14·2% (13·4-15·2), a relative rise of 3·5% (2·7-4·1) from 1990. The region with the highest age-standardised prevalence was north Africa and the Middle East (18·0%; 16·9-19·4). Most people had stage 1-3 CKD, with a combined prevalence of 13·9% (13·1-15·0). In 2023, CKD was the ninth leading cause of death globally, accounting for 1·48 million (1·30-1·65) deaths, and the 12th leading cause of DALYs, with an age-standardised DALY rate of 769·2 (691·8-857·4) per 100 000. Impaired kidney function as a risk factor accounted for 11·5% (8·4-14·5) of cardiovascular deaths. High fasting plasma glucose, body-mass index, and systolic blood pressure were all leading risk factors for CKD DALYs.CKD is a major global health issue, with rising prevalence and increasing importance as a cause of death and as a risk factor for cardiovascular death. A better understating of aetiology, appropriate screening, and implementation programmes are needed to translate advances in CKD treatment into improved patient outcomes.Gates Foundation, Wellcome, US National Kidney Foundation, and US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).
