41138264,Evaluating a calcium chloride-elastase combination for creating large aneurysms in the endovascular rabbit elastase model.,"PurposeLarge aneurysms have a higher rupture risk, yet no available in vivo animal model consistently produces large aneurysms for testing endovascular therapies. Recent research suggests that adding calcium chloride (CaCl2) to elastase yields larger aneurysms in a surgical rabbit model. We evaluated whether this effect translates to an endovascular approach by comparing aneurysm sizes created using elastase alone versus a CaCl2-elastase combination.MethodsAneurysms were created in the right common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. One group received 1 mL porcine elastase; the other received elastase plus 0.055 g CaCl2 (0.5 M). After four weeks, patency was confirmed via digital subtraction angiography. Two blinded co-authors measured the neck, width, and height of the aneurysms. Aneurysm volumes were estimated using AngioCalc.com. Statistical analyses were performed using either the Mann-Whitney U-test or t-test based on data distribution.ResultsTwenty-nine (29) New Zealand rabbits were included in the study: six in the CaCl2 and elastase groups, 23 in the elastase-alone group. All induced aneurysms remained patent at follow-up. Mean neck size was significantly larger in the CaCl2 + elastase group than in the elastase-alone group (4.4 ± 1.1 mm vs 3.5 ± 0.95 mm; respectively, p = 0.02). Differences in width (4.1 ± 0.92 mm vs 3.4 ± 0.36 mm; p = 0.06), height (9.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 9.1 ± 2.1 mm; p = 0.46), and volume (83.5 ± 38.35 mm³ vs 53.0 ± 16.94 mm³; p = 0.11) were not significant between CaCl2 + elastase and elastase-alone, respectively.ConclusionsCaCl2 modestly increased neck size but did not significantly enlarge overall aneurysm dimensions.

Aneurysms are weakened areas in blood vessel walls that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. Larger aneurysms are at higher risk of rupturing, but current animal models struggle to consistently produce large aneurysms for testing. 

The researchers tried a new approach, injecting a combination of the enzyme elastase and the chemical calcium chloride into the carotid arteries of rabbits to induce aneurysm formation. They compared this to using elastase alone. After four weeks, they found that the calcium chloride-elastase combination did slightly increase the size of the aneurysm necks, but did not significantly enlarge the overall aneurysm dimensions compared to elastase alone. 

While the new method did not dramatically improve aneurysm size, this research provides valuable insights for developing better animal models to study aneurysms and test new treatments. Further studies are needed, but this work represents an important step towards creating more realistic and clinically relevant aneurysm models to ultimately improve care for patients at risk of this dangerous condition."
41137661,A comprehensive review of aneurysm clip materials and artifact reduction techniques.,"High-resolution imaging is critical for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and postoperative monitoring of cerebral aneurysms, which affect up to 5% of the population and pose a significant risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Surgical clipping remains a definitive treatment option, but metallic clips can introduce substantial imaging artifacts, complicating posttreatment assessment. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impact of aneurysm clip materials and designs on artifact generation and explores strategies for artifact mitigation. Conventional materials like titanium are favored for their biocompatibility and reduced ferromagnetism but still cause beam hardening, streak artifacts, and signal loss in CT and MRI scans. Emerging alternatives, including ceramics, composites, polymers, and bioresorbable clips, show promise in reducing artifacts while maintaining mechanical reliability. Innovations in clip design, such as fenestrated or low-profile models, further aid in minimizing imaging distortion. Advanced imaging methods, including dual-energy CT, iterative reconstruction algorithms, and metal artifact reduction software, demonstrate significant improvements in image quality but may introduce limitations such as increased processing demands or subtle anatomical distortions. Future directions emphasize the development of next-generation clip materials, robotic-assisted surgical approaches, and artificial intelligence-driven reconstruction techniques to further optimize visualization and patient safety.

41136681,Splicing Factor Mutations in Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia: Biological Consequences and Therapeutic Implications.,"This review will summarize recent research into the diverse biological consequences of splicing factor mutations, and possible therapeutic vulnerabilities uncovered by such mutations, with a dedicated focus on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.Splicing factor mutations dysregulate alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. The global nature of such dysregulation has pleiotropic effects on cellular function. Splicing factor mutations can alter NF-κβ and IFN-γ signaling, alter malignant hematopoietic cell differentiation, degrade the function of epigenetic complexes, and predispose cells to DNA replicative stress. Therapeutic strategies to target the altered biology of clones harboring splicing mutations have had varying degrees of success. Because splicing factor mutations are highly prevalent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and many other hematologic malignancies, an understanding of their downstream effects and therapeutic vulnerabilities is of key interest in the field. This review highlights recent developments and opportunities for targeted therapies.© 2025.

CMML is a rare and aggressive form of cancer that affects the production of certain white blood cells. The researchers focused on mutations in genes that control how the body's cells process and use genetic information, a process called ""splicing."" 

The study reviewed recent scientific findings on how these splicing factor mutations can disrupt normal cell function and contribute to the development of CMML. The researchers found that splicing factor mutations can have widespread effects, altering important cellular processes like inflammation, cell differentiation, and DNA replication. Understanding these biological consequences is crucial, as it may reveal new ways to target and treat CMML tumors harboring these genetic changes.

While some experimental therapies targeting splicing factor mutations have shown promise, the researchers note that more work is needed to translate these findings into effective clinical treatments. Nonetheless, this review highlights an important area of cancer research that could lead to improved outcomes for patients with CMML and other blood cancers characterized by splicing factor mutations. Continued investigation into the complex effects of these genetic changes may uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited to develop more personalized and effective therapies."
41137834,Comparative Outcomes of Intracardiac vs Transesophageal Echocardiographic Guidance for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion: Insights From EMERGE LAA Postapproval Study.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is commonly used to guide left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedures. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is emerging as an alternative imaging modality with potential advantages over TEE.The aim of this study was to compare outcomes from procedures guided by ICE vs TEE vs both for guidance of Amulet implantation in the EMERGE LAA postapproval study.Patients with Amulet implants entered into the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO Registry between August 14, 2021, and December 15, 2023. A safety composite endpoint of all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention through 7 days or hospital discharge was reported. Major adverse events were also reported through 45 days.A total of 11,848 patients were included in this analysis, with 433 (3.7%) using ICE only, 9,793 (82.6%) TEE only, and 1,622 (13.7%) ICE plus TEE. Median follow-up duration was the same in all groups (45.0 days; Q1-Q3: 45.0-45.0 days). Baseline characteristics were comparable across all groups. Similar rates of implantation success (ICE, 95.0%; TEE, 96.1%; ICE plus TEE, 96.2%; P = 0.324) and clinically relevant closure (≤3-mm peridevice leak) at 45 days (>95% for all groups) were observed. Procedural times were longer in the ICE (104.8 ± 44.7 minutes; median 98.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 78.0-122.0 minutes) and ICE plus TEE (98.8 ± 46.6 minutes; median 88.5 minutes; Q1-Q3: 71.0-116.0 minutes) groups compared with the TEE group (82.0 ± 39.2 minutes; median 75.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 57.0-99.0 minutes) (P < 0.001). The safety composite endpoint (ICE, 0.9% [4 of 433]; TEE, 0.9% [93 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 0.7% [11 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.36-2.66]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.43-4.31]; P = 0.585) and 45-day major adverse event composite (ICE, 7.1% [30 of 433]; TEE, 6.7% [651 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 5.7% [93 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 1.08 [95% CI: 0.75-1.57]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.27 [95% CI: 0.83-1.93]; P = 0.336) were similar between imaging groups. Procedural times and adverse event rates decreased as operator experience increased in the ICE groups.In the largest comparison to date, both ICE and TEE are safe and effective for Amulet LAAO guidance, with high acute success and closure rates. ICE was associated with longer procedure times that decreased with operator experience, potentially reflecting a learning curve.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

LAAO is done to prevent blood clots from forming in a small pouch in the heart, which can reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. 

The researchers looked at data from over 11,000 LAAO procedures, where some used intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) to guide the procedure, some used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and some used a combination of both. They found that both ICE and TEE were equally safe and effective, with high rates of successful device implantation and closure of the left atrial appendage. However, procedures using ICE alone or in combination with TEE took longer on average than those using TEE alone. This may be due to a learning curve, as ICE is a newer technology. Overall, the study shows that ICE is a viable alternative to the more commonly used TEE for guiding LAAO, which could expand access to this important stroke prevention procedure. The findings are reassuring for patients considering LAAO, as the choice of imaging guidance does not appear to significantly impact the safety or effectiveness of the procedure."
41134872,BMDD: A probabilistic framework for accurate imputation of zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data.,"Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.Copyright: © 2025 Zhou et al.

However, analyzing microbiome data poses challenges because it often contains many ""zero"" values, representing microbes that were not detected. This makes it difficult to accurately measure and compare microbial abundances, which is essential for identifying potential disease biomarkers or understanding how the microbiome interacts with the human body. 

In this study, the researchers developed a new statistical model called BMDD that can accurately ""impute"" or estimate the true abundances of microbes, even when their levels are very low or undetected. Unlike previous methods, BMDD recognizes that microbiome data often has a bimodal distribution, with one peak representing microbes that are truly absent and another for those present at low levels. By modeling this bimodal pattern, BMDD can more precisely reconstruct the original microbial abundances. The researchers demonstrated through simulations and real-world datasets that BMDD outperforms existing imputation approaches, leading to improved detection of differences in microbial communities between health and disease states. This advance in microbiome data analysis has important implications for accelerating the discovery of microbial biomarkers and understanding how the microbiome influences human physiology and disease."
41133348,MR Elastography-Based Slip Interface Imaging for Assessment of Myofascial Interface Mobility in Chronic Low Back Pain: A Pilot Study.,"Abnormal restrictions at myofascial interfaces are a key factor in chronic low back pain (CLBP) with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), but no established imaging method exists for quantitative assessment. This pilot study evaluated the clinical feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) for visualizing myofascial mobility in CLBP-MPS patients versus age-/sex-/BMI-matched healthy participants. A new SII biomarker, maximal normalized displacement discontinuity (   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  ), was introduced, and the previously developed normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) map was used for comparison. Preliminary assessments of vibration-frequency effects, repeatability, and group differences in inter-muscular mobility were conducted.MRE was conducted at 30, 60, and 90 Hz to compare   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  with NOSS for visualizing inter-muscular slip interfaces at the quadratus lumborum-erector spinae (QL-ES) and erector spinae-multifidus (ES-M) muscle boundaries at L3-L4. Repeatability of   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  and NOSS was assessed at 30 Hz (identified as the best-performing frequency) using within-subject coefficients of variation and a linear mixed-effects model from within- and between-day scans. Clinical feasibility was then assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests in six CLBP-MPS patients and matched controls.D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  at 30 Hz exhibited superior delineation of slip interfaces compared to higher frequencies and NOSS.   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  demonstrated significantly lower variation and better repeatability than NOSS. Healthy participants showed continuous, well-defined slip interfaces, whereas CLBP-MPS patients displayed disrupted interfaces with significant mobility reduction at L4 ES-M.SII with lower vibration frequency and   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  map enhances visualization of lower back myofascial mobility and shows potential for assessing differences between healthy individuals and CLBP-MPS patients.© 2025 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",Magnetic resonance in medicine,"Oct 24, 2025",2025,Oct,24,Hojo E|Sui Y|Shan X|Zheng K|Rossman P|Waters T|Manduca A|Powell G M|An K|Ehman R L|Nanda S|Chon T Y|Bauer B A|Yin Z,Hojo E|Sui Y|Shan X|Zheng K|Rossman P|Waters T|Manduca A|Powell G M|An K|Ehman R L|Nanda S|Chon T Y|Bauer B A|Yin Z,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Orthopedics Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Hojo E, Sui Y, Shan X, Zheng K, Rossman P, Waters T, Manduca A, Powell G M, An K, Ehman R L, Nanda S, Chon T Y, Bauer B A, Yin Z",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41133348/,"This medical research study explored a new imaging technique called MR elastography (MRE) to assess mobility at the interfaces between muscles in the lower back.

41133522,Risk stratification and early intervention in smoldering multiple myeloma.,"Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a biologically diverse precursor to multiple myeloma (MM), characterized by varying risks of progression. Several validated risk stratification models help identify patients at the highest risk, who may benefit from early treatment at the precursor stage. Current guidelines recommend treatment with lenalidomide, with or without dexamethasone, or participation in clinical trials for patients with high-risk SMM. Recent data also support using daratumumab monotherapy, which has been shown to significantly delay progression to MM. However, uncertainties remain about the long-term benefits of early intervention, especially regarding its effects on overall survival, quality of life, and the risk-benefit ratio in this asymptomatic group.

41134013,Parameters Associated With Renal Recovery and Survival in Myeloma Patients With Acute Renal Failure to Cast Nephropathy.,"Acute renal failure due to cast nephropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we aimed to identify parameters associated with renal outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM patients with CAN-related acute renal failure and to validate the IMWG criteria for renal response. CAN diagnosis was based on biopsy or clinical assessment. Of 787 registered patients, 354 met the inclusion criteria, requiring at least two therapy cycles with documented chemotherapy response, renal response, and eGFR. Baseline free light chain (FLC) levels (median 6825.65 mg/L) decreased below 500 mg/L in 67.8% of patients. According to IMWG classification, renal complete response, partial response, and minimal response were achieved in 33.9%, 19.5%, and 28.0% of patients, respectively. The best eGFR values > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 33.9% of patients, while 33.3%, 22.3%, and 10.5% had best eGFR values of 30-59, 15-29, and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Renal response correlated with baseline FLC levels, IgG kappa, eGFR, and ECOG status in multivariate analysis, as well as with myeloma response and FLC reduction in univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 77.6 months. Survival correlated with age, myeloma response, ECOG status, FLC kappa type, baseline eGFR, standard-risk cytogenetics, and calcium levels, among other factors. A comparison of IMWG renal response criteria with classification based solely on best eGFR showed similar utility. Of 136 patients requiring dialysis, 80 (58.8%) were able to discontinue dialysis during therapy. Bortezomib containing myeloma therapy, along with significant FLC reduction, was associated with favorable outcome.© 2025 The Author(s).

The researchers analyzed data from 354 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with cast nephropathy-related kidney failure. They found that patients who were able to significantly reduce the levels of these abnormal proteins in their blood were more likely to see improvement in their kidney function. Factors like the patient's overall health, the type of myeloma, and the response to cancer treatment also played a role in kidney recovery and survival. Importantly, the researchers validated the usefulness of the standard guidelines for assessing kidney recovery in these patients. The findings suggest that aggressive treatment to rapidly lower the abnormal protein levels, along with supportive care, can help many multiple myeloma patients with kidney failure regain normal or near-normal kidney function. This knowledge can guide healthcare providers in managing this serious complication and improve outcomes for patients with this challenging condition."
41134301,Assessing Risk of Progression in Barrett's Esophagus Using a Mass-Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Panel.,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a critical precursor of EAC. Patients with BE undergo endoscopic surveillance to monitor disease progression even though only a small fraction develop EAC. These procedures are invasive and have limited accuracy in predicting BE progression. We evaluated the utility of an 8-protein mass spectrometry panel in predicting progression in patients with BE.Eighty untreated controls and 20 cases were selected from our institutional tissue registry. Quantitative mass-spectrometry was performed on micro-dissected tissue sections. Data were split into 80% training and 20% test sets. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized (LASSO) regression to train a logistic classifier on training data. Classifier performance was evaluated in test data.Ninety-two samples had sufficient tissue for mass spectrometry analysis (18 progressors, 74 non-progressors). The multivariable regression model produced a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 39% in the overall cohort, with AUCs of 0.75 and 0.89 in the overall and test cohorts, respectively. Cox proportional hazards time-to-progression (TTP) showed a hazard ratio of 66.1 (95% CI 7.79-561, p=0.00012) for the model prediction.The promising performance of the model generated here suggests that the test may aid in selecting patients most likely to benefit from active BE surveillance.

Barrett's esophagus is a precursor condition that can lead to esophageal cancer, but not everyone with Barrett's will develop cancer. Currently, patients with Barrett's undergo regular endoscopies to monitor for signs of cancer, but these procedures are invasive and not always accurate in predicting who will progress to cancer. 

In this study, researchers evaluated a new test that uses mass spectrometry to analyze a panel of 8 proteins in tissue samples from patients with Barrett's esophagus. They found that this proteomic test was able to accurately identify patients who were more likely to progress to esophageal cancer, with high sensitivity and moderate specificity. The test results were also strongly associated with the time it took for patients to progress to cancer. 

These findings suggest that this proteomic panel could be a useful tool to help doctors better identify which Barrett's esophagus patients are at highest risk of developing cancer. This could allow for more targeted and effective monitoring and treatment, potentially improving outcomes for patients. However, further research is still needed to validate the test in larger patient populations before it could be widely adopted in clinical practice."

41134675,Compromised pressure-generating capacity of diaphragmatic muscle and its interaction with the lower rib cage at high lung volume during airway occlusion.,"The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm is generally thought to be compromised at high lung volume either due to loss of curvature or loss of its membrane tension. At a state of hyperinflation during airway occlusion at total lung capacity, the diaphragmatic muscle is forced to contract from an initial shorter length, the zone of apposition narrows, insertional force on the chest wall is reduced and abdominal compliance falls. We hypothesize that these altered mechanical conditions at high lung volume lead to a loss of the pressure generating capacity that is mediated by excessive muscle shortening rather than loss of curvature of its muscle fibers. . Using a biplane fluoroscopy, locations of radiopaque markers attached to the diaphragm muscle fibers and the lower three ribs of 10 beagle dogs weighing between 7kg to 10.5 kg were determined. Such measurements were conducted during quiet spontaneous breathing and during forceful inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway at three lung volumes spanning the vital capacity from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). Our data show that transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) at TLC was reduced by nearly 80% and surface area of the midcostal diaphragm muscle at contracted state during airway occlusion at TLC reduced by nearly 35% from its value at end of expiration. In addition, muscle fiber curvature were essentially maintained during the entire vital capacity of airway occlusion. Our data demonstrate that during airway occlusion at high lung volume, the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm is compromised primarily due to a mechanism that involved a combined mechanical effect of hyperinflation and excessive muscle contraction rather than a significant loss of curvature of its muscle fibers.","American journal of physiology.

The diaphragm plays a crucial role in generating the pressure needed for breathing, but its ability to do so may be compromised when the lungs are very full, such as in conditions like emphysema. 

The researchers used imaging techniques to track the movement and shape of the diaphragm in dogs as they breathed against a blocked airway at different lung volumes. They found that at high lung volumes, the diaphragm generated much less pressure - up to 80% less - compared to normal breathing. This was not due to changes in the curvature of the diaphragm muscle fibers, as had been previously thought. Instead, the reduced pressure was caused by a combination of the diaphragm having to contract from a shorter starting length and the lower chest wall becoming stiffer, limiting the diaphragm's ability to move and generate force.

These findings help explain why people with lung diseases that cause air trapping and hyperinflation often struggle to breathe. Understanding the specific mechanical factors that limit diaphragm function in these conditions could lead to better treatments or breathing support strategies to improve quality of life for patients. However, further research is needed to confirm these results in humans and explore potential clinical applications."

Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter waste and excess fluid from the blood, allowing patients to receive treatment at home. 

The researchers reviewed existing evidence on sex-related factors that may impact the success and safety of peritoneal dialysis. They found that women tend to have a higher risk of certain complications, like peritonitis (infection of the peritoneum), compared to men. However, the reasons for these differences are not well understood. The researchers call for future studies to investigate the underlying biological and social factors that contribute to sex disparities in peritoneal dialysis outcomes.

Importantly, the researchers note that more research is needed to fully characterize these sex-related differences, including how they may impact patients' quality of life and overall health. By better understanding the unique needs of men and women on peritoneal dialysis, healthcare providers can work to optimize treatment and ensure equitable, high-quality care for all patients. Addressing these sex-based differences could lead to improved outcomes and quality of life for the many individuals worldwide who rely on peritoneal dialysis to manage their kidney disease."
41135121,Outcomes of distal sternocleidomastoid stump resection following selective denervation as revision surgery in refractory cervical dystonia.,"Cervical dystonia (or spasmodic torticollis) is a neurological condition that results in abnormal movements and head posture, for which initial surgical intervention typically involves selective denervation of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and paraspinal muscles. However, muscle reactivation of the distal SCM stump can result in recurrent symptoms. In this study, the authors present their preliminary experience with distal SCM stump resection following selective denervation, with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the procedure and identifying patients who may benefit from this technique.This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients who underwent SCM stump resection as revision surgery for cervical dystonia.A total of 18 patients (10 males [56%]) were included with a median (range) age of 54 (40-70) years. All patients received selective denervation of the SCM at the authors' institution prior to SCM stump resection at a median (range) time of 12 (3-198) months between surgical procedures. At preoperative baseline, 13 patients (72%) possessed a rotational torticollis component to their head deviation, 12 (67%) possessed a laterocollis component, and 2 (11%) possessed a retrocollis component. At the most recent follow-up (median [range] 16 [4-119] months), 6 patients had complete resolution of their cervical dystonia (33%), while 10 had residual deviation (56%) and 2 had recurrent deviation (11%). However, compared to their post-selective denervation head position, 12 patients experienced improvement in their head position (67%), 4 patients had no change in their head position (22%), and 2 had worsening of their cervical dystonia (11%) following SCM stump resection. Importantly, 12 patients experienced improvement in their pain following SCM stump resection (67%). Patients who had a history of other movement/spasmodic disorders were more likely to have improvement in head position and improvement in pain after SCM stump resection, though neither of these results achieved statistical significance (p = 0.054). Additionally, patients who experienced full resolution of their cervical dystonia had shorter time between initial selective denervation surgery and SCM stump resection, though this result also did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.068).Distal SCM stump resection following selective denervation is a simple, safe, and effective option for many patients in treating refractory cervical dystonia.

This can be very disabling and painful for patients. Doctors often try to treat it with a surgery called selective denervation, which involves cutting certain nerves to relax the affected muscles. However, in some cases the symptoms can return as the cut nerve endings regrow and reactivate the muscles. 

In this study, the researchers looked at a follow-up surgery where they removed the regrown nerve endings, called the distal stump of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. They reviewed the outcomes for 18 patients who had this additional surgery after their initial selective denervation procedure. They found that two-thirds of patients experienced improvement in their head position and reduction in pain after the SCM stump removal. Patients with a history of other movement disorders seemed to benefit the most. While not all patients had complete resolution of their cervical dystonia, the procedure was generally safe and effective at reducing the recurrent symptoms for many.

This suggests that removing the regrown nerve endings can be a useful option for patients whose cervical dystonia symptoms return after the initial selective denervation surgery. It provides an additional tool for managing this challenging neurological condition and improving quality of life for affected individuals. Further research is still needed, but this study offers promising preliminary results."
41136333,Vessel Wall Imaging at 7T: State of the Art.,"Intracranial vessel wall imaging (VWI) has emerged as a critical tool in neurovascular diagnostics, enabling direct assessment of the vessel wall, which conventional luminal imaging techniques cannot fully address. While commonly available 3T MRI systems have been valuable for VWI, limitations in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio hinder their ability to visualize medium and smaller caliber vessels. Ultra-high-field 7T-MRI, given its improved spatial resolution, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio, can help address these limitations. This review highlights the historical development of VWI at 7T, tracing its evolution from early attempts to key technical advancements, development of pulse sequences such as MPIR-TSE, SPACE, and CUBE, along with the later incorporation of CSF suppression techniques to further enhance lesion conspicuity. It also discusses the pitfalls and clinical applications of 7T-VWI in cerebrovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and aneurysms, demonstrating its ability to improve plaque characterization, monitor disease progression, and assist in treatment planning. Despite challenges, such as B1 field inhomogeneity and the lack of standardized protocols, 7T-MRI's potential for clinical application is evident, with ongoing innovations like deep learning-based reconstructions promising to further improve its feasibility in routine clinical practice.ABBREVIATIONS: VWI＝ Vessel Wall Imaging; CoW＝ Circle of Willis; MPIR-TSE＝ magnetization-prepared inversion recovery turbo spin echo; SNR＝ Signal-to-noise ratio; CNR＝ Contrast-to-noise ratio; SPACE＝ Sampling Perfection with Application-optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolutions; DANTE＝ Delay Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation; ICAD＝ Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease; UIA＝ Unruptured intracranial aneurysm.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41136334,The Incidence of Calcified Pituitary Macroadenomas: Challenging the Craniopharyngioma Assumption.,"Large sellar/suprasellar masses containing calcifications are classically associated with craniopharyngiomas. In our practice, however, we have noticed that some giant pituitary macroadenomas have calcifications. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of calcifications in pituitary macroadenomas.We reviewed an internal database for pathology proven giant macroadenomas (>4 cm). Basic patient demographics were collected, including age and sex. Adenoma subtype and maximum adenoma dimension were recorded. Preoperative CT images were reviewed for capsular (none, thin, coarse, or mixed) and internal calcifications (none, thin, coarse, or mixed). Pre-operative MRI images were also reviewed to further characterize the adenoma (solid, cystic, and mixed; T1 signal).45 macroadenomas were included. The mean size was 47.4 mm (SD: 6.2, Range: 40-70). 44.4% (95% CI 30.9-58.8%) of macroadenomas (20/45) had surrounding calcification. 10 (22%, 95% CI 12.5-36.3%) were from the expanded or destroyed dorsum sella, not the adenoma. 10 (22%, 95% CI 12.5-36.3%) cases had calcification directly from the adenoma. No cases had internal calcification. All were thin capsular calcification: 6 were thin, 3 were coarse, and 1 was mixed.Large sellar/suprasellar masses that contain calcification are classically associated with craniopharyngiomas.

These are large, noncancerous growths that develop in the pituitary gland, a small hormone-producing gland at the base of the brain. Pituitary macroadenomas are usually associated with symptoms like headaches, vision problems, and hormone imbalances.

The researchers reviewed medical records and imaging scans of 45 patients with giant pituitary macroadenomas, defined as tumors larger than 4 cm. They found that 44% of these large tumors had calcifications, or hardened deposits, around the outside of the tumor. Surprisingly, 22% of the calcifications were actually located in the bone around the tumor, not within the tumor itself. Only 22% of the calcifications were directly within the tumor.

This challenges the common assumption that calcifications in large brain tumors are a clear sign of a different type of tumor called a craniopharyngioma. The findings suggest that calcifications can also occur in some pituitary macroadenomas, which could impact how these tumors are diagnosed and treated. Further research is needed, but this study provides important new insights into the characteristics of these relatively common brain tumors. Understanding the prevalence of calcifications in pituitary macroadenomas could help improve diagnosis and treatment for patients affected by these conditions."
41136378,CHFR expression and sensitivity of breast cancer cells to antimitotic agents in vitro and in the I-SPY trial.,"CHFR, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously implicated in regulating the premitotic checkpoint and response to taxanes, is silenced in a subset of breast cancers. Here we assessed the impact of differences in CHFR expression on sensitivity to various antimitotic agents in vitro and on response to neoadjuvant taxane treatment in the clinical setting. Colony forming assays as well as live cell imaging in human breast cancer cell lines indicated that CHFR downregulation is associated with increased sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors as well as paclitaxel in vitro that reflects premature mitotic exit and increased multinucleation. To assess the relationship between CHFR expression and neoadjuvant taxane response, we utilized immunohistochemistry to examine CHFR expression in the inter-regimen biopsy from 81 patients on the I-SPY neoadjuvant breast cancer trial (NCT01042379) who had dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRIs before and after paclitaxel monotherapy. CHFRLow cancers had indistinguishable volumes before taxane therapy but smaller MRI tumor volumes after paclitaxel [median 0.07 cm3 (interquartile range 0-1.1) in CHFRLow versus 1.1 cm3 (0.02-5.0) in CHFRHigh cancers, p = 0.03 by rank sum test]. Moreover, there was a strong association between higher CHFR expression and lower relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative cancers (HR 7.8, p = 0.024). These observations identify CHFR as a potential predictive marker of sensitivity in ER positive breast cancer that warrants further investigation and suggest that CHFR might also be associated with response to certain other mitotic inhibitors.© 2025.

Through lab experiments on breast cancer cell lines, the researchers found that breast cancer cells with low CHFR levels were more sensitive to certain antimitotic drugs, like paclitaxel and PLK1 inhibitors. They then looked at data from a clinical trial, where they measured CHFR levels in breast tumors before and after patients received paclitaxel chemotherapy. They found that tumors with low CHFR levels shrank more in response to paclitaxel treatment compared to tumors with high CHFR.

Data were collected in a research unit.Eligible participants were ≥ 4 years old, not pregnant, with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≥20 ng/mL and normal serum calcium.Participants were treated with calcitriol, with dose based on serum and urinary calcium concentrations, for 1 year.The primary endpoints were change in serum phosphate and nephrocalcinosis (all participants) and rickets severity score (children). Secondary endpoints included changes in additional markers of mineral metabolism, skeletal microarchitecture parameters via high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (all participants), and height z-scores (children).Serum phosphate did not change over 12 months of optimized calcitriol treatment. Rickets improved in 2 of 4 children with open epiphyses; height z-scores were unchanged. Nephrocalcinosis scores remained stable. Adults had increased cortical thickness at the radius diaphysis (p=0.012).

XLH causes low levels of phosphate in the blood, leading to problems with bone and muscle development. The researchers followed a group of XLH patients for one year as they took calcitriol, a form of vitamin D, to see if it could improve their condition without causing side effects.

The results showed that calcitriol helped stabilize some markers of mineral metabolism and bone health, like reducing high levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in children. However, it did not significantly raise phosphate levels or improve the severity of rickets (softening of the bones) in children. In adults, calcitriol increased the thickness of the cortical bone (the dense outer layer) in the forearm. Overall, the treatment was well-tolerated, though a few participants developed mild high calcium levels that were managed by adjusting the calcitriol dose. 

This study suggests that calcitriol alone may have modest benefits for some aspects of XLH, but it is not a cure-all. More research is needed to find better treatments to fully address the complex skeletal and metabolic issues caused by this genetic disorder. However, this work provides important insights that could help improve care and quality of life for XLH patients."

Meta-analyses were performed using R software, applying random effects models to calculate prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroups of surgery and embolization were compared using Chi-squared test. The quality of the studies was assessed using appropriate checklists.""Fifteen studies involving 321 patients and 354 CVFs were included, all of good quality. Both treatment modalities led to over 90% partial or complete headache response, with no significant difference between embolization (93.9%; 95% CI: 88.3% to 96.9%) and surgery (90.1%; 95% CI: 75.6% to 96.4%) (P = .43). Overall symptom resolution (complete response) was also comparable between embolization (59.1%; 95% CI: 50.5% to 67.1%) and surgery (70.7%; 95% CI: 44.7% to 87.8%) (P = .38). Radiologic response, measured by the Bern score, showed significant improvement postembolization, with no corresponding data from surgical literature. The retreatment/recurrence rate was 14% (95% CI: 9.9% to 19.3%), with no significant difference between embolization (15.3%; 95% CI: 10.3% to 22.1%) and surgery (11.3%; 95% CI: 5.7% to 20.9%) (P = .63). There was no publication bias among the reported end points.Lack of direct comparative effectiveness and small sample sizes heighten the risk of selection and confounding bias.Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both surgical treatment and transvenous embolization for CVFs in patients with SIH provide comparable efficacy and safety profiles. Future research should employ uniform definitions, standardized radiologic and clinical end points, and long-term follow-up to more rigorously evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of these approaches.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

This study looked at two ways to treat a specific cause of this condition - cerebrospinal fluid leaks into the veins (called CSF-venous fistulas). The researchers reviewed past studies comparing surgical treatment to a less invasive procedure called transvenous embolization, which blocks the leaks. They found that both treatments were effective at relieving headaches and other symptoms in over 90% of patients. The overall success rates were similar between the two approaches, with no major differences in safety or complication rates. While the surgical option had slightly higher complete symptom resolution, the embolization procedure showed better improvements on imaging tests. This suggests both are viable options, and the choice may depend on the individual patient's circumstances and preferences. Limitations include the small number of studies and patients involved, which makes it hard to fully compare the two treatments. But this review provides helpful guidance for doctors and patients considering the best way to address this challenging condition."
41134930,Brachial Plexus Injuries Associated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation : A Report of 3 Cases.,"We present 3 cases of brachial plexus injuries (BPI) secondary to compressive hematomas during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with follow-up ranging from 18 months to 12 years. Patients exhibited profound upper extremity deficits and underwent variable interventions, including surgical decompression. All demonstrated meaningful neurologic recovery.BPI is a rare but serious complication of ECMO. These cases highlight the importance of early recognition and hematoma evacuation, emphasizing the need for clinical vigilance to optimize neurologic outcomes following hematoma-induced nerve injury.Copyright © 2025 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",JBJS case connector,"Oct 01, 2025",2025,Oct,01,Peairs E M|Spinner R J|Shin A Y,Peairs E M|Spinner R J|Shin A Y,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester Minnesota.|Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester Minnesota.","Peairs E M, Spinner R J, Shin A Y",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41134930/,"This research study examined a rare but serious complication that can occur in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - a life-saving treatment that uses a machine to oxygenate the blood outside the body. The researchers looked at three cases where patients developed brachial plexus injuries (BPI), which are injuries to the network of nerves that control the arm and hand. These injuries were caused by compression from blood clots that formed around the ECMO tubing. The patients experienced significant weakness and loss of function in their affected arms. The researchers followed these patients for up to 12 years and found that while the injuries were severe, the patients were able to regain meaningful neurological recovery, often requiring surgical intervention to remove the compressive blood clots. This study highlights the importance of closely monitoring ECMO patients for signs of BPI, as early recognition and treatment is crucial to optimizing outcomes for these patients. While ECMO can be a lifesaving therapy, this research underscores the need for healthcare providers to remain vigilant for potential complications and act quickly to minimize long-term nerve damage."
