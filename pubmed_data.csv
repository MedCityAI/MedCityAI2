40960253,A Randomized Trial of Shunting for Idiopathic Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a neurologic disorder characterized by impaired gait, balance, cognition, and bladder control in older adults. The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of shunting is unclear.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, >400 mm of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence).A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt group (mean [±SD] change, 0.23±0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03±0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P<0.001). A significantly greater improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P = 0.003) but not the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%).Among participants with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or incontinence.

41060190,Adult Abdominal Photon-Counting CT Protocols: A Multiinstitutional Consensus of the Society of Abdominal Radiology Photon-Counting Detector CT Emerging Technology Commission.,"Photon-counting CT (PCCT) offers new opportunities for abdominal imaging by enabling higher spatial resolution, improved image quality, and reduced radiation exposure compared with conventional energy-integrating detector CT systems. However, standardized PCCT protocols for abdominal imaging are lacking, which limits clinical adoption, comparability across institutions, and multicenter research studies. The Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR) Photon-Counting Detector CT Emerging Technology Commission created a survey to achieve consensus on common adult abdominal PCCT protocols for FDA-approved PCCT, including portal venous phase CT, multiphase aortic CTA, and multiphase pancreas CT protocols. The survey included the following items for each protocol: scan mode, tube potential, image quality level, primary viewing virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) level, reconstruction kernel, additional VMI or other spectral reconstructions sent to PACS, and details of archiving the special spectral imaging dataset. Consensus statements were generated based on the survey and voted on by nine radiologists from nine institutions using the consensus-minus-one method. Consensus was reached for 20 protocol features, including that 70-keV VMI is recommended for primary interpretation of portal venous and multiphase pancreas PCCT and that, for multiphase aortic CTA, low virtual monoenergetic levels should be viewed. This multiinstitutional consensus endorsed by SAR establishes standardized abdominal PCCT protocols.",AJR.

41331355,Posterior rectus sheath hernia: a case series with emphasis on imaging findings.,"Posterior rectus sheath hernia (PRSH) is a rare interparietal hernia that is often undetected or misdiagnosed on imaging. We conducted a retrospective review of a case series to define the specific imaging findings and clinical features associated with these hernias.We retrospectively reviewed our institution's imaging and surgical databases to identify patients with PRSH. Cases meeting strict diagnostic criteria of focal defect of the posterior rectus sheath with herniation into the rectus sheath and without features of a lateral (Spigelian) hernia-were included. Clinical presentation, imaging modality, hernia contents, and management were recorded.Seven patients with PRSH were identified (five spontaneous, two post-surgical). Presentations ranged from incidental, asymptomatic findings to abdominal pain and gastrointestinal obstruction symptoms. Contrast-enhanced CT was the primary imaging modality. Hernia contents included omentum, properitoneal fat and small bowel. While most patients did not require operative intervention, one patient had incarcerated small bowel through a ~ 1 cm posterior sheath defect and required surgical repair.PRSH is a rare interparietal hernia that often goes undetected. Radiologists should evaluate the posterior rectus sheath on CT and MRI for presence of PRSH. Careful description of the rectus sheath defect and its contents-particularly bowel-can guide appropriate management and distinguish cases needing surgical referral from those managed nonoperatively.© 2025.

41332382,Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Excess Adiposity in Group 1 Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Although obesity and insulin resistance (IR) are established risk factors for left heart dysfunction, their clinical impact in group 1 pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains unclear. We sought to determine the impact of excess adiposity versus IR on biventricular hemodynamic and functional reserve in group 1 PH.Homeostasis model of insulin resistance and adiposity indices (body mass index [BMI], fat mass, waist circumference) were measured among group 1 patients with PH recruited to PVDOMICS. Functional capacity, and dynamic pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and right atrial pressure responses were compared stratified by obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) and IR status (HOMA-IR≥2.6) using repeated-measure mixed models.Among patients with group 1 PH (n=418), 158 (38%) had BMI≥30 kg/m2 (94 [60%] of whom had IR), and 260 (62%) had BMI<30 kg/m2 (74 [28%] of whom had IR). Among those with waist circumference measurement (n=375), 287 (77%) had excess adiposity by elevated waist/height ratio, with 214 (57%) having elevated waist circumference. Patients with obesity had worse quality of life, exercise capacity and left heart remodeling, along with higher resting/dynamic PCWP, right atrial pressure and cardiac output (P<0.0001 for all). Higher PCWP response with obesity persisted after adjusting for IR (IR-adjusted PCWP+2.5 mm Hg [95% CI, +1.4 to +3.6]; P<0.0001). All adiposity indices were consistently associated with PCWP response, but IR was not. Similar associations were observed between adiposity indices with higher right atrial pressure and cardiac output. Greater visceral adiposity as measured by body shape index (hazard ratio, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.16-3.47]; P=0.01) or weight-adjusted waist index (hazard ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.46]; P=0.01) was associated with worse survival.Excess adiposity is common in group 1 PH, occurring in 4 out of 5 patients by the more sensitive waist/height ratio, in contrast to only 2 out of 5 patients having obesity by traditional BMI criteria. Excess adiposity is associated with higher biventricular filling pressures, cardiac output demand, worse functional status and reduced survival. These data support trials of adipose-reducing therapies in patients with group 1 PH and excess adiposity.",Circulation.

41335275,Phase 1 dose escalation trial of the selective adenosine A2B antagonist PBF-1129 in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.,"The adenosinergic pathway represents a critical immunometabolic checkpoint within the tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), contributing to immune suppression and therapeutic resistance. PBF-1129, an oral, selective A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) antagonist, was evaluated in a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial (NCT03274479) in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC who had progressed on standard therapies. All patients had previously received chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade. Twenty-one patients received escalating doses (40-320 mg once daily), with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. The most frequently reported treatment related adverse events of any grade were lymphocytopenia (n = 8, 38.1%), vomiting (n = 8, 38.1%), anorexia (n = 6, 28.5%), and fatigue (n = 6, 28.5%). PBF-1129 showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and maintained plasma concentrations above the 90% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC90) of A2BAR at 320 mg for 24 h, which was determined to be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Best response was stable disease in 3 out of 21 patients including 2 of 6 treated at RP2D. Immunophenotyping revealed post-treatment reductions in programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on CD8⁺ T cells, which correlated with improved survival. The reduction of PD-1 expression on CD4⁺ T cells and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells were also associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest PBF-1129 is safe and modulates the systemic immune parameters, warranting further evaluation in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.© 2025.

All analyses were conducted in R software (version 4.4.2), employing the ""meta"" and ""tableone"" packages.64 studies with 9820 patients were included, large aneurysm size (OR=1.08, 95% CI (1.02, 1.14), P value=0.008), intra-aneurysmal thrombus (OR=1.05, 95% CI (1.01, 1.09), P value=0.010) and posterior circulation location (OR=1.02, 95% CI (1.00, 1.04), P value=0.014) were significant risk factors for DAR. The pooled prevalence of DAR was 1.40%, with a rate of 1.18% after removing outliers. DAR occurred within 30 days in 66.7% of cases, with a mortality rate of 73.3% at discharge.DAR following flow diversion treatment is an uncommon but devastating complication and remains a limitation of the technique. It is influenced by factors such as large aneurysm size, intra-aneurysmal thrombosis, and posterior circulation involvement. The first 30 days post-procedure represent a particularly high-risk period. Despite advancements in FD technology, significant gaps remain, highlighting the need for further research to improve risk assessment and treatment strategies.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41339076,Customer discovery in neurointervention: a practical primer for identifying unmet needs.,"Advancement in neurointervention is frequently driven by the introduction of new technology and devices that improve procedural efficacy and patient outcomes. For physician-innovators, customer discovery-or the process of directly engaging with end users to explore workflows and associated challenges-offers a structured way to identify meaningful problems and guide early innovation. This primer aims to outline stepwise guidance for conducting customer discovery within neurointervention to characterize key areas of unmet need.We detail stepwise guidance for conducting customer discovery founded on foundational business literature. To illustrate this process, we conducted five interviews with expert neurointerventionalists engaged in clinical innovation. Interview transcripts were reviewed and analyzed to track emerging themes, and responses were synthesized into a neurointerventionalist customer profile.Responses from interviewed neurointerventionalists suggested that safer vascular access, tools to support treatment prognostication, and condition-specific device design are unmet areas of need. Moreover, interviews revealed broader concerns about stagnation in device innovation and barriers within regulatory and institutional pathways.Structured customer discovery identifies unmet needs that may be overlooked when device development is solely driven by technical breakthroughs or published outcomes. By outlining an actionable framework for customer discovery in neurointervention, we provide a practical model for aligning future innovation with real-world clinical challenges.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.
