41289551,Patterns of Longitudinal Regional Brain Atrophy in Patients With Different Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Variants.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by progressive atrophy of brainstem, subcortical, and frontal regions. It is unknown whether longitudinal atrophy patterns differ between PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) and cortical and subcortical clinical variants of PSP and whether atrophy rates could be useful outcome measures for treatment trials. We aimed to determine whether regional rates of atrophy differ across PSP clinical variants and determine sample size estimates for clinical treatment trials.We identified participants with PSP-RS, PSP-cortical, or PSP-subcortical variants recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group who underwent 2 annual 3T MRI scans. Volumes were calculated for 10 regions of interest, and mixed-effects regression analysis was performed to compare annualized rates of atrophy across groups, accounting for confounders. Sample sizes required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials to detect a 20% treatment effect with 80% power were calculated for rates of atrophy and clinical metrics, including the PSP Rating Scale.Fifty patients with PSP-RS (baseline age = 69 [interquartile range 64 to 75], 46% female), 18 with PSP-cortical (74 [70 to 76], 50% female), 20 with PSP-subcortical (71 [67 to 77], 60% female), and 32 controls (69 [66 to 72], 72% female) were included. Rates of midbrain, cerebellar dentate, and subthalamic atrophy were greater in all PSP variants than in controls. The PSP-RS group showed greater midbrain atrophy rates than PSP-subcortical (-1.6% difference [95% CI -2.4 to -0.7], p < 0.001) and PSP-cortical (-1.1% [-2 to -0.2], p = 0.02) groups. The PSP-cortical group showed greater rates of pallidum (12% [2.7 to 21], p = 0.02), putamen (2.1% [0.4 to 3.8], p = 0.02), and caudate (1.6% [0.1 to 3], p = 0.04) atrophy than the PSP-RS group. PSP-RS and PSP-cortical groups showed greater rates of superior frontal (2.2% [0 to 4.3], p = 0.049, and 4.7% [1.9 to 7.4], p = 0.002, respectively) and precentral (2.6% [0.1 to 5.1], p = 0.046, and 4.3% [1 to 7.5], p = 0.01, respectively) atrophy than controls, with no differences between variants. The smallest sample size estimates were obtained using a metric combining the PSP Rating Scale and the best-performing regional volume, providing sample size estimates of 107 participants/arm for PSP-RS, 88 for PSP-cortical, and 368 for PSP-subcortical.Regional patterns of brain atrophy differ across PSP clinical variants, although midbrain atrophy was common in all variants. Sample size estimates suggest that combining the PSP Rating Scale and targeted MRI volumes provides the optimum outcome measure for clinical treatment trials recruiting patients with PSP clinical variants.",Neurology,"Dec 23, 2025",2025,Dec,23,Kumar M|Tosakulwong N|Weigand S D|Ali F|Stephens Y C|Machulda M M|Schwarz C G|Senjem M L|Jack C R|Josephs K A|Whitwell J L,Kumar M|Tosakulwong N|Weigand S D|Ali F|Stephens Y C|Machulda M M|Schwarz C G|Senjem M L|Jack C R|Josephs K A|Whitwell J L,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Kumar M, Tosakulwong N, Weigand S D, Ali F, Stephens Y C, Machulda M M, Schwarz C G, Senjem M L, Jack C R, Josephs K A, Whitwell J L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41289551/,This study found that different clinical variants of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) show distinct patterns of brain atrophy over time.

41291327,"Lorlatinib and neurocognitive adverse events: characterization, risk factors, and the potentially mitigative role of social support.","Lorlatinib is the preferred first-line treatment for patients with ALK+ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, this drug carries high rates of neurocognitive adverse events. This study further characterized these neurocognitive adverse events, examined risk factors, and, for the first time, explored social support as a mitigation strategy.The Mayo Clinic medical record was interrogated for patients prescribed lorlatinib between July 2017 and May 2022, and medical records were reviewed in detail.Sixty-three patients were prescribed lorlatinib (median age: 59 years (range: 37-82); 31 (49%) men). Twenty-five (40%) developed a neurocognitive adverse event, which had been characterized as follows: ""hallucinations,"" ""noise confusion,"" ""obtunded,"" ""memory loss,"" ""trouble doing simple tasks,"" ""mental fogginess,"" ""vivid dreams,"" and ""nightmares."" In univariable analyses, age, gender, prior brain metastases, concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors, and married/partner status were not statistically significantly predictive of the neurocognitive adverse event. In multivariable analyses, older age (≥ 65 years) was predictive (HR: 2.6 (95% CI: 1.09, 6.26); p = 0.03). Notably, 3 of 14 married/partnered patients (21%) and 5 of 6 non-married/partnered patients (83%) were hospitalized for a neurocognitive adverse event (p = 0.02, Fisher's Exact test). Medical record content corroborated the importance of married/partnered (""spouse is very supportive"") and of non-married/partnered status (""patient lives alone"" and ""children some distance away"").This study further characterized lorlatinib-associated neurocognitive adverse events and confirmed older age as a risk factor. Importantly, social support may prevent hospitalization for a neurocognitive adverse event, and, thus, merits further study, perhaps in older patients.© 2025.

40815797,The MAGIC composite response: a novel end point integrating clinical and biomarker parameters for acute GVHD.,"Changes in the clinical symptoms of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are currently used to assess treatment responses. The Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) consortium has recently revealed that the integration of serum biomarkers with clinical symptoms at the onset of treatment in a MAGIC composite score (MCS) more accurately predicts treatment response and 6-month nonrelapse mortality (NRM) than clinical symptoms alone. In this study, we evaluated whether the integration of serum biomarkers and clinical symptoms on day 28 (D28) would also better predict NRM than clinical response only (CRO). We analyzed data from 1135 patients receiving systemic treatment for acute GVHD and created a fourth MCS category for patients with complete resolution of symptoms and low-risk clinical biomarkers on D28. Using a classification and regression tree model with 6-month NRM as the end point, we identified status of MCS 0 or MCS 1 at D28 as responses, which we termed the MAGIC composite response (MCR). In the validation cohort (n = 309), MCR more accurately predicted 6-month NRM than CRO (area under the curve: 0.77 vs 0.69; P = .014) and demonstrated higher negative and positive predictive values. MCR correctly reclassified both clinical nonresponders and responders: 28 of 213 clinical responders (13%) became nonresponders with fivefold higher NRM (34.3% vs 6.8%, P < .001) and a larger group (29/96, 30%) of clinical nonresponders became responders with sixfold lower NRM (7.6% vs 50.7%, P < .001). These findings support the use of MCR as a superior surrogate end point for long-term GVHD control and survival in future clinical trials.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

40875595,Beyond platelet counts: assessing safety of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use in ITP.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) carries an increased risk of thrombosis, which may be further amplified by splenectomy and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). Although each intervention has been individually studied for its thrombotic risk, data are lacking on the safety of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with ITP who underwent splenectomy between 2011 and 2024. Patients were stratified on the basis of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use. The primary outcome was incidence of thrombosis. Secondary outcomes included bleeding, mortality, and hematologic response. Time-to-event analyses and multivariate Cox regression were performed. Among 88 patients, 37 (42%) patients received TPO-RAs after splenectomy. Thrombosis occurred in 17 patients in the TPO-RA group vs 14 patients in the non-TPO-RA group (P = .07). The 10-year cumulative incidence of thrombosis was numerically higher in the TPO-RA group (57% vs 36%), with clustering of events within the 3 months of postsplenectomy TPO-RA initiation. Venous events predominated; arterial events were rare. No significant differences were observed in bleeding or mortality rates between groups. Platelet counts alone did not independently affect bleeding or thrombosis. TPO-RA use after splenectomy was not significantly associated with increased thrombosis risk. However, early initiation may coincide with a high-risk period, and the sustained numerical difference in cumulative incidence throughout follow-up highlights potential clinical relevance. These findings support the need for individualized thromboprophylaxis and prospective evaluation of TPO-RA safety in this setting.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41151001,Expert Consensus on Genetic Diagnostic Approaches for Patients With Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy.,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is the phenotypic description of a clinically and genetically diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders involving proximal muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdles. There are currently over 30 different genetic forms of LGMD, and despite diagnostic advances, accurate diagnoses may be difficult to achieve. Although clinical diagnosis of a patient with a specific form of LGMD is possible in some cases, a precise and timely genetic diagnosis can be crucial to anticipate and prevent complications associated with particular genetic forms of LGMD (e.g., extramuscular manifestations such as cardiac, respiratory, or cognitive impairments). With the rapid pace of genetic testing advances, updates on training and education are imperative to support the correct use of these tests. We formed an expert consensus to provide an efficient diagnostic approach meant to empower clinicians in the use of genetic and other supportive tests. Informed selection and interpretation of a gene panel; use of genome or exome sequencing; and use of biochemical, imaging, pathology, and electromyography tests are discussed here.

41160790,Effectiveness of Infliximab for Refractory Nonischemic Cerebral Enhancing Foreign-Body Granulomatous Lesions After Endovascular Therapy.,"Nonischemic cerebral enhancing (NICE) foreign-body granulomatous lesions are an immune-mediated complication of endovascular therapy (EVT). No single immunotherapy has demonstrated consistent effectiveness. We highlight the novel use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibition in treating refractory NICE lesions.This multicenter case series describes 3 patients with refractory NICE lesions (recurrent seizures, persistent MRI enhancement, and/or steroid dependence with failure of ≥1 maintenance immunotherapy) treated with infliximab. Their clinical course, evaluation, and outcomes are detailed.Patients were women (median age 57 years [range 56-58]), presenting with headache and seizures within 6 months of EVT for intracranial aneurysm (n = 2) or carotid stenosis (n = 1). MRI (n = 3) revealed unilateral nodular enhancement with vasogenic edema, and brain biopsy (n = 2) revealed foreign-body granulomatous inflammation. All patients developed refractory disease and steroid dependence despite ≥1 immunotherapy including mycophenolate (n = 3), rituximab (n = 1), and/or cyclophosphamide (n = 1). Infliximab treatment resulted in significant clinical and radiologic improvement in all 3 patients.TNF-α inhibition may be an effective targeted treatment strategy for NICE foreign-body granulomatous lesions, expanding treatment options for patients with refractory disease. Larger prospective studies are needed to establish treatment guidelines aimed at improving outcomes in individuals with refractory disease.This article provides Class IV evidence that infliximab may offer potential benefit in patients with NICE lesions after EVT.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Aboseif A|Taha F|Tagg N T|Smith A D|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|Perez Giraldo G S|McKeon A,Aboseif A|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|McKeon A,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.|Departments of Neurology & Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.|Multiple Sclerosis Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Geisel School of Medicine Dartmouth College, Dartmouth, NH.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.","Aboseif A, Taha F, Tagg N T, Smith A D, Flanagan E P, Brown R D, Pittock S J, Perez Giraldo G S, McKeon A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160790/,"This study found that the drug infliximab, which blocks a protein called TNF-alpha, can effectively treat a rare immune-related complication called NICE lesions that can occur after endovascular therapy.

41183253,Natural History and Phenotypic Spectrum of Myofibrillar Myopathies and Myopathies Associated With MFM-Related Genes.,"Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a pathologically defined but genetically heterogeneous myopathy; however, myofibrillar pathology may be absent in some patients with pathogenic variants in MFM-related genes. The natural history of MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes remains poorly characterized.We retrospectively reviewed patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic (January 1993-March 2024) with either pathologically confirmed MFM or myopathies associated with MFM-related genes. Patients without genetic testing or skeletal muscular manifestations were excluded.Eighty patients were identified; 56 were genetically characterized (23 with DES, 10 with MYOT, 9 with LDB3, 2 with FLNC, 2 with BAG3, 2 with CRYAB, 1 with FHL1, and 7 others). Myofibrillar pathology was observed in 60 of 65 biopsied patients. The median age at symptom onset was 42.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20.2-57.0); 66 presented with muscular onset and 14 with cardiac onset. With a median disease duration of 13.1 years (IQR 8.1-24.0) from symptom onset to last visit, all patients had weakness, commonly distal-predominant (n = 34), followed by proximal-predominant (n = 24) and diffuse (n = 11) weakness. Dysphagia occurred in 16 patients, with 4 requiring feeding tubes. Peripheral neuropathy was found in 21 patients (13 with axonal large fiber neuropathy and 8 with small fiber neuropathy), mostly mild in severity. Gait aids were required in 46 patients (median 10.0 years after onset), and 17 became wheelchair-bound (median 19.0 years after onset). By age 60, 67% and 31% of patients with desminopathy required gait aids and were wheelchair-bound, respectively, compared with 12% and 0% of those with myotilinopathy and 25% and 0% of those with LDB3-related myopathy. Cardiac involvement (n = 31) and respiratory involvement (n = 33) were frequent, manifesting at a median of 7 and 9 years, respectively, after myopathy onset. Seven patients (2 with DES, 1 with ACTA1, 4 genetically uncharacterized) died, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications. Patients with desminopathy exhibited earlier and higher rates of cardiac involvement (p < 0.001), more frequent respiratory involvement (p = 0.029), earlier gait aid dependence (p = 0.018) despite a similar age at ambulation loss (p = 0.418), lower prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.022), and a similar mortality rate (p = 1.000).MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes are clinically heterogeneous, with desminopathy showing earlier cardiac manifestations and gait aid requirement and more frequent cardiopulmonary involvement.

41286156,Pancreatic cancer surveillance not recommended for familial adenomatous polyposis: a fine and gray risk analysis.,"Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) surveillance programs are recommended for individuals with a PDAC lifetime-risk ≥ 5% to improve outcomes. While familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is linked to increased PDAC risk, robust data to guide surveillance recommendations is lacking. This study evaluates PDAC risk in a large FAP-cohort.Data were collected from FAP cohorts in the United States (US) and the Netherlands (NL), including individuals (≥ 18 years) with a confirmed (likely) pathogenic APC variant. Cumulative PDAC incidence, adjusted for death as competing risk, was compared with control data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Statistics Netherlands. Data were collected from FAP cohorts in the United States (US) and the Netherlands (NL), including individuals (≥ 18 years) with a confirmed (likely) pathogenic APC variant. Cumulative PDAC incidence, adjusted for death as competing risk, was compared with control data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Statistics Netherlands. The US-cohort (n = 357) and NL-cohort (n = 1000) had a median age at the end of follow-up of 46 years (IQR, 32.0-60.0) and 60 years (IQR, 47.5-72.5), respectively. The cumulative risk of PDAC by age 70 was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.2-8.4) in the US cohort and 0.6% (95% CI 0.2-1.7) in the NL cohort. When combining both FAP-cohorts, the cumulative risk of PDAC by age 70 was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.8). For comparison, the cumulative incidence of PDAC in the general population at age 70 was 0.3% (95% CI 0.3-0.3), corresponding to a relative risk of 2.2 (95% CI, 0.9-5.7).

41287578,State of the art in the management of pediatric lymphoma.,"Pediatric lymphoma comprises 15-20% of the childhood cancer spectrum and represents the most curable end of the disease spectrum with current cure rates exceeding 90% for Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and over 80% for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Whilst these cure rates were achieved over a decade ago, there has been a paradigm shift with current management regimens employing risk-stratified, response-adapted strategies, targeted therapies and increasingly immunotherapy. Ongoing efforts are focused on maintaining and further improving the high cure rates but at the same time limiting the price of cure in term of late effects that survivors have faced in the past decades especially for HL. The current review summarizes the recent advances in the management of pediatric lymphomas and the standard-of-care options for these conditions. Increasing use of PET-CT imaging for staging/risk-stratification and response assessment has played a big role in refinement of treatment strategies. Improved supportive care, reduction in indications, doses, and fields for radiation, and refinement of models of delivery have further contributed to limiting both acute and long-term toxicity. For HL, it is expected that chemo-radiotherapy is likely to get reduced and increasingly replaced by antibody-drug conjugates and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. For NHL, chemotherapy is expected to continue to play a major part along with monoclonal antibodies.

41288364,Convalescent plasma for COVID-19: planning for the next pandemic using the worldwide experience.,"SUMMARYCOVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was the first specific therapy deployed for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. CCP was successfully deployed in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries, establishing that convalescent plasma (CP) is a feasible option for combating the next pandemic. CCP reduced mortality and progression to hospitalization when used early in the disease with high-titer units. This knowledge was gained from a worldwide effort that included more than 50 countries. However, the deployment of CCP was haphazard and varied among countries. Clinical studies suffered from a lack of standardization regarding study design, CCP antibody dosing, timing of administration, and participant disease severity. Unfortunately, the hard-won knowledge from the serum therapy era in the early 20th century, which indicated that effective antibody therapy requires early use in the disease with a sufficient antibody dose, was largely forgotten. Many studies tested CCP late in the disease or without sufficient antibody titer and thus reported negative findings. Trial heterogeneity made it difficult to combine the results of studies. However, despite tremendous heterogeneity in study design and participant populations, meta-analysis revealed strong signals of efficacy when given early with high antiviral-specific antibody levels. When the next pandemic occurs, humanity is likely to resort to CP again. To avoid another chaotic rollout, planning for CP use should begin well before that emergency arrives and must involve both physician education on the principles of antibody therapy and clinical trial designs that test its efficacy in optimal conditions, which include early use with sufficient antibody doses.",Clinical microbiology reviews,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Casadevall A|Mattoon E R|Sullivan D|Joyner M J|Franchini M|Focosi D,Joyner M J,"Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Transfusion Medicine and Hematology, Carlo Poma Hospital, Mantua, Italy.|North-Western Tuscany Blood Bank, Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.","Casadevall A, Mattoon E R, Sullivan D, Joyner M J, Franchini M, Focosi D",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41288364/,"The key finding is that convalescent plasma was successfully used to treat COVID-19 in many countries, but its deployment was often uncoordinated.

41288454,Musculoskeletal disorders following hysterectomy with ovarian conservation: a population-based cohort study.,"To determine the risk of developing de novo carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis in women who underwent hysterectomy with bilateral ovarian conservation (H-OC) before reaching spontaneous menopause.We identified 1,573 women undergoing H-OC for a benign indication at age 18 to 44 years between 1980 and 2002 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Each woman was age-matched (±1 y) to a referent woman who had not undergone hysterectomy or oophorectomy before the matching date (index date). Diagnostic codes for CTS and arthritis were extracted from the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system through 2019. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and the two cohorts were balanced for 19 chronic conditions and for several potential confounders present at index date.Over a median 25.8-year follow-up, women undergoing H-OC had an increased risk of developing CTS (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13-1.56) compared with referent women. The risk was similar in strata by age at H-OC and was higher for women with endometriosis and menstrual disorders indications. Women undergoing H-OC also had an increased risk of developing arthritis (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.23-1.47). The risk was similar in strata by age at H-OC and by indication. Rheumatoid arthritis considered separately was also associated with H-OC (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.05-2.30).H-OC was associated with an increased risk of de novo CTS, arthritis (all types), and rheumatoid arthritis.

41288875,Local Recurrence Rates in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Are Higher with KRAS Codon 13 Mutations.,"Despite advances in oncology regimens and standardization of technical approaches such as total mesorectal excision (TME), local recurrences (LR) remain a significant concern in rectal cancer. This may be due to the complex interplay of genetic mutations driving the disease progression, leading to recurrence associated morbidity and mortality. The association of KRAS mutations on local recurrences in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients has been less investigated.Patients from a single-center retrospective database with LARC (2018-2023) were identified and divided into two cohorts: KRAS mutated and KRAS wild-type. A propensity score was used to match the two groups, adjusting for cT/pT stage, tumour grade, extra-mural vessel invasion, lymphovascular/perineural invasion, surgical margins, TME quality, tumour budding, neoadjuvant/adjuvant radiotherapy. Propensity score matching was assessed with Chi-squared tests. Univariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess KRAS mutations' influence on LR.136 patients were included (68 KRAS mutated; 68 KRAS wild-type). The overall LR rate was 8.1%. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the mutations in codon 13 of KRAS (G13D/G13C) were a significant risk factor for LR (HR = 7.06, p-value = 0.001), with a 33.3% LR rate in those patients. Conversely, other KRAS mutations did not appear to be risk factors for LR (p-value > 0.05).This study suggests codon 13 KRAS mutations may be associated with LR in LARC. However, given the small number patients and events, these findings should be cautiously interpreted until confirmed by larger studies. Preoperative genetic testing for KRAS mutations is suggested to enhance risk stratification.© 2025.

41289025,NAD+-Boosting Ameliorates Heme Protein-Mediated Acute Kidney Injury.,"Understanding how heme proteins and heme induce AKI is clinically relevant from numerous perspectives, and, in this regard, a widely used model of heme protein-mediated (HP-AKI) involves the glycerol model in mice. Using this model, we have previously demonstrated that NAD+ content is decreased in HP-AKI. As there is significant current interest in NAD+-boosting as a strategy in clinical AKI, we examined the effect of NAD+-boosting in this model.NAD+-boosting was achieved by the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in the glycerol model of HP-AKI. The effect of NMN, compared with vehicle, was examined in mice with HP-AKI and with sham AKI at day 1 after HP-AKI was induced.The administration of NMN preserved kidney NAD+ content in HP-AKI and, compared with the administration of vehicle in HP-AKI, NMN improved glomerular filtration markers; reduced histologic injury as assessed by tubular necrosis, dilation, and cast formation and by assessment of dystrophic calcification; reduced expression of KIM1, a sensitive marker of AKI; preserved mitochondrial ultrastructure and increased expression of proteins that promote mitochondrial integrity; reduced apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining and genes and protein expression that contribute to apoptosis, while increasing expression of an anti-apoptotic gene; reduced expression of several renal injury-related genes; and mitigated the severity of the senescence phenotype, as assessed by multiple markers. Finally, the administration of myoglobin or heme in vivo diminished kidney NAD+ content in mice with intact kidneys.These findings demonstrate the remarkable protective effects of NAD+-boosting by NMN in HP-AKI as revealed by a multitude of markers relevant to AKI. The reduction in NAD+ content in the kidney in HP-AKI may reflect the direct effects of heme proteins and/or heme. We suggest that these findings support current interest in NAD+-boosting as a therapeutic strategy in clinical AKI.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41289141,Establishing a consensus definition of VEXAS flare for clinical research.,"VEXAS syndrome is a severe systemic haemato-inflammatory disease with heterogeneous clinical presentations. Most patients experience recurrent inflammatory flares despite anti-inflammatory therapy. The lack of accepted definitions of flare in these patients is preventing development of disease activity tools that are essential for conducting clinical trials. We aimed to develop a consensus definition of a VEXAS flare for use in clinical trials.A 9-member international expert advisory committee established a consensus definition of VEXAS flare using modified Delphi methodology. Clinical inflammatory manifestations of VEXAS syndrome were identified through a systematic literature review. Committee members developed a conceptual framework for flare definition, proposed revisions, and voted on changes until consensus (≥75% concurrence) was reached.Consensus defined VEXAS flare as active inflammatory manifestation(s) of VEXAS syndrome requiring escalation in glucocorticoid therapy. Three flare categories were established: A) recurrence of a prior documented VEXAS manifestation; B) development of a new VEXAS-defining inflammatory manifestation; or C) emergence of a new inflammatory manifestation not meeting criteria for A or B. The panel endorsed an independent adjudication committee to assess Category C flares in clinical trials.This study proposes a standardized definition of VEXAS flare, providing uniform criteria for identifying VEXAS disease activity. Future research will evaluate its performance in clinical trials.© The Author(s) 2025. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology. All rights reserved.

41289513,Sustainability of Complex Interventions: Recommendations from a Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Manage Cancer Symptoms.,"Sustained implementation of evidence-based practices and interventions in clinical settings is essential to ensure patients receive the best evidence-informed care. Information to guide sustainment of complex, multi-component interventions in routine clinical practice after grant funding ends has had limited attention in the literature.ObjectivesThe purpose of this article is to describe the efforts of our multidisciplinary trial team to foster sustainment of key components of a complex electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated symptom surveillance and management intervention for people receiving cancer care at a Midwestern quaternary medical center or community practice settings.The parent Enhanced EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial assessed the effectiveness of a multi-component EHR-facilitated, collaborative care model-based intervention for management of SPPADE symptoms (Sleep interference, Pain, impaired Physical function, Anxiety, Depression, and Energy deficit/fatigue), and its implementation in medical oncology and community practice settings. The Dynamic Sustainability Framework (DSF) posits the need for on-going efforts to continuously optimize the fit of an intervention within dynamic and evolving delivery contexts. This Brief Report uses the DSF to describe our team's efforts to optimize the fit of the core E2C2 intervention components to the practice setting and broader ecological system during the conduct of the trial. These activities were designed to achieve sustained implementation of the intervention in routine care delivery as the funded research activities concluded.Core intervention components to be sustained were symptom surveillance using electronic patient-reported outcome measures, clinician alerts for severe symptoms, access to a registered nurse symptom care manager (RN SCM) for severe symptoms, patient education materials to support symptom self-management, access to a website of cancer-related materials, and the training and supervision of the RN SCMs.Sustainability is dynamic, multidimensional and emphasizes the importance of optimizing the fit of key intervention components to the care delivery context as it evolves time. Investigators are advised to plan sustainability efforts early, embrace change inherent in dynamic settings, and carefully track adaptations of intervention components to maximize intervention fit in real-world clinical practice to ensure patients continue to derive benefit from evidence-informed care.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41289556,CDK12 Deficiency Induces BRD4S to Promote Cancer Metastasis by Enhancing Phase Separation and Chromatin Engagement.,"CDK12 is frequently deleted and/or mutated in human cancers, and CDK12 inactivation is associated with aggressive phenotypes including the tendency to metastasis. Here, we showed that CDK12 deficiency induced intronic polyadenylation (IPA) usage in BRD4 to upregulate expression of the BRD4 short form (BRD4S). BRD4S demonstrated an enhanced capacity to form phase separation despite lacking the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located in the C-terminal of full-length BRD4 (BRD4L). Oligomerization of BRD4S mediated phase separation through a base-interacting structural domain (BID). CUT&Tag and RNA-seq analyses revealed that BRD4S preferentially bound to the promoters of TGF-β signaling genes including TGFB2 and LTBP1, driving their expression. Consistently, BRD4S drove cancer cell dissemination in vitro and metastasis in vivo, which could be blocked by BET or TGF-β signaling pathway inhibitors. Overall, this study identifies IPA usage at the BRD4 gene locus induced by CDK12 deficiency as a mechanism responsible for BRD4S genesis, which represents an important mechanism driving cancer metastasis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CDK12-deficient cancers.",Cancer research,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Li H|Luo J|Liang H|Bai Y|Liu J|Wei T|Wang L|Guo H|Xia D|Huang H|Sun R,Wang L,"First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.|Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, changsha, China.|The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.|First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Chengdu, China.|Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, China.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.|First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.","Li H, Luo J, Liang H, Bai Y, Liu J, Wei T, Wang L, Guo H, Xia D, Huang H, Sun R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41289556/,"CDK12 deficiency in cancer cells leads to the production of a shorter form of the BRD4 protein, which can more easily form phase-separated structures and bind to genes involved in cancer metastasis, promoting the spread of the cancer.

41290367,Outcomes of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE in Patients with Metastatic Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has emerged as a promising treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (mPPGL). This study aimed to evaluate PRRT outcomes in patients with mPPGL in a single institution. Methods: Records of patients with mPPGL who received PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes of interest were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), symptomatic benefit, hypertension control, and treatment-related toxicity. ORR included complete response and partial response, whereas DCR encompassed complete response, partial response, and stable disease, determined using RECIST 1.1. Symptomatic benefit was defined as patient-reported symptom improvement relative to baseline. Hypertension control was assessed on the basis of adjustments in antihypertensive medication requirements. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Overall survival and progression-free survival were also evaluated. Results: Of the 15 patients included in our study, 7 (47%) had paraganglioma and 8 (53%) had pheochromocytoma. The mean follow-up duration was 28.4 ± 19.3 mo. PRRT was the initial systemic therapy in 2 patients (13%), and 2 treated with PRRT (13%) underwent retreatment, receiving 8 cycles. Two patients (13%) discontinued PRRT because of disease progression, and the remaining 13 patients (87%) completed all 4 cycles. The ORR was 27%, and the DCR was 73%, including 7 patients with stable disease and 4 with a partial response. The mean PRRT response duration was 16.2 ± 14.2 mo. A reduction in dose or no escalation of antihypertensive therapy was observed in 13 patients (87%). Ten patients (67%) reported symptom improvement. The most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 anemia and leukopenia (40%). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities occurred in 2 patients (13%), including 1 with thrombocytopenia (7%) and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome (7%). No moderate or severe nephrotoxicity was observed. Hypertensive crises occurred in 2 patients (13%), 1 with a prior history of such events. The median overall survival was 54.8 mo (95% CI, 6.8-102.8 mo), and the median progression-free survival was 26.9 mo (95% CI, 13.3-40.5 mo). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PRRT remains a therapeutic strategy for mPPGL, is well-tolerated, and may improve cancer-related symptoms. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate structural responses and durability.© 2025 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",J Nucl Med,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Belge Bilgin G|Burkett B J|Bilgin C|Durski J M|Packard A T|Navin P J|Thorpe M P|Johnson D R|Johnson G|Halfdanarson T R|Ryder M|Kendi A T,Belge Bilgin G|Burkett B J|Bilgin C|Durski J M|Packard A T|Navin P J|Thorpe M P|Johnson D R|Johnson G|Halfdanarson T R|Ryder M|Kendi A T,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Belgebilgin.gokce@mayo.edu.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and.|Department of Endocrinology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Belge Bilgin G, Burkett B J, Bilgin C, Durski J M, Packard A T, Navin P J, Thorpe M P, Johnson D R, Johnson G, Halfdanarson T R, Ryder M, Kendi A T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41290367/,"This study found that peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a promising treatment for patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.

41290376,Effects of semaglutide in obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction across the age spectrum: Findings from the STEP-HFpEF programme.,"The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) increases with age, and older adults with HFpEF have worse physical function, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Semaglutide demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of obesity-related HFpEF in the STEP-HFpEF trials. Some have speculated that older patients may have less to gain from incretin therapies (and perhaps more to lose) than younger patients.In this pre-specified pooled subanalysis of the STEP-HFpEF trials, we evaluated the efficacy of semaglutide across the age spectrum.The STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials enrolled participants with obesity-related HFpEF and randomized them to semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly (n = 573) or placebo (n = 572) for 52 weeks. Dual primary outcomes (change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score [KCCQ-CSS] and change in body weight) and secondary outcome measures (6-minute walk distance [6MWD], C-reactive protein, hierarchical composite endpoint containing all-cause death, heart failure events, changes in KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD) were compared across specific age groups; <55 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years and ≥75 years.Among 1145 randomized participants, 8.8% (N = 101) were <55, 23.3% (N = 267) were aged between 55-64, 42.4% (N = 485) were between 65-74, and 25.5% (N = 292) were 75 years or over. The efficacy of semaglutide on the dual primary endpoints was consistent across the age spectrum, KCCQ-CSS (p-interaction = 0.80), and body weight (p-interaction = 0.41). Similar benefits were observed for the key secondary endpoints, with no treatment effect heterogeneity across age groups. Moreover, the safety of semaglutide was consistent across age groups.In patients with HFpEF enrolled across the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials, treatment with semaglutide improved disease-specific symptoms, physical function and reduced body weight across the age spectrum. The safety profile of semaglutide was consistent in older and younger patients.© 2025 The Author(s).

41291333,Beyond perfusion: a review of peptide radiopharmaceuticals for cardiovascular imaging.,"Cardiology is continually evolving towards increased personalization with targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. Peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals have emerged as a valuable tool for noninvasive, receptor-specific imaging, addressing limitations of traditional perfusion-based radiotracers like [15O]H2O, [13N]NH3, [82Rb]RbCl and [99mTc]Tc-Sestamibi, which lack molecular specificity. While these conventional tracers provide crucial insights into myocardial perfusion and ventricular function, receptor-targeted imaging can illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases. This, in turn, offers novel insights into disease progression, enhanced diagnostic accuracy, and a tool for companion diagnostics of molecularly targeted therapeutics. Beyond receptor-mediated targeting, recent advances in cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as the development of the cardiac targeting peptide (CTP), offer new opportunities for the enhanced delivery of a therapeutic payload to the injured heart. Their biodistribution can be effectively monitored using radiolabeled analogs. This review explores the role of peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear cardiology, highlighting their applications in receptor-mediated imaging and briefly discussing non-receptor-specific CPPs. Select examples illustrate how these innovations are advancing molecular characterization of cardiovascular diseases such as fibrosis, cardiac amyloidosis, atherosclerosis, and more, reshaping the nuclear cardiology landscape.© 2025.

41291403,Uncovering the neurological substrates underlying restlessness in cluster headache - A functional MRI study.,"Restlessness or agitation is one of the core symptoms of cluster headache (CH). However, the neurological substrate underlying this phenomenon has not been thoroughly analyzed. Whether they are attributed to the core aggression circuit or other CH-related structures remains unclear. The aim of this study is to use functional neuroimaging to elucidate the underlying mechanism of restlessness or agitation in CH.We prospectively recruited consecutive patients with CH from the Headache Clinic of Taipei Veterans General Hospital between Jan 2022 and July 2025. Patients who consistently reported either the presence or absence of restlessness during CH attacks were enrolled and categorized into two groups: restlessness and non-restlessness. All enrolled patients underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. In the restlessness group, patients were required to exhibit restlessness during the fMRI scan, whereas those in the non-restlessness group showed no restlessness at the time of scanning. In this study, 32 regions of interest (ROIs) relevant to CH pathophysiology and the core aggression circuit were selected. To identify restlessness-related networks, ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity was compared between the restlessness and non-restlessness groups. To investigate downstream network for restlessness, ROI-to-voxel analyses were conducted using a general linear model, with ROIs showing significant differences in the initial ROI-to-ROI analysis as seeds. Multiple comparisons were corrected using both the false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error (FWE) methods.A total of 24 patients with CH were recruited and categorized into two groups: restlessness (N = 14) and non-restlessness (N = 10). The ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analysis of CH patients with restlessness revealed a significant connection between the non-pain side locus coeruleus (LC) and the pain-side substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which survived FDR correction (p-FDR = 0.016). Seed-based general linear model analysis further revealed decreased connectivity between the pain-side SNpc and pain-side superior frontal gyrus, which survived FWE correction (p = 0.037). However, there were no significant cortical connectivity from the LC survived the FDR correction.Our fMRI findings suggest that the neurological substrates of restlessness in CH involve the LC and SNpc rather than the core aggression network. Weakened connectivity from the SNpc to the superior frontal cortex may represent the downstream pathway contributing to restlessness in CH.© 2025.

40811832,Non-DLBCL monomorphic and Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD: clinical insights and treatment strategies.,"Monomorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) beyond diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are rare, biologically heterogeneous entities with limited prospective data to guide treatment. DLBCL-PTLD, which comprises most cases, is managed using approaches informed by prospective phase 2 studies, including reduction in immunosuppression and a risk-adapted sequential immunochemotherapy approach. In contrast, non-DLBCL subtypes such as Burkitt lymphoma, PTLDs of T/NK-cell origin, and plasmacytic variants are less common and are typically treated using strategies extrapolated from established treatment algorithms used in immunocompetent patients and sporadic case reports. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD, although not classified as monomorphic, represents another distinct and clinically relevant subtype. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcomes associated with these less common PTLDs, aiming to provide a practical framework for their management.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

41281371,Predicting Nonidiopathic Scoliosis from Plain Radiographs: A Deep-Learning Approach.,"Scoliosis has various etiologies, ranging from idiopathic, congenital, to those with spinal cord abnormalities. Advanced imaging is not always feasible and limited by cost, low-yield, and anesthesia risks in children. Given artificial intelligence's potential, we hypothesize that a deep learning (DL)-based image classifier will demonstrate superior performance in radiographic classification of scoliosis etiology compared witht experienced spine surgeons based on spine radiographs.One thousand thirty-six pediatric patients from single institution with scoliosis diagnosis and paired anterior-posterior - lateral images were included. Patients were manually classified based on their scoliosis etiology from chart review, including previous spine imaging studies when available. Categories included idiopathic, congenital, and spinal cord pathology. Images were randomized and assigned for training, validation, and testing. A DL-classifier using EfficientNet B4 architecture was trained on the radiographs. Accuracy and positive predictive value as defined by precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to assess final performance metrics.The trained classifier performed well at identifying correct etiologies, with F1-Score (harmonic mean of precision-recall) of 0.97. Model precision was 0.99 for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, 0.89 for congenital, and 0.78 for spinal cord pathology. Performance was higher on more common classes, with lower performance observed in class with fewer images. The algorithm has highest overall precision (0.96), recall (0.96), and F1 (0.96), while Surgeons 1 and 2 have lower accuracies (precision 0.80, recall 0.79, and F1 0.79 and precision 0.76, recall 0.67, and F10.71, respectively). There was no clear pattern identified regarding the surgeons' errors and poor agreement on which X-rays corresponded to underlying spinal cord pathology.A DL-convolutional-neural-network classifier has been trained to high degree of accuracy to distinguish between 3 scoliosis etiologies on pediatric spine radiographs. This model could provide a novel tool to clinicians to decide when to refer for axial imaging. It had superior diagnostic performance compared with experienced spine surgeons. After further validation and refinement, a clinician could put a patient's X-rays into the predictive tool for analysis and use the results to discuss with the family the risk of finding spinal cord pathology, helping them determine together the best timing for an MRI.Level III.
