41266918,Surgical Management and Outcomes in Pediatric Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative Study.,"Pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive cancer. The appropriateness of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), role of nodal dissection, and aggressiveness of surgery in patients with metastatic disease remain poorly understood.We performed a retrospective review of patients < 18 years with ACC treated from 2012 to 2022 at 22 institutions participating in the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, genetic predisposition, tumor characteristics, surgical approach, adjuvant treatment, and survival outcome. Survival probabilities were estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods.In all, 69 patients were included (median age: 8.4 years; 58% female), and 28% had Li-Fraumeni syndrome. At diagnosis, 36% had Stage IV disease and 28% had Stage I disease. A total of 55 (83%) patients underwent open adrenalectomy, and 11 (17%) underwent MIS. MIS approaches were employed for significantly smaller tumors (median: 4.4 cm, 38 g) compared with open cases (median: 9.6 cm, 246 g; p < 0.001), and none had tumor spillage (versus 22% in open cases; p = 0.087). Lymph node sampling was performed in 44% of open cases (mean yield: 2.96); no lymph nodes were sampled in MIS cases (p = 0.008). The 5 year overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 65.9%, and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 54.1%. Patients without metastases had significantly better survival than those with more than five metastatic lesions (5 year OS: 84.5% versus 11.9%; p < 0.001).Complete surgical resection remains paramount for cure in children with ACC. Despite aggressive attempts at tumor clearance, outcomes in children with metastatic disease remain poor. Nodal dissection remains infrequently and incompletely performed, limiting conclusions on impact.© 2025.

41266540,Extracellular mitochondrial DNA activates complement and is associated with complement activation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"Synthetic analogues of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported as potent complement system activators. This study investigated the impact of endogenous mtDNA on complement activation. mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) were extracted from human placental tissue and complement activation was determined using ELISA. When incubated in lepirudin-anticoagulated human blood and plasma, increasing concentrations of mtDNA, but not nDNA, resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in C3bc, C3bBbP and soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9). In a clinical context, mtDNA, nDNA, and complement levels of 55 resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients were determined using qPCR and ELISA. C3bc and sC5b-9 correlated significantly with mtDNA and nDNA in OHCA patients. We conclude that mtDNA, but not nDNA, triggers in vitro complement activation, which holds significance in a clinical context in OHCA patients. This novel mode of human complement activation might explain pathophysiological mechanisms of sterile inflammation and could be relevant for innovative therapeutic strategies.© 2025.

40925099,Isatuximab for relapsed and/or refractory AL amyloidosis: results of a prospective phase 2 trial (SWOG S1702).,"Isatuximab is an immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to CD38 expressed on plasma cells. Anti-CD38 antibodies have shown efficacy as monotherapy and in combination in a variety of settings for patients with multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis. This multicenter, cooperative group phase 2 trial was designed to evaluate hematologic response, organ response, and safety of isatuximab monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed AL amyloidosis. Isatuximab at 20 mg/kg was administered IV weekly during the first 28-day cycle, and then every other week during cycles 2 to 24. Forty-three patients were registered, with 35 patients being evaluable for response. The overall hematologic response rate was 77.1%, with 57% of patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) or better. The median time to partial response (PR) or better was 1.1 months. Renal response occurred in 50% (7/14) of patients with renal involvement, and cardiac response occurred in 57% (8/14) of patients who were evaluable utilizing N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with cardiac involvement. The most common treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events included lymphopenia (n = 3, 8.5%) and infection (n = 2, 6%). Isatuximab demonstrated substantial efficacy in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis, and was associated with a good safety profile.

41260234,"What is debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention in orthopaedic oncology? : a global cross-sectional survey of surgeons' practices and opinions.","Following resection of a primary bone tumour, reconstruction is commonly performed using either a megaprosthesis or biological reconstruction. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains one of the most frequent complications. Various treatment strategies exist for PJI, including debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR), and single- and two-stage revision, although consensus on optimal management remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the global practices regarding DAIR in tumour cases through an electronic survey among orthopaedic oncology surgeons.A global cross-sectional observational survey study was distributed to 272 orthopaedic oncology surgeons who attended the BOOM Consensus Meeting in January 2024. The survey contained 19 multiple choice questions focusing on DAIR practices. Responses were collected anonymously and analyzed using descriptive statistics.The survey was completed by 173/272 surgeons (64%) from 44 countries. While 62% (169/272) routinely performed radical soft-tissue debridement in DAIR, only 39% exchanged all modular components, indicating variability in surgical approaches. DAIR was more commonly performed in acute rather than chronic infections, with 55% finding it very useful in acute cases. The use of local antibiotic delivery was supported by 56%, although only 49% found antibiotic cement coatings beneficial. Systemic antibiotic duration post-DAIR varied, with 39% favouring six weeks and 35% preferring three months.The study highlights global inconsistencies in DAIR practices for PJI in orthopaedic oncology, with financial disparities impacting modular component exchange. Standardized definitions are lacking, and we propose that if only polyethylene is changed, then the procedure is referred to as 'poly exchange'; we recommend defining the procedure as DAIR when extensive debridement, lavage, and removal, wash, and reimplanting of all modular components is done while retaining stable stems, followed by suppressive antibiotic therapy; and finally, we recommend that if all the modular components are changed for new ones, the procedure is referred to as 'DAIR plus'.© 2025 Khan et al.",Bone & joint open,"Nov 20, 2025",2025,Nov,20,Khan Z|Khan Z A|Zamorra T|Gulia A|Lozano-Calderon S A|Kurisunkal V J|Jeys L M|Laitinen M K|Abad Repiso S|Abdelbary H|Abiad Mejia A|Abood A A|Abou-Nouar G|Abril Martin J C|Abu Elhamd A|Abudu A|Acosta M|Ae K|Agarwal M|Ajit Singh V|Akiyama T|Albergo J I|Alexander J|Alfaro P A|Alpan B|Alshaygy I|Amaya-Valero J|Anderson M|Andreou D|Annabell L|Anthony C|Aoude A|Arteagoitia-Colino I|Asavamongkolkul A|Aston W|Asua Mentxaka L|Azzopardi C|Baad-Hansen T|Badr I T|Baixauli-Garcia F|Baker G|Balach T|Baldi G G|Barry J|Basile G|Bastoni S|Basuki M H|Bauer H|Bayliss L|Becker R G|Bedi A|Benevenia J|Bengoa F|Bergh P|Bergovec M|Bernthal N|Binitie O|Boddie D|Boffano M|Bonilla Huertas P|Borgognoni A B|Botchu R|Bramer J|Branford-White H|Brar R|Broekhuis D|Broida S E|Budny T|Burke Z D|Cabrolier J|Calvo Tapies J R|Calvo-Haro J A|Campanacci D|Cardoso R|Carey Smith R|Carvallo P I|Casales Fresenga N|Casanova J M|Ceballos O|Cebrian Parra J L|Certain L K|Chacon Cartaya S|Chan C M|Cho Y|Choong P|Chung Y|Ciechanowicz D|Clara-Altamirano M A|Clever D|Colina S M|Consuegra L|Couch C|Cribb G|Cuervo C|Cusick L A|Dadia S|Dagher T|Dammerer D|Davies M|Davies N|de la Rosa Martino L P|de Santos de la Fuente F J|de Vaal M|Deckers C|Delgado Obando J|Deo S|Deventer N|Di Bella C|Domson G|Donati D M|Dorleijn D M|Du Toit J|Dunne D|Duran Ciarrochi R|Ekman E|El Ghoneimy A M|Endo M|Eralp L|Etaiwi M|Evans S|Evrard R|Eward W|Farese A|Ferguson P C|Ferreira Cardoso P F|Fiorenza F|Flint M|Flores H|Freitas J|Fuchs B|Fujiwara T|Funovics P T|Galli Serra M|Gamie Z|Garces-Zarzalejo C|Gazendam A|Gebert C|Gerbers J G|Gerrand C|Ghert M|Ghosh K M|Gibbons M|Gomez-Mascard A|Gomez-Mier L C|Gomez-Vallejo J|Gonzalez M R|Gonzalez-Lizan F|Gosheger G|Goudie S|Goulding K|Goumenos S D|Griffin A|Gulia A|Gupta S|Gupta A|Guzman M|Haitham M|Hardes J|Hardoy F|Hasan Y|Hauer G|Havard H|Haydon R|Healey J|Hernandez Gonzalez N|Hernandez-Lopez A|Hesla A|Hess M|Hilton T|Hongsaprabhas C|Hornicek F|Hosking K|Houghton E|Idowu O K|Ippolito J|Isler M|Iwata S|Jagiello J|Jenkins N|Jeys T|Jeys C|Johnson L|Johnston A|Joo M|Jutte P C|Kaldas K|Kamat A|Kannan S|Kapanci B|Khan Z|Kobayashi H|Kollender Y|Koob S|Kotrych D|Kyte R|Lamo de Espinosa Vazquez de Sola J M|Lazarides A L|Le Nail L|Legosz P|Lehner B|Leithner A|Lejoly M|Lewis V O|Lin P|Linares F|Lozano-Calderon S|Mahendra A|Mahyudin F|Mandia Mancebo F J|Martos Torrejon S|Marx C|Mascard E|Mattei J|McCullough L|McMahon S|Medellin Rincon M R|Miller B|Miwa S|Molina Uribe G|Moon B|Moriel Garcesco D J|Morris C|Morrison S|Mottard S|Moura M|Muster L|Nakayama R|Narhari P|Navas A|Nayak P|Neugebauer J|Newman E T|Nieminen J|Nyqvist E|Nystrom L|O'Reilly-Harbidge S|O'Toole G|Oliveira V|Olivier A|Omar M|Ortiz-Cruz E J|Ozger H|Ozkan K|Pala E|Palmerini E|Pang G|Papagelopoulos P|Paraliticci G|Parry M C|Patton S|Peake D|Peiro Ibanez A|Perez Munoz I|Perianayagam G R|Petersen M M|Ploegmakers J|Pollock R|Powell G|Pretell J|Puetzler J|Qamar F|Raja A|Rajasekaran R B|Ramkumar D B|Randall R L|Rankin K S|Raskin K A|Rassppan K|Repsa L|Ropars M|Rose P|Sadek W|Salcedo G|Saleemi A|Sambri A|Sar H|Scanferla R|Schubert T|Schwarze J|Scoccianti G|Scrimshire A|Sekita T|Shehadeh A|Shoaib A|Shreemal B|Shumelinsky F|Siegel G|Silveri C|Silverwood R|Sinnaeve F|Sison J|Slade A|Smolle M A|Snyman F|Sommerville S|Sood S|Spiguel A|St-Yves H|Staals E L|Stacchiotti S|Stavropoulos N|Steadman P|Stevenson J D|Sullivan M|Sys G|Szostakowski B|Tamburini A|Taniguchi Y|Temple T|Theil C|Thorkildsen J|Tibbo M|Tillman R|Toda Y|Tootsi K|Torner Rubies F|Traub F|Trikoupis I|Tsagkozis P|Tsoi K|Tsuchiya H|Vainio V|Valcarcel A|Valencia J|Van Beeck A|Van de Sande M|Van Den Berghe T|Van der Geest I|Van der Heijden L|Van der Wal R|Van Langevelde K|Vaz G|Velez Villa R|Verspoor F|Verstraete K|Visgauss J|Vyrva O|Wafa H|Walter S|Wan Ismail W F|Wang E|Wang P Q|Warnock D|Werier J|Weschenfelder W|Wong K|Woulthuyzen-Bakker M|Wunder J|Wysinghe I|Yamamoto N|Ye Z|Yoon S|Zainul Abidin S|Zamora T|Zecchetto P|Zhang L|Zumarraga J P,Broida S E|Couch C|Goulding K|Rose P|Sullivan M|Tibbo M,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan.|Medical Affairs Department and PharmEvo Research Forum, PharmEvo Pvt.

41261937,Selection of the Most Appropriate Radiation Treatment Modality for Children's Cancers: A Paediatric Radiation Oncology Society (PROS) Position Paper on the Ethical Utilization of Proton Therapy.,"Proton beam therapy (PBT) offers dosimetric advantages in pediatric radiotherapy by reducing radiation exposure to healthy tissues. However, broad implementation raises important ethical, logistical, and equity considerations, especially in settings with limited access to advanced technologies.This position paper by the Paediatric Radiation Oncology Society (PROS) reviews the clinical rationale for selecting radiotherapy modalities in children, with a specific focus on ethical utilization of PBT. The document synthesizes evidence on the benefits and limitations of modern photon and proton therapies, explores disparities in access, outlines the role of local pediatric radiation oncologists, and addresses the impact of industry-driven messaging on family decision-making.While PBT offers clinical benefit in selecting pediatric cancers, high-quality photon-based treatments such as IMRT and VMAT remain effective and widely accessible alternatives. The referral and evaluation process for PBT is complex and may introduce treatment delays. Travel and financial burdens can exacerbate disparities. PROS underscores the critical role of local pediatric radiation oncologists in counseling families, and calls for balanced, evidence-based communication from providers and industry stakeholders.PROS advocates for an ethical, equitable, and evidence-informed approach to radiotherapy modality selection in children, reflecting holistic considerations beyond dosimetry. Proton therapy should be pursued when clinically indicated and accessible without compromising timely care. Investment in a comprehensive radiation therapy infrastructure, including professional education, collaborative research, and responsible public messaging, is essential to optimize pediatric cancer outcomes globally.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Pediatric blood & cancer,"Nov 20, 2025",2025,Nov,20,Esiashvili N|Indelicato D J|Mahajan A|Parkes J|Paulino A C|Beljoudi G|Kristensen I|Laprie A|Lassen Y|Njiraini P N|Qureshi B M|Robles B G|Seiersen K|Timmermann B|Gaze M N,Mahajan A,"Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.|Department of Radiation Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.|Department of Physics, Léon Bérard Cancer Center, Lyon, France.|Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.|Department of Oncology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Insitut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse, Oncopole Claudius Regaud, Université De Toulouse, Toulouse, France.|Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.|Department of Radiation Oncology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City, Mexico.|Danish Centre for Particle Therapy, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.|West German Proton Therapy Centre, Essen, Germany.|Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.","Esiashvili N, Indelicato D J, Mahajan A, Parkes J, Paulino A C, Beljoudi G, Kristensen I, Laprie A, Lassen Y, Njiraini P N, Qureshi B M, Robles B G, Seiersen K, Timmermann B, Gaze M N",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41261937/,"The key finding of this medical research is that while proton beam therapy (PBT) offers clinical benefits in treating certain pediatric cancers, high-quality photon-based treatments like IMRT and VMAT are effective and widely accessible alternatives.

41263426,Antithrombin Supplementation in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization recommends daily antithrombin monitoring and supplementation to achieve > 50%-80% activity during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Evidence supporting this practice is uncertain, and whether it confers clinical benefit or harm is unclear.This was a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antithrombin supplementation during ECMO. We systematically searched databases and registers for studies comparing patients on ECMO who received antithrombin supplementation to those who did not. Random effects meta-analysis was performed. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two investigators. A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore reasons for heterogeneity.A total of 11 studies were identified. In the pooled meta-analysis, antithrombin supplementation resulted in no difference in bleeding events (OR 1.38, 95% CI, 0.88-2.17, p = 0.16), thrombotic events (OR 1.57, 95% CI, 0.84-2.90, p = 0.15), or mortality (OR 1.21, 95% CI, 0.81-1.81, p = 0.35) when compared to those who did not receive antithrombin. Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in bleeding events or mortality in pediatric or adult patients; however, pediatric patients that received antithrombin were more likely to experience a thrombotic event (OR 1.70, 95% CI, 1.51-1.91). Sensitivity analysis in only low risk of bias studies confirmed these findings.Antithrombin supplementation was not associated with differences in mortality or hemostatic outcomes during ECMO support and may be associated with harm in pediatric patients on ECMO.© 2025 International Center for Artificial Organ and Transplantation (ICAOT) and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Artificial organs,"Nov 20, 2025",2025,Nov,20,Elliott A G|Brinkman H M|Seelhammer T G|Klompas A M|Gerberi D J|Cole K C|Wittwer E D|Wieruszewski P M,Elliott A G|Brinkman H M|Seelhammer T G|Klompas A M|Gerberi D J|Cole K C|Wittwer E D|Wieruszewski P M,"Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Mayo Medical Libraries, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Elliott A G, Brinkman H M, Seelhammer T G, Klompas A M, Gerberi D J, Cole K C, Wittwer E D, Wieruszewski P M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41263426/,"This study found that antithrombin supplementation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) did not improve outcomes, and may even increase the risk of thrombotic events in pediatric patients.

41263428,Impact of Facial Surgery Scars on Quality-of-Life: Perspectives of East Asian and White Patients.,"Inappropriate facial scarring can lead to significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. There is a need to better understand how scar perception varies across ethnic groups, and how it impacts broader quality-of-life domains such as career and sexual well-being. This study evaluates White and Asian patients' perceptions of facial scars related to symptoms, appearance, psychosocial health, and career/sexual well-being.Facial surgery patients from 5 providers were recruited to complete the SCAR-Q and Career/Sexual Well-Being (CS) scales through phone or email. Higher scores on both assessments indicate more positive patient perceptions.Among the 147 respondents, 50.3% were Asian and 49.7% were White. Procedures included blepharoplasty (n=56), rhinoplasty (n=20), eyelid revision (n=19), facelift (n=18), Mohs surgery (n=7), chin augmentation (n=6), craniotomy (n=6), and other facial procedures (n=16). White patients scored significantly higher than Asian patients on the SCAR-Q total (median=260 versus 234), appearance (76 versus 59), psychosocial (100 versus 87), and CS (16 versus 12.5) scales (P=0.004, P<0.001, P=0.026, and P<0.001, respectively). Symptom scores positively correlated with time since surgery in both groups (Asian: r=0.326, P=0.004; White: r=0.319, P=0.011).Asian patients reported more negative perceptions of scar appearance, symptoms, psychosocial impact, and career/sexual well-being than White patients. These findings underscore the importance of tailored follow-up care and counseling to address ethnic differences in scar perception and quality-of-life outcomes.Copyright © 2025 by Mutaz B.

41263492,Global prevalence of multidrug-resistant Candida auris in humans between 2015 and 2024: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen with high rates of multidrug resistance, posing a significant global health threat. Immunosuppressed patients are particularly vulnerable to multidrug-resistant (MDR) C. auris infections. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA) aimed to assess the global prevalence of MDR-C. auris isolates in humans and their resistance to antifungal drugs, primarily fluconazole (FLZ), voriconazole (VOR), and amphotericin B (AmB). A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases on published studies regarding clinical C. auris isolates and the use of antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) assay from 17 March 2015-01 February 2024. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models to determine the estimated pooled prevalence of MDR-C. auris isolates and their antifungal resistance profiles from immunosuppressed humans. A total of 81 research studies were included in the final analysis, with the overall pooled prevalence of the three most important antifungal drugs; FLZ (92.5% | 95% CI: 89.5-94.7), VOR (49.0% | 95% CI: 37.6 - 60.4), and AmB (51.0% | 95% CI: 42.3-59.7). According to the subgroup analyses, FLZ-resistant C. auris was the most prevalent isolate observed in the five continents reporting compared to the VOR- and AmB-resistant C. auris having lower pooled prevalence. Further, higher pooled prevalence of MDR-C. auris isolates were observed from males (68.2%, n = 578) compared to females (37.1%, n = 283). Finally, the global pooled prevalence for mortality in immunosuppressed patients with MDR-C. auris from 13 research studies was 41.5% (95% CI: 29.9 - 54.2). This SR-MA study establishes the variation of MDR-C. auris resistance patterns observed from different continents and the importance to conduct further research studies using potent antifungal drugs. Accordingly, it is imperative to establish stringent surveillance on the increasing prevalence of antifungal resistance particularly in low-income regions with limited research resources to prevent increasing prevalence of MDR-C. auris.© The Author(s) 2025.

41263571,Thalamic Stimulation Induced Changes in Network Connectivity and Excitability in Epilepsy.,"The effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) manifest across multiple timescales, spanning seconds to months, and involve direct electrical effects, neuroplasticity, and network reorganization. In epilepsy, the delayed impact of DBS on seizures presents challenges for optimization. Single-pulse stimulation and resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials (BSEPs) provide a means to assess effective connectivity and network excitability. This study integrates BSEPs and short trials of DBS during stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) to map seizure network engagement, modulate network dynamics, and monitor excitability and interictal abnormalities for biomarker informed neuromodulation.Ten individuals with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing clinical sEEG were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study of epilepsy neuromodulation biomarkers. Each patient underwent a trial of high frequency (145Hz) thalamic DBS. BSEPs were acquired before and after DBS trials. Baseline BSEP amplitude assessed seizure network engagement, and modulation of amplitude (pre vs post DBS) assessed change in network excitability. Interictal epileptiform discharges were tracked by an automated classifier.Baseline BSEPs delineated distinct patterns of network engagement between thalamic subfields with maximal frontotemporal engagement achieved with stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus-ventral anterior nucleus junction. DBS delivered for >1.5 hours reduced BSEP amplitudes compared to baseline, and the degree of modulation correlated with baseline connectivity strength. Shorter DBS trials did not induce reliable BSEP amplitude suppression, but did immediately suppress interictal epileptiform discharge rates in well-connected seizure networks.BSEPs and trials of DBS during sEEG provide novel network biomarkers to evaluate the modulation of large-scale networks across multiple timescales, advancing biomarker informed neuromodulation.

41263784,Relationship Between Aerobic Fitness and Adipose Tissue Insulin Resistance.,"Aerobic fitness is associated with greater skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity with regards to glucose uptake. Whether fitness is associated with an improvement in the insulin36 regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis is unknown.We collated adipose insulin sensitivity, body composition and fitness data from six of our previously published and two of our unpublished studies. ADIPO- IRpalmitate data was available for 340 volunteers and the insulin concentration resulting in a 50% suppression of palmitate rate of appearance (FFApalmitate IC50) measured using the insulin clamp technique was available for 108 volunteers. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the independent variables of aerobic fitness (VO2 peak, mL•kg FFM-1•min-1), age, sex, BMI, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), body fat, percent body fat and the dependent variables ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50.Factors that were univariately correlated (p<0.001) with ADIPO- IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 were BMI, percent body fat, body fat and VAT. Fitness correlated negatively with ADIPO- IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Stepwise regression analysis showed that fitness independently predicted ADIPO- IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 after adjusting for the other significant factors.These findings suggest that aerobic fitness may promote metabolic health through positive effects on adipose tissue.",American journal of physiology.

41264309,Optimal Duration of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Definitive Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.,"The ideal duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for treating localized prostate cancer is unknown due to variable adherence and treatment durations tested in clinical trials.To determine the ideal duration of ADT for patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.This individual patient data meta-analysis of 13 randomized phase 3 clinical trials evaluated the use of radiotherapy alone or with ADT. It included patients with a median follow-up of 11.3 (IQR, 9.5-14.5) years and ADT duration of 0 to 36 months. Most patients (7392 [72%]) included had National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk or very high-risk disease.For this meta-analysis, a systematic literature search from 1980 to 2020 was performed in trial registries (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov), MEDLINE (1966-2020), Embase (1982-2020), Web of Science, and Scopus to identify trials.Intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses were performed. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 distant metastasis at 10 years was calculated based on prognostic risk group. The analyses were conducted from January 5 to August 15, 2023.The primary end point for this study was overall survival, defined as time to death or last follow-up from randomization. Secondary end points included biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality, and other-cause mortality.The median (IQR) age among the 10 266 male patients was 70 (65-74) years. Longer durations of ADT were associated with nonlinear improvement in relative benefits of DM, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and overall survival, with reduced estimated benefits beyond 9 to 12 months of ADT based on the end point. There was a near-linear increase in other-cause mortality associated with long-term ADT use (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50; P = .002 for 28 vs 0 months of ADT). The optimal ADT duration based on 10-year DM was 0, 6, 12 months, and undefined for patients with 1 intermediate-risk factor, 2 or more intermediate-risk factors, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk and very high-risk disease, respectively.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that, for men with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy and ADT, there are relative and absolute benefits from increasing durations of ADT that help provide individualized risk estimates.",JAMA oncology,"Nov 20, 2025",2025,Nov,20,Zaorsky N G|Sun Y|Nabid A|Zapatero A|Bolla M|Joseph D|Maingon P|Guerrero A|Gonzalez A A|San-Segundo C G|Cabeza Rodríguez M Á|Sole J M|Olivé A P|Steigler A|Souhami L|Carrier N|Armstrong J G|Gillham C|Pisansky T M|Schipper M|Sandler H M|Efstathiou J A|Lawton C|de Reijke T M|Attard G|Roy S|Morgan S C|Malone S|Hall W A|Nguyen P L|Shoag J E|Vince R A|Calaway A|Garcia J A|Barata P C|Mendiratta P|Brown J R|Valle L|Rettig M|Dess R T|Jackson W C|Martin T|Jia A Y|Steinberg M|Romero T|Kishan A U|Spratt D E,Pisansky T M,"Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.|Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.|Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto Investigación Sanitaria, Madrid, Spain.|Department of Radiation Oncology, CHU Grenoble, Grenoble, France.|University of Western Australia, Australia.|Sorbonne University, Paris, France.|Hospital Son Espases, Illes Balears, Spain.|Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain.|Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.|Hospital Universitari Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.|Hospital Plató, Barcelona, Spain.|School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.|McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.|St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network and Cancer Trials, Dublin, Ireland.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.|Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center, Milwaukee.|Department of Urology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.|University College of London, London, England.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Rush University, Chicago, Illinois.|Division of Radiation Oncology, The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Urology, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.|Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles.|Departments of Medicine and Urology, University of California, Los Angeles.|Department of Medicine, VA Greater Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle.|Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.","Zaorsky N G, Sun Y, Nabid A, Zapatero A, Bolla M, Joseph D, Maingon P, Guerrero A, Gonzalez A A, San-Segundo C G, Cabeza Rodríguez M Á, Sole J M, Olivé A P, Steigler A, Souhami L, Spratt D E, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41264309/,"This study found that the optimal duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy varies based on their risk level.

41264412,Postprandial Glucagon Metabolism in Healthy and Type 1 Diabetes.,"Early postprandial glucagon concentrations are higher in type 1 diabetes (T1D) than in individuals with no diabetes (ND). To determine the cause, we infused stable [13C9, 15N1]glucagon before, during, and after a mixed meal in 16 ND and 16 T1D individuals to measure glucagon turnover. In a subcohort of 9 ND and 12 T1D individuals, we estimated [13C9, 15N1]glucagon kinetics during steady state. A linear, single-compartment model described [13C9, 15N1]glucagon kinetics and allowed precise estimation of the volume of distribution (VD) and clearance rate (CL). Model parameters were similar between groups, with the VD of [13C9, 15N1]glucagon at 42.1 ± 3.3 mL/kg, implying that [13C9, 15N1]glucagon distributes in a single compartment and with VD approximating the plasma volume and CL at 10.6 ± 0.9 mL/kg/min. Higher early (0-120 min after meal ingestion) postprandial glucagon concentrations (1,907.9 ± 373.4 vs. -93.6 ± 240.5 pg/mL · 120 min P < 0.001) observed in T1D was due to higher rates of glucagon appearance (3.39 ± 2.8 vs. -3.95 ± 2.0 ng/kg · 120 min, P < 0.04) and disappearance (2.13 ± 2.6 vs. -5.28 ± 2.1 ng/kg · 120 min, P < 0.04) compared with ND. We have determined postprandial glucagon turnover in humans and have demonstrated that changes in postprandial glucagon concentrations in T1D are due to increased rates of glucagon turnover during the early postprandial period.This study was conducted to determine postprandial glucagon metabolism in people with and without type 1 diabetes. We wanted to determine the cause for higher early postprandial glucagon concentrations in type 1 diabetes.

41264643,Mitochondrial targeting by measles virus nucleoprotein modulates viral spread in human airway epithelium.,"Measles is the most infectious human respiratory virus: on average, one individual with measles infects 12-18 susceptible people in a population without immunity. However, how measles virus (MeV) establishes infection in the human respiratory epithelium is insufficiently understood. Since our analyses of MeV infections of well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) revealed perturbations of mitochondrial gene expression, we tested mitochondrial function. MeV replication disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and induced superoxide production. This resulted in cGAS-dependent interferon-stimulated gene expression without interferon induction. We then assessed by differential centrifugation whether MeV replicates in mitochondrial proximity. Indeed, MeV proteins and genome were enriched in mitochondrial fractions. We identified a previously unrecognized potential mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) in the MeV nucleoprotein (N), the first protein expressed during infection and showed that the first 70 amino acids of N are sufficient to deliver a GFP reporter to mitochondria. Mutational analyses revealed that arginine 6 and arginine 13 of the N protein are critical for targeting. Recombinant MeV mutants harboring single MLS amino acid substitutions exhibited altered replication kinetics and infectious center formation in HAE, despite similar ISG expression profiles to wild-type MeV. Thus, the MeV N protein amino-terminal arm, previously known only to promote formation of the helical ribonucleocapsid protecting the viral genome, also codes for an MLS. In newly infected cells, this signal may target the formation of MeV replication factories near mitochondria without provoking a canonical RNA sensing pathway. Notably, the MLS appears unique to Morbillivirus N proteins within the Paramyxoviridae family, which are also distinguished by the unique ability to form infectious centers in HAE. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which MeV exploits mitochondrial proximity to coordinate replication and modulate host responses, offering new insights into virus-host interactions at the organelle level.Copyright: © 2025 Durnell-Bettis et al.

We evaluated the benefit-risk of UPA in select subgroups with CD or UC.Patients were randomized to UPA 45 mg (UPA45) once daily (QD) or placebo (PBO) induction for 12 (CD: U-EXCEED, U-EXCEL) or 8 weeks (UC: U-ACHIEVE, U-ACCOMPLISH). Clinical responders were re-randomized to QD UPA 15 mg (UPA15), UPA 30 mg (UPA30), or PBO for 52-week maintenance (CD: U-ENDURE; UC: U-ACHIEVE). This exploratory post-hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety outcomes (adverse events of special interest [AESIs]: serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular [CV] events, malignancies, and venous thromboembolic events) by CV risk, prior treatment failure, and age.This analysis included 1021 patients with CD and 1097 with UC during induction, and 673 with CD and 746 with UC during maintenance. Improved efficacy outcomes comparable to the overall study populations were observed with UPA versus PBO across subgroups. Patients receiving UPA30 generally showed numerically higher rates of improvements versus UPA15. AESI rates were generally comparable between UPA and PBO across subgroups except for numerically higher rates of herpes zoster and serious infections in CD with UPA.UPA resulted in consistent benefit versus placebo across CV risk, prior treatment failure, and age subgroups. No treatment differences were seen in AESIs across subgroups except herpes zoster and serious infections, reinforcing the favorable benefit-risk profile for UPA in CD and UC seen in the overall study populations.NCT02819635, NCT03653026, NCT03345836, NCT03345849, NCT03345823.© The Author(s) 2025.

We utilized a large multi-institutional cohort to explore the relationship between intraoperative 0.05% CHG use and hydrophilic IPP infection.We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional review of patients who underwent hydrophilic IPP implantation. Consecutive cases involving intraoperative 0.05% CHG as an irrigant and/or dip were compared to a similar number of consecutive control cases without 0.05% CHG. The primary outcome was IPP explant for infection. Predictors of infection were assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. Exploratory subgroup analyses further characterized specific 0.05% CHG scenarios.Among 14 participating institutions, 2,150 hydrophilic IPP cases were analyzed. Intraoperative 0.05% CHG was associated with a significantly higher rate of infection compared to using antimicrobials as an irrigant and dip (4.6% v 2.1%, p<0.001). Odds of infection were 2.07 times higher with intraoperative 0.05% CHG (CI 1.37-3.76, p=0.002).

41266257,Consensus Guidelines on Diagnostic Brain and Spine Imaging of Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension.,"Diagnostic imaging of the brain and spine in spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) has evolved rapidly in the past several years, presenting challenges for practitioners seeking to stay current on the optimal methods for investigating and localizing spinal CSF leaks. We established a Guidelines Working Group with representation from experts in diagnostic imaging as well as external experts in the clinical management of SIH. Recommendations and statements addressing the selection and performance of diagnostic imaging in patients with known or suspected SIH were developed by using a modified Delphi process. The intent was to provide guidance across a variety of practice settings in North American health care systems to implement current best practices in the diagnostic evaluation of SIH.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41266372,"Genome-wide association study of 398,238 women unveils seven loci associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer.","Nineteen genomic regions have been associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). We meta-analyzed >22 million variants for 398,238 women from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), UK Biobank (UKBB) and Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/BRCA2 (CIMBA) to identify novel HGSOC susceptibility loci. Eight novel variants were associated with HGSOC risk. An interesting discovery biologically was TP53 3'-UTR SNP rs78378222-T's association with HGSOC (per-T-allele relative risk (RR) = 1.44, 95% CI:1.28-1.62, P = 1.76 × 10-9). Polygenic scores (PGS) were developed using OCAC and CIMBA data and trained on FinnGen data. The optimal PGS included 64,518 variants and was associated with an odds ratio of 1.46 (95% CI:1.37-1.54) per standard deviation when validated in the UKBB. This study represents the largest HGSOC GWAS to date - demonstrating that improvements in imputation reference panels and increased sample sizes help to identify HGSOC associated variants that previously went undetected, ultimately improving PGS which can improve personalized HGSOC risk prediction.© 2025.

41266399,Decadelong low basal ganglia NAA/tCr from elevated tCr supports ATP depletion from mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in Gulf War illness.,"Reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) ratio found with long echo-time proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H-MRS) of deep brain structures in a Seabees Battalion in 1997-1998 was soon replicated by two studies but not in a later one using intermediate echo time. We undertook this study in 2008-2009 to repeat the previous long echo-time 1H-MRS study with 1H-MRS at both long (TE = 270 ms) and short (TE = 30 ms) echo time and higher field strength (3T) to test whether the abnormality of NAA/tCr affecting this Battalion had normalized or been obscured by effects of the T2 decay curve. Under investigator blinding, 39 Seabees in the three GWI variant groups and 16 Seabees controls prospectively underwent 1H-MRS at both short (TE = 30 ms) and long (TE = 270 ms) echo time to measure metabolites and at five TE values between 60 ms and 270 ms to measure transverse relaxation time (T2) in the basal ganglia. A mixed-effects linear model adjusting for age tested group differences. Findings supported the observations of the prior studies, demonstrating that veterans with GWI no longer had reduced NAA/tCr at long echo time but had significantly lower basal ganglia NAA/tCr than controls at short echo time (left: 1.22 ± 0.02 vs. 1.38 ± 0.03, P < 0.0001; right: 1.12 ± 0.02 vs. 1.18 ± 0.03, P = 0.059). The group differences were mainly due to higher [tCr] (left: 14.1%, P = 0.0001; right: 9.1%, P = 0.009) rather than lower [NAA] in the ill groups. Longer echo time substantially reduced the sensitivity of 1H-MRS. Chronic metabolite abnormalities persisted in GWI for 10 more years but remained detectable only at short echo time. That reduced NAA/tCr is due primarily to increased [tCr] rather than decreased [NAA] supports recent studies implicating mitochondrial dysfunction with ATP depletion and neuroinflammation as causative factors and therapeutic targets in GWI.© 2025.

This suggests that GWI is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion, and neuroinflammation, which could be important targets"
40550699,"Pituitary Photon-Counting Detector CT for Cushing Disease: Preoperative Lesion Localization, Intraoperative Findings, and Postoperative Outcomes.","MRI fails to localize a tumor in up to 40% of cases of adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing disease (CD), impacting patient outcomes and creating uncertainty in the diagnosis. Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) is a new CT technology with better imaging performance than conventional CT. PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however, its application to CD remains unknown.We present a cohort of consecutive patients with a preoperative PCD-CT undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for CD at a single institution from September 2023 to January 2025. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced pituitary MRI for baseline work-up and PCD-CT as part of their preoperative planning imaging. Both imaging modalities were used to localize the lesion and guide surgical planning. The accuracies of MRI and PCD-CT were based on confirmation of the lesion location by a combination of intraoperative visualization, pathologic confirmation, and postoperative biochemical remission, and were compared with each other via Fisher exact test.Twenty-five patients with CD were included in this analysis. The cohort's median age was 50 years old, and 88% were women. At diagnosis, 88% had central obesity, 76% had hypertension, 48% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 20% had osteoporosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately identified 56% of lesions, while it was negative in 24% and misleading in 20%. Dynamic contrast-enhanced PCD-CT was superior in localizing CD (P = .01), accurately identifying 92% of lesions, while it was negative in 4% and misleading in 4% of cases. Early postoperative biochemical remission was achieved in 88% of cases, while 84% remained in remission at follow-up.PCD-CT had a high rate of adenoma localization confirmed intraoperatively, even among MR-negative cases, potentially leading to high remission and gland preservation rates. Its role in the clinical workflow of preoperative evaluation for CD requires further investigation, but current evidence supports its value in lesion localization, especially in MR-negative disease.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.
