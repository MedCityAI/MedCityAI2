41364891,Neurologic Sequelae After Ebola Virus Disease in Children in Liberia: An Observational Study.,"The West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in over 28,000 individuals infected, primarily in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Data from previous outbreaks indicate lasting health problems in survivors. The long-term neurologic impact of EVD remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the neurologic and neurocognitive sequelae of EVD in pediatric survivors of the 2015 outbreak in Liberia.In this cross-sectional observational study conducted in Monrovia, Liberia, pediatric survivors of acute EVD aged younger than 18 years at the time of infection and older than 2 years at the time of the visit, along with their asymptomatic close contacts as controls, were seen at a median of 18 months after EVD. The single clinic visit included a neurologic history and symptom questionnaire, neurologic examination, and neurocognitive testing. Seropositive survivors and seronegative controls were included in analyses, with the t test used for continuous variables and the χ2 or Fisher exact test used for categorical variables.The cohort included 31 EVD cases and 41 controls, with a median age of 11 years (44% female). Neurologic symptoms that were reported significantly more frequently in cases than in controls included arm/leg weakness (67.7% vs 4.9%, p < 0.0001); problems with sitting, standing, or walking (22.6% vs 4.9%, p = 0.031); difficulty seeing (38.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.003); difficulty understanding speech (32.3% vs 0%, p < 0.0001); fecal incontinence (19.4% vs 0%, p = 0.0051); and lack of motivation (22.2% vs 0%, p = 0.0052). EVD cases more often demonstrated disability than controls on the modified Rankin Scale. EVD cases ""either sometimes or often"" faced consequences for poor behavior, became upset for unknown reasons, and had difficulty completing tasks independently more often than controls on executive function assessment. There was no significant difference between groups in individual neurologic examination components, frequency of uveitis, or cognitive test scores.Numerous neurologic symptoms were reported more commonly in EVD cases than in controls, suggesting that EVD may have a lasting effect on the nervous system. Limitations included small sample size and reliance on participant self-report. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric EVD survivors, given the potential impact on childhood development.",Neurology,"Jan 13, 2026",2026,Jan,13,Huff H V|Van Ryn C|Reilly C|Nath A|Billioux B J|Yankae L P|Tarfeh-Burnette H D|Johnson K L|Bearden D,Bearden D,"Section of Infections of the Nervous System, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.|Division of Biostatistics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.|Neurology Unit, John F.

41363869,"2026 American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Guideline on Perioperative Pain Management Using Local and Regional Analgesia for Cardiothoracic Surgeries, Mastectomy, and Abdominal Surgeries.","This practice guideline addresses perioperative pain management using local and regional anesthesia for cardiothoracic, mastectomy, and abdominal surgery in adults and children. For adults, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (Schaumburg, Illinois) Task Force on Perioperative Pain Management strongly recommends fascial plane blocks to reduce pain and/or opioid requirements in the first 24 h postoperatively for open cardiothoracic, abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic surgeries and mastectomy. Fascial plane blocks are also recommended in adults to reduce pain and/or opioid requirements after minimally invasive abdominal procedures. The Task Force conditionally recommends use of fascial plane blocks for minimally invasive cardiothoracic surgeries and open hernia repair to reduce pain in the first 24 h postoperatively. For children, the Task Force strongly recommends use of fascial plane blocks to reduce pain/and or opioid use after open cardiac or thoracic surgeries. Fascial plane blocks are conditionally recommended to reduce pain the first 24 h in children undergoing open hernia repair. Overall, data analysis for this practice guideline was limited by low methodologic quality, inconsistencies in outcome measurements, and small sample sizes from individual centers. Future research in regional anesthesia and analgesia needs to address these pervasive limitations.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Anesthesiologists.

41363178,The Influence of Race and Socioeconomic Status on Growth in Children Who Undergo Palatoplasty.,"This study aims to explore whether racial identity or socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with growth trajectory before and after palatoplasty.This study was a single-site retrospective chart review at a tertiary pediatric hospital. This study involved children with cleft palate repaired between 2006 and 2022. Primary outcomes were changes in growth trajectories before and after palatoplasty stratified by race and median neighborhood income (MNI) as a measure of SES.In the data query, 187 and 149 patients met the inclusion criteria for the racial identity and MNI analyses, respectively. The median pre- and post-surgical weekly weight gain was 0.11 kg/wk. and 0.05 kg/wk. for patients who are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) (p = < 0.0001), and 0.12 and 0.07 kg/wk. for patients who are White (p = < 0.0001). Change in median growth percentile following palatoplasty was significant for patients who are White but was not significant for patients who are BIPOC. MNI displayed a significant relationship with weekly weight gain and growth percentile changes following palatoplasty.Patient racial identity is associated with clinically meaningful differences in growth trajectory outcomes following palatoplasty. While growth outcomes may differ across MNI, living in areas with higher MNI does not directly translate to improved growth trajectories following palatoplasty. Addressing all social determinants of health in this population is critical, but interventions should focus on supporting racial minorities as they experience the most significant disparities.© 2025 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.",The Laryngoscope,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Abdilahi A|Ramin S|Morrell N|Tibesar R|Chinnadurai S|Roby B,Ramin S,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Children's Minnesota, Pediatric Otolaryngology & Facial Plastic Surgery, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.|Bahir Dar University, College of Health Sciences Department of Otolaryngology, Bahir Dar, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.","Abdilahi A, Ramin S, Morrell N, Tibesar R, Chinnadurai S, Roby B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41363178/,"This study found that racial identity and socioeconomic status are associated with differences in growth trajectories before and after cleft palate surgery in children.

40875593,"Cardiovascular degeneration in Erdheim-Chester disease: prevalence, burden, and outcomes.","Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare systemic histiocytic neoplasm, with cardiac morbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and cardiac conditions, playing a significant yet poorly understood role in the disease burden. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and prognosis of ECD in patients with (ECD-C) and without cardiac involvement (ECD-noC) and compared the burden of cardiac morbidities with matched controls. Patients diagnosed with ECD between 1990 and 2021 at a tertiary center were included, with cardiac involvement centrally assessed using radiographic studies. Cardiac morbidities were compared with a control group without ECD, matched for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking history. Among 104 patients with ECD, 39 (37%) had cardiac involvement. Patients with ECD-C had higher rates of hypertension (67% vs 46%), hyperlipidemia (67% vs 40%), heart failure (36% vs 8%), and pericardial effusion (28% vs 2%) than those with ECD-noC. Compared with the matched non-ECD cohort, patients with ECD had higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (20% vs 7%), heart failure (18% vs 4%), and antihypertensive drug use (55% vs 40%). Notably, patients with ECD-C had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) from frontline therapy compared with patients with ECD-noC (5-year PFS, 28.3% vs 70.5%). These findings highlight the burden of CV risk factors and cardiac conditions in ECD, even without a clinical diagnosis of ECD-C. Importantly, this cardiac morbidity burden is substantial for patients with ECD-C compared with ECD-noC. Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive cardiac risk assessment and management strategies to improve patient outcomes.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40875887,Safety and efficacy of BCMA-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for the treatment of plasma cell leukemia.,"Despite significant therapeutic advances in multiple myeloma (MM), outcomes in patients with plasma cell leukemia (PCL) remain dismal. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with PCL who were treated with the B-cell maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) products idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel). We identified 34 patients; 19 patients received ide-cel and 15 received cilta-cel. With a median follow-up of 11.9 months, the overall median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4-15) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 13.0 months (95% CI, 8 to not estimable [NE]). The 1-year cumulative incidence of progression or death was 72%, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of death was 47%. Patients who received cilta-cel had a longer mPFS (19.0 months vs 6.0 months) and mOS (>23 months [NE] vs 9.0 months) when compared with those treated with ide-cel. Similarly, the 1-year cumulative incidence of disease progression or death was 37.5% (95% CI, 17.4-68.5) with cilta-cel, whereas all patients treated with ide-cel progressed or died within 12 months of infusion. The rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were similar between patients treated with cilta-cel and those treated with ide-cel and were consistent with those reported in patients with MM. In this first multicenter study that evaluated patients with PCL who were treated with standard-of-care CAR-T products, we show that CAR-T is safe, feasible, and associated with improved outcomes when compared with historic standards.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

40902075,Identification of 4 autophagy-related genetic variants as risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"We investigated the influence of 55 583 autophagy-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk across 4 independent populations comprising 5472 CLL cases and 726 465 controls. We also examined their impact on overall survival (OS), time to first treatment (TTFT), autophagy flux, and immune responses. A meta-analysis of the 4 populations identified, to our knowledge, for the first time, significant associations between CDKN2A (rs3731204) and BCL2 (rs4940571, rs12457371, and rs1026825) SNPs and CLL risk, with CDKN2A showing the strongest association (P = 1.57 × 10-12). We also validated previously reported associations for FAS, BCL2, and BAK1 SNPs with CLL risk (P = 4.73 × 10-21 to 3.39 × 10-9). The CDKN2Ars3731204 and FASrs1926194 SNPs associated with increased CDKN2A and ACTA2 messenger RNA expression levels in the whole blood and/or lymphocytes (P = 5.1 × 10-7, P = 1.58 × 10-21, and P = 7.8 × 10-41), although no significant effect on autophagy flux was observed. However, associations were found between CDKN2A, BCL2, and FAS SNPs and various T-cell subsets, cytokine production, and circulating concentrations of interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, CD40, chemokine ligand 20, and interleukin-2 receptor subunit β proteins (P ≤ .005). No significant association was detected between autophagy variants and OS or TTFT, suggesting that these variants drive disease initiation rather than progression. In conclusion, this study identified 4 novel associations for CLL and provided insights into the biological pathways that influence CLL development.Licensed under Creative Commons

41142377,Infection-sensing minigenome as a novel therapeutic approach against Ebola virus.,"We describe here a molecular therapy that uses the virus's own proteins to combat itself. In this approach, infection-sensing RNAs encoding therapeutic genes are flanked by viral promoters and packaging signals in negative-sense orientation. These therapeutic minigenome RNAs do not express the transgene and remain silent in the absence of a viral infection. In contrast, if the cell is infected, the virus acts as a helper virus, providing viral proteins in trans to transcribe, replicate, and package the therapeutic minigenomes. Proof of concept for this therapeutic approach is demonstrated here using Ebola virus (EBOV) minigenomes expressing two antiviral transgenes: a short-hairpin (sh) RNA targeting the EBOV viral protein VP24 and an open-reading frame expressing a host peptide from the retinoblastoma-binding protein 6 (RBBP6). By using an EBOV tetracistronic-minigenome as a virus life cycle modeling system, we show here that both therapeutic minigenomes suppressed viral RNA replication and viral protein production, and a more than 50% reduction in the reporter signal was observed when cells were challenged with EBOV transcription/replication-competent virus-like particles. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of infection-sensing minigenome to combat EBOV and perhaps other viral pathogens.© 2025 The Author(s).",Molecular therapy.

41223342,Urine Sorbitol and Xylitol for the Diagnosis of Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency-Related Neuropathy.,"Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, due to biallelic loss-of-function variants in the SORD gene, is a recently recognized cause of autosomal recessive hereditary neuropathy. Specific diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone, and molecular genetic testing of SORD is complicated by the presence of a pseudogene. Biochemical testing of serum sorbitol is suggested as a potential biomarker. We report a novel urine biochemical profile of elevated excretion of sorbitol and a second polyol, xylitol, to aid in the identification of individuals with SORD-related neuropathy.Patients with confirmed or suspected SORD-related neuropathy were recruited by clinicians from 7 academic medical centers and 1 nonprofit specialty care center. Urine was analyzed by a clinically validated, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to measure sorbitol and xylitol excretion. Over 700 reference samples were evaluated from residual clinical samples. Clinical and molecular findings were gathered using a standardized questionnaire.Nineteen individuals with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of SORD-related neuropathy (median age 31 years, 47% female) and 715 reference samples were used to determine the initial performance of this index urine test. The median sorbitol excretion in affected individuals was 638 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 456; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 198). The median xylitol excretion was 1,577 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 1,242; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 102). In this patient cohort, the combination of sorbitol and xylitol yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity for SORD-related neuropathy. Four additional individuals who had clinical phenotypes compatible with SORD-related neuropathy had abnormal urine sorbitol/xylitol profile, 2 with genotypes involving a variant of unknown significance in SORD and 2 with a single heterozygous pathogenic SORD variant detected, whereas normal urine sorbitol/xylitol levels were observed in 11 asymptomatic, heterozygous carriers.These data demonstrate the clinical utility of urine sorbitol and xylitol analysis in the screening and diagnosis of SORD deficiency-related neuropathy.

41232063,Altered Interictal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis Connectivity in Patients With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder, with 30%-50% of patients developing drug-resistant epilepsy. Pharmacoresistant seizures remodel critical arousal and respiratory networks, impairing autonomic function and chemoreception and putting patients at increased risk of adverse respiratory events and sudden unexpected death (SUDEP). Given that the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) serves as a key relay between brainstem respiratory nuclei and cortical arousal networks, we characterized interictal BNST connectivity alterations in patients with TLE.We conducted a case-control study of patients with drug-resistant TLE evaluated for epilepsy surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared with healthy controls with no history of neurologic disease. Inclusion criteria for patients included clinical TLE diagnosis and age 18-65 years. Using resting-state fMRI (multiband factor = 3, repetition time [TR] = 1.3 seconds), we measured functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity through Granger causality (GC) between BNST and whole-brain cortical networks, and brainstem nuclei. Graph theoretical network metrics assessed BNST hub properties. Statistical analyses used multiple comparison corrections and age-corrected z-scores.Thirty-seven patients with TLE (mean age 42.5 ± 12.1 years, 43.2% female) and 33 healthy controls (mean age 36.2 ± 12.0 years, 54.5% female) were studied. Patients demonstrated bilateral reductions in BNST connectivity and causal influence with the whole brain (FC: -2.31 ± 2.87, p = 0.0032; GC: -0.18 ± 0.08, p = 0.0025). While FC showed preserved BNST-brainstem connectivity, GC revealed ipsilateral disruptions in BNST influence over ventral tegmental area (0.023 ± 0.026, p = 0.0067), median raphe (-0.009 ± 0.029, p = 0.0038), and cuneiform nuclei (0.012 ± 0.062, p = 0.0153). Critical respiratory circuits showed divergent reorganization: dorsal raphe-parabrachial complex pathways exhibited 57.2% efferent reduction (p = 0.0028), with 204.6% compensatory afferent increase (p = 0.0020), while dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus circuits showed bilateral deterioration (66.2% reduction in dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus [DR→LC], p = 0.0015; 56.4% reduction in LC→DR, p = 0.0189). Graph analyses confirmed compromised BNST network integration bilaterally (p < 0.05).Our findings reveal network reorganization in TLE that compromises autonomic and arousal circuit integrity, leading to failed respiratory-autonomic integration that may underlie respiratory vulnerability and increased SUDEP risk; however, we did not directly study SUDEP cases.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Reda A|Doss D J|Makhoul G S|Monroy Lerma B H|Johnson G|Sainburg L E|Cavender A C|Sundrani S|Liao E|Roche A|Long I|Kang H|Dawant B|Chang C|Bick S K|Nobis W P|Morgan V|Englot D J,Johnson G,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurological Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Nashville, TN.|Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; and.|Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.","Reda A, Doss D J, Makhoul G S, Monroy Lerma B H, Johnson G, Sainburg L E, Cavender A C, Sundrani S, Liao E, Roche A, Long I, Kang H, Dawant B, Chang C, Bick S K, Englot D J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41232063/,"Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showed reduced connectivity and influence of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a key brain region that connects respiratory and arousal networks.

41237355,Natural History of Children and Adolescents With Dravet Syndrome: A 24-Month Follow-Up.,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is an intractable developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused primarily by pathogenic variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene. Patients with DS experience refractory seizures and significant cognitive and behavioral deficits. Longitudinal studies using standardized assessments are needed to systematically document patient outcomes over time. The BUTTERFLY study aimed to assess changes in adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over 24 months in patients with DS.BUTTERFLY was a US-based multicenter, longitudinal observational study involving patients with genetically confirmed DS who were receiving standard-of-care treatment. Patients aged 2-18 years with a confirmed DS diagnosis were included. Exclusion criteria included gain-of-function SCN1A variants, current sodium channel blocker treatment, or other disorders per investigator discretion. The primary outcome measures-adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment-were assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Third Edition (Vineland-3); Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III); and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months across 15 sites. Mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze disease progression, and comparisons were made with published standardized scores for population norms.Of the 36 patients enrolled, 21 completed the study. At baseline, the mean (SD) patient age was 10.8 (5.2) years, and 61.1% were female. Disease progression modeling indicated no significant improvements in 4 of the 6 Vineland-3 subdomains analyzed over 24 months. Receptive Communication (+7.24; 95% CI 1.30-13.19; p = 0.02) and Coping Skills (+4.61; 95% CI 1.14-8.08; p = 0.01) subdomains showed significant improvements. However, for Receptive Communication, this improvement translated to a magnitude of only approximately 3 months in developmental progression over the 24-month period. BSID-III and WPPSI-IV subtests did not show any significant improvement.Despite a relatively small sample size and high withdrawal rate, BUTTERFLY data reveal a widening developmental gap between patients with DS and children with typical development over 24 months. These findings reinforce the critical need for disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying genetic cause of DS to improve long-term outcomes.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Sullivan J|Wirrell E C|Knupp K G|Ciliberto M|Ziobro J|Chen D Y|Flamini J R|Zafar M|LaVallee N|Stepanians M|Ventola P|Chavan T S|Wang F|Parkerson K A|Ticho B,Wirrell E C,"University of California, San Francisco.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.|University of Iowa, Iowa City.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|University of California, San Diego.|Current affiliation: Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|PANDA Neurology, Atlanta, GA.|Duke University, Durham, NC.|PROMETRIKA LLC, Cambridge, MA.|Cogstate Ltd., New Haven, CT.|Porterhouse Medical US, Holmdel, NJ; and.","Sullivan J, Wirrell E C, Knupp K G, Ciliberto M, Ziobro J, Chen D Y, Flamini J R, Zafar M, LaVallee N, Stepanians M, Ventola P, Chavan T S, Wang F, Parkerson K A, Ticho B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237355/,"This study followed children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy, for 24 months.

41325078,"Pharmacological clearance of senescent cells reduces inflammation, endothelial damage and cardiac fibrosis in HFpEF.","Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is one of the most common forms of heart failure with no effective treatment. While chronic systemic inflammation, triggered by comorbidities, is a critical factor of HFpEF pathophysiology and a relevant target for therapy, mechanisms underlying inflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we aim to understand the upstream mechanisms driving inflammation, including immune dysregulation and cellular senescence.ZSF1-Obese rats, a cardiometabolic model of HFpEF, were used to investigate systemic and cardiac inflammation, and to characterise the senescent program in immune, circulating endothelial and cardiac cells, before disease onset and onward. Using patient samples, we further evaluated the association between cellular senescence and diagnostic and prognostic markers of HFpEF. Finally, we administered a senolytic - Navitoclax - at two time-points, before and after the appearance of HFpEF.ZSF1-Obese rats had increased immune and endothelial senescent cells in their peripheral blood and myocardium, together with exacerbated systemic inflammation and endothelial damage, compared to control ZSF1-Lean rats. Moreover, increased circulating senescent leucocytes were associated with markers of disease severity in patients with HFpEF. Senescent cell clearance decreased circulating B-type natriuretic peptide levels and attenuated inflammation, vascular remodelling, and cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, it improved renal function and reduced pulmonary oedema. Our findings suggest that senotherapeutics may improve the treatment for HFpEF by attenuating systemic effects of the disease whilst reducing cardiac fibrosis and endothelial rarefaction.© The Author(s) 2025.

41363909,"Determination of Adult Critical Care Physician Core Knowledge and Skills: Results of a Multidisciplinary, Modified Delphi Process.","In the United States, training for physicians who manage critically ill adult patients (intensivists) evolved through parallel subspecialty critical care medicine (CCM) pathways with significant commonality. The Society of Critical Care Medicine Adult Critical Care Physician Core Knowledge and Skills Task Force aimed to delineate the common core knowledge and skills required of all intensivists.A master list of content areas and procedural skills was compiled from all CCM subspecialty program requirements and blueprints of the certification examinations. Using a modified Delphi approach, participants were asked to categorize the knowledge items as ""advanced knowledge is essential,"" ""general, but not advanced, knowledge is essential,"" or ""knowledge is not essential."" Procedures were categorized as ""intensivist performs routinely,"" ""intensivist only performs in an emergency,"" or ""intensivist knows"" about the procedure.Representatives from CCM stakeholder organizations, including accreditation and certification organizations, critical care societies, and program directors' societies, were invited to participate.Members of the Adult Critical Care Physician Core Knowledge and Skills Task Force of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.For the first two rounds of the modified Delphi process, Research Electronic Data Capture was used. For the third and fourth rounds, the process was completed through online meetings with Zoom (Zoom Video Corporations, San Jose, CA) utilizing Zoom's polling feature.A total of 541 items were determined to be essential, with 145 requiring advanced knowledge and 323 requiring general knowledge. For 73 items, consensus regarding advanced vs. general could not be achieved, but they remained essential. Only eight items were felt to be nonessential. Of the 16 procedures, most were categorized as ""intensivist performs.""The large number of items included in the list of essential knowledge and skills demonstrates the complexity of modern CCM.

41363713,Accurate and Scalable Classification of Colonoscopy Neoplasia using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer associated death in the United States and colonoscopy the primary screening strategy for prevention. Rates of adenomatous and serrated neoplasia detection are inversely associated with post-colonoscopy CRC. This crucial quality metric depends on accurate ascertainment of colorectal neoplasia findings from both endoscopy and histopathology records. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a random forest machine learning model to rapidly and accurately categorize colorectal neoplasia from electronic health record data.A retrospective cohort study compared neoplasia detection rates among individuals undergoing colonoscopy at a large academic institution to develop a rule-based algorithm to categorize colorectal neoplasia from endoscopy reports and pathology SNOMED II codes. This cohort provided a large training set to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system using a random forest approach to automatically classify unstructured pathology findings into adenoma, serrated, or advanced neoplasms. This system was manually validated through an independent holdout set.The training set comprised 35,953 unstructured pathology reports with matched SNOWMED II codes from 95,188 unstructured colonoscopy reports. The final model was assessed on an independent holdout set of 337 manually annotated procedures obtaining an AUC of 0.997 (CI 0.994 - 1), 0.99 (CI 0.98-1), and 0.99 (CI 0.98-0.99) for prediction of adenoma, serrated, and advanced lesions respectively.The random forest-based hybrid NLP system for classification of colonoscopy results was both accurate and explainable.

41364316,Cost Consideration for the Treatment of Peyronie's Disease: A Narrative Review.,"Peyronie's disease (PD) is an acquired penile deformity that causes penile shortening, narrowing, erectile dysfunction, and pain. Current treatment modalities include penile traction therapy (PTT), Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCh) injections, and surgical straightening procedures which have varying levels of expected deformity correction and associated side effects. Similarly, these treatments have varying levels of both out-of-pocket and total costs for the healthcare system as a whole. This review aims to summarize the current literature regarding the costs of treatment modalities available for PD.Current well-supported treatment options for PD can be categorized into three groups: PTT, CCh, and surgical straightening. CCh injection therapy is gaining popularity but remains the single most expensive therapy for PD. PTT has demonstrated modest curve reduction efficacy, and may be an approachable initial therapy modality for select patients. Penile plication and penile plaque incision/excision surgery are more definitive surgical options that are less expensive than CCh injections but more expensive than PTT. While the literature continues to evolve with emerging guidelines and FDA approvals, PTT remains the lowest absolute cost option while CCh injections and penile plication surgery are the higher cost options. PTT and injection therapy are time intensive which must be taken into account in any discussion of cost-effectiveness. More research remains to be performed to consider cost-effectiveness of various treatment options for PD patients while taking into account efficacy, opportunity cost, and patient quality of life. Urologists treating patients with PD must understand the economic aspects of the evolving treatment landscape to effectively guide management for each patient to enhance quality of life and patient outcomes.© 2025.

To investigate immune correlates of treatment response and disease progression, we conducted multi-omics profiling including CD138neg single-cell RNA sequencing of 243 bone marrow samples from 102 patients (631,226 cells) and CD138pos bulk RNA and whole-genome sequencing from 209 samples.

41365534,Functional genomics for improving adoptive T-cell transfer therapies.,"Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown remarkable success in the treatment of some malignancies, particularly leukemia. However, there are multiple factors that limit the durability of ACT in solid tumors, including dose-limiting toxicities, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and T-cell exhaustion. As the manufacture and preparation of adoptive T-cell therapies allows time and adequate conditions for ex vivo T-cell engineering, forward genetic screens can identify novel genetic targets that could improve their effectiveness. CRISPR is a commonly used functional genomics tool that has been successfully used to both enhance our understanding of mechanisms of resistance and to discover potential genetic edits to improve ACT. A complementary approach, Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis provides additional opportunities to identify novel genetic edits without being constrained by the annotated human genome. Here, we summarize forward genetic screens and their tools to uncover strategies to enhance ACT. Complementary approaches can be combined and improved on to identify translatable genetic editing strategies through studies that accurately recapitulate disease-specific challenges.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41365948,Hypergraph clustering for analyzing chronic disease patterns in mild cognitive impairment reversion and progression.,"Identifying the sequential patterns of chronic conditions that precede the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential for understanding both the progression and the potential reversal of MCI. This study identifies common sequences of chronic conditions preceding MCI and introduces a novel, network-based clustering framework for characterizing patients with similar progression patterns linked to cognitive trajectories. We used the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) cohort and categorized participants of MCSA into two groups (i) stay at MCI or progressed to dementia, or (ii) reversion to normal within 5 years after the first onset of MCI. We curate the state transition network (patient level) for identifying and introduced hypergraph clustering (patient group level) to characterize participants with similar sequences. We identified generic key indicators (e.g., chronic kidney disease) and highlighted sex-specific potential indicators (e.g., arthritis, hypertension) associated with MCI reversal, opening new research directions to explore potential differences between males and females. There are certain ssequences of chronic conditions (e.g., originating from arthritis) that are more commonly observed in females. However, these observations warrant further validation. The proposed framework - hypergraph clustering - offers a promising method for uncovering similarities in patients through unique trajectories of chronic conditions that precede MCI.© 2025.

41366130,Characterizing population-wide genomic risk distribution for development of a novel clinical-genomic risk system for prognostication in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.,"Genomic classifiers are endorsed by guidelines and commonly used to inform prognosis in prostate cancer. We aimed to understand the distribution of genomic risk within the validated staging collaboration for cancer of the prostate (STAR-CAP) and propose a system integrating genomic and clinicopathologic risk. We hypothesized that genomic heterogeneity would have implications on risk estimates and may inform treatment decisions.Genomic risk was assessed using the Decipher genomic classifier in two separate multi-institutional, prospectively collected population-based registries: (1) Decipher Genomics Resource for Intelligent Discovery (GRID) [n = 50,891] and (2) Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC-Decipher) [n = 1602]. The primary endpoint was estimated prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and secondary endpoint was distant metastasis (DM). Marginal risk estimates provided by STAR-CAP were combined with hazard ratios of Decipher to calculate integrated risk estimates.Median age and PSA was 68 years and 6.2 ng/mL in GRID, and 66 years and 10.5 ng/mL in MUSIC. The GRID population had 50.2%, 18.5%, and 31.4% with low-, intermediate-, and high-Decipher risk, compared to 48.0%, 16.2%, and 35.8% in MUSIC. Decipher-based genomic risk varied across STAR-CAP stages in both registries. Estimates of 10-year PCSM (0.1% to 48.8%) and DM (0.3%-72.9%) varied widely after integration of clinical-genomic risk. Use of an integrated Decipher-STAR-CAP system led to significant stage reclassification, including 23.4% upstaging and 45.6% downstaging at least one stage.These findings suggest integration of genomic and clinicopathologic risk may lead to more nuanced risk assessment in prostate cancer and may help individualize treatment consideration.© 2025.

41366165,The Role of Primary Tumor Resection in Surgical Management of Asymptomatic Metastatic PNETs: A Retrospective Single-Center Study.,"Cytoreductive hepatectomy has repeatedly been reported to improve prognosis in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor liver metastasis (PNETLM). However, whether primary tumor resection impacts prognosis in asymptomatic synchronously metastasized pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) remains elusive. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of primary tumor resection in patients undergoing cytoreductive hepatectomy for PNETLM.This retrospective single-center study analyzed patients who underwent hepatectomy for pancreatic PNETLM between January 2000 and December 2020. Patients were categorized according to surgical approaches: cytoreductive hepatectomy without primary tumor resection at any time (non-PTR), cytoreductive hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), or cytoreductive hepatectomy and distal pancreatectomy (DP). Surgical outcomes and risk factors for overall survival (OS) were assessed.A total of 118 patients with asymptomatic PNETs and synchronous liver metastases were analyzed. The median OS was 10 years (95% CI: 6.5-12), with no significant differences across surgical approach regarding primary tumor resection (non-PTR: 10 years; PD: 8 years; DP: 9.5 years; p = 0.589). Survival rates at 5 years were 66.7% in non-PTR, 62.3% in PD, and 65.8% in DP respectively. PFS was similar between groups (p = 0.301). Extrahepatic disease and liver lesion count were significant predictors of progression-free survival in univariate analysis (p < 0.050), while resection of the primary tumor had no significant impact (p = 0.749) CONCLUSIONS: PNET primary tumor resection was not associated with improved long-term outcomes in PNETLM patients after cytoreductive hepatectomy. This should spark interest if refraining from primary resection might be an option in selected patients considering the risks associated with pancreatic surgery.© 2025.

41366573,Development of an artificial intelligence based virtual tool for measuring distances during image-guided surgery.,"Image-guided surgery has unique depth perception challenges. This complicates procedures requiring intracorporeal measurements, including gastric bypass, where conventional methods are subjective. Computer vision (CV) has been used for tool identification, which can locate key features for a mathematics-based prediction of 3D distance. This feasibility study aims to develop such a CV tool to objectively measure intraoperative distances.Development of the proof-of-concept digital ruler involved developing a CV instrument detection algorithm, and a computer program to compute and display inter-grasper distance. These were then combined and validated. The CV algorithm was trained by annotating laparoscopic surgery videos to identify the jaw assembly. Model performance was tested against ground truth annotations. The computer program was then developed and tested with manual annotations in a bench-box simulator, using a ruler for ground truth. Both components were combined in a prototype for beta-testing and validation in simulation setting, using a bench box and surgery video recordings. Bench box validation compared pipeline and human predictions to actual measured lengths of simulated bowel. Video validation compared pipeline predictions to those shown by an intracorporeal ruler.A total of 1205 frames (64 cases) were annotated. The model was trained using a 60/20/20 training/testing/validation split. Compared to annotations, the model had a Precision Recall AUC, accuracy, and Dice Score of 0.89, 0.99, and 0.80, respectively. Forty-nine sample measurement frames were used to validate the computer program, with a mean error of estimation of 0.79 cm. Bench box testing compared to a test group showed the prototype's best performance at larger distances (150 cm), with a ""human in the loop"" system. In the video validation, the prototype demonstrated low measurement variability.CV-based techniques can be effectively used to reduce subjectivity of intracorporeal measurement by delivering an objective measurement during image-guided surgery.© 2025.

40811783,Camidanlumab tesirine for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma: a phase 2 study.,"Outcomes in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) have steadily improved; however, additional therapies are needed for patients who relapse or do not respond to novel agents. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of camidanlumab tesirine (Cami), an anti-CD25 antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after brentuximab vedotin/programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor therapies from the phase 2 ADCT-301-201 study. Eligible patients were adults with cHL who had received ≥3 previous lines of systemic therapy (or ≥2 if ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Patients received 45 μg/kg Cami (IV, once every 3 weeks) in cycles 1 to 2, followed by 30 μg/kg IV once every 3 weeks for ≤1 year. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) per 2014 Lugano classification. Secondary end points included complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In total, 117 patients were enrolled with a median age of 37.0 years (range, 19-87). The ORR was 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.9-78.2), with a CRR of 33.3% (95% CI, 24.9-42.6). The median PFS was 9.13 months (95% CI, 5.3-15.0); median OS was not reached. Thirty-three (28.2%) patients discontinued treatment because of treatment-emergent adverse events; the most common reasons were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (n = 10 [8.5%] patients), infections and infestations (n = 5 [4.3%]), and nervous systems disorders (n = 5 [4.3%]). Guillain-Barré-type or polyradiculopathy-type events occurred in 8 (6.8%) patients. Cami was efficacious in this heavily pretreated population; however, the efficacy was overshadowed by substantial issues with the safety profile.
