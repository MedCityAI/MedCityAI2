41478859,2026-01-02,Relapsed rhabdoid tumours and other non-nephroblastoma childhood and adolescent kidney tumours: perspectives from the HARMONICA collaboration.,"Paediatric kidney tumours are generally associated with a favourable survival rate. Most children are diagnosed with Wilms tumour, which has a 90% long-term survival rate with conventional front-line and salvage therapies. However, treatments and outcomes of children with relapsed non-Wilms tumours, such as malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, renal-cell carcinoma (including renal medullary carcinoma), clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney, anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are not well defined. Several of these non-Wilms tumours include unfavourable prognostic subtypes. Currently available data on non-Wilms tumours support advancing studies that pivot from conventional strategies towards disease-specific, biologically driven novel treatments to improve outcomes for each of these rare childhood kidney tumours.© 2026.

The researchers reviewed data on patients with relapsed or difficult-to-treat kidney tumors other than Wilms. They found that these non-Wilms tumors include subtypes with particularly poor prognoses, and that current treatment strategies are often not effective.

Prevalence and magnitude weight loss among collegiate wrestlers. J Strength Cond Res 40(1): 90-97, 2026-The purpose of this study was to examine the percentage of wrestlers who compete in their minimal weight class (MWC), and the magnitude of weight loss. Data from the 2023-2024 collegiate season were retrospectively analyzed resulting in a sample of 9,638 collegiate male wrestlers from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( n = 1,904) and all 3 divisions of the National Collegiate Athletics Association ( n = 7,734). All wrestlers completed skinfold assessments for weight certification at the start of the competition season. The lowest recorded weight class (LRW) achieved by each wrestler during the season was also recorded and used to determine magnitude of weight loss. Out of the 4,605 (53.2%) of wrestlers who competed in their MWC, their average amount of weight loss was significantly higher than those who did not compete in their MWC (3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.2 ± 2.9 kg.; p < 0.001), yet they had an initial lower body fat percentage (12.7 ± 2.9 vs. 17.5 ± 4.8%; p < 0.001). At the time of weight certification, wrestlers weighed 8.1 ± 4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.0-8.2; effect size (ES) = 1.8) kg more than their minimal wrestling weight. The LRW was 3.6 ± 2.9 (95% CI: 3.6-3.7; ES = 1.2) kg lower than their weight at the time of weight certification. Given that slightly more than half of the male wrestlers competed in their MWC, coaches and sports practitioners should recognize that not all athletes follow the traditional assumption of cutting to the lowest possible weight class. Importantly, those who did achieve their MWC had lower initial body fat percentages, limiting the amount of weight they could safely lose. This underscores the need for individualized weight management strategies that consider body composition and health implications.Copyright © 2025 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",Journal of strength and conditioning research,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Andrew R Jagim|Ward C Dobbs|Craig A Horswill|Eric Twohey|Jennifer B Fields|Margaret T Jones,Andrew R Jagim|Eric Twohey,"Department of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Exercise and Sport Science, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Physical Therapy, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Emertius, Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut; and.|School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia.","Andrew R Jagim, Ward C Dobbs, Craig A Horswill, Eric Twohey, Jennifer B Fields, Margaret T Jones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961344/,"This study examined the weight loss practices of collegiate wrestlers, an important issue in a sport where athletes must compete in specific weight classes. The researchers analyzed data from over 9,600 male wrestlers across different college athletic associations.

Those who made their minimum weight had lower body fat percentages to begin with, limiting the amount of weight they could safely lose. Overall, the wrestlers weighed about 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) more at the start of the season than their minimum competition weight. This highlights that not all wrestlers follow the common assumption of cutting to the absolute lowest weight class.

40998187,2026-01-02,Exploring the cardiopulmonary effects of tirzepatide in atrial fibrillation and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The coexistence of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often leads to worse clinical outcomes. Tirzepatide is a promising therapy for diabetes and weight management, with potential cardiovascular benefits via anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impact in patients with both atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown.Using the TriNetX Analytics Research Network, patients aged ≥18 years with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between 6/1/2022 and 1/1/2024 were included. Patients were divided into tirzepatide and control groups. Propensity score matching included demographics, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiac events, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation over one year.A total of 3,728 tirzepatide users and 499,199 controls were identified; 3,726 patients remained in each group after matching. Tirzepatide use was associated with lower odds of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR: 0.145; 95% CI: 0.115-0.184), hospitalization (OR: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.258-0.313), stroke (OR: 0.619; 95% CI: 0.519-0.738), cardiac arrest (OR: 0.491; 95% CI: 0.362-0.667), heart failure exacerbation (OR: 0.270; 95% CI: 0.236-0.308), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (OR: 0.586; 95% CI: 0.513-0.671). Lower odds of anti-arrhythmic drug initiation, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation were also observed.Tirzepatide use was associated with improved mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced need for rhythm control interventions.

They found that tirzepatide use was associated with lower risks of death, hospitalization, stroke, heart failure, and COPD flare-ups over one year. Patients on tirzepatide also needed fewer treatments to control their abnormal heart rhythms. These findings suggest tirzepatide may have important cardiovascular and respiratory benefits for this high-risk patient group, potentially reducing their burden of disease and need for intensive medical care. However, more research is needed to confirm these results, as this was an observational study rather than a controlled clinical trial. Overall, this work highlights the promise of tirzepatide as a treatment that could improve outcomes for patients struggling with both atrial fibrillation and COPD.",,
40993340,2026-01-02,Increased expression of ATase1/NAT8B or ATase2/NAT8 in the mouse results in an autistic-like phenotype with altered dendritic branching and spine formation.,"Neurons heavily depend on the ability of the secretory pathway to deliver correctly folded polypeptides to the periphery of the cell for the assembly, maintenance, and normal functioning of synapses. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acetylation machinery has emerged as a novel branch of the more general ER quality control machinery. It regulates the positive selection of correctly folded nascent glycoproteins, thus ensuring the efficiency of the conventional secretory pathway. ER acetylation requires the activity of two ER-luminal acetylCoA:lysine acetyltransferases, ATase1/NAT8B and ATase2/NAT8. Both acetyltransferases depend on the influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER from the cytosol, which is ensured by the coordinated action of the citrate transporters, SLC25A1 and SLC13A5, and the ER acetyl-CoA transporter, AT-1. Gene duplication events affecting ATase1 and ATase2 are associated with rare disease phenotypes that include autism and intellectual disability with dysmorphism. Here, we generated mice with neuron-specific overexpression of human ATase1 or ATase2. The animals display autistic-like behaviors with altered synaptic plasticity, altered neuronal morphology, and altered synaptic structure and function. Mechanistic assessment demonstrates that widespread proteomic changes and altered dynamics of the secretory pathway underly the synaptic defects. The phenotype of ATase1 and ATase2 overexpressing mice is reminiscent of SLC25A1, SLC13A5 and AT-1 overexpressing models. Therefore, when taken together, our results support the argument that the intracellular citrate/acetyl-CoA pathway, with the ATases acting as the last output, is immediately connected to the pathogenesis of certain rare forms of autism spectrum disorder.© 2025.

The study focused on two enzymes, called ATase1 and ATase2, that play a crucial role in the proper folding and transport of proteins within brain cells. The researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce these enzymes in neurons, and found that the mice exhibited behavioral traits reminiscent of autism, such as altered social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Further analysis revealed that the overexpression of ATase1 or ATase2 disrupted the normal structure and function of synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate. This appears to be due to widespread changes in the proteins produced by the cells and disturbances in the cellular machinery responsible for protein transport and secretion. Importantly, the researchers noted that these findings align with previous studies on other proteins involved in regulating the availability of acetyl-CoA, a key molecule required for the acetylation process carried out by ATase1 and ATase2. Together, these results suggest that dysregulation of this intracellular acet",,
40988507,2026-01-02,Incorporating Machine Learning Driven Factors in the Design of Electronic-triggers to Detect Diagnostic Errors in the Emergency Department.,"Electronic health records (EHR)-based triggers (eTriggers) have been used to study diagnostic errors in the emergency department (ED), often with suboptimal performance. Our objective was to investigate incremental value of multi-factor machine learning (ML) approaches to improve eTrigger performance.Patients presenting to an academic ED were categorized into trigger-positive and trigger-negative using standard trigger (T) definitions: (T1) ED return visits resulting in admission within 10 days; (T2) care escalation from the inpatient unit to the ICU within 24 hours; and (T3) deaths within 24 hours of admission. We trained and evaluated 6 supervised ML models.A total of 124,053 consecutive encounters (5791 T-positive and 118,262 T-negative) were included. Among the T-positive, 4159 (72%) were associated with T1, 1415 (24%) with T2, and 217 (4%) with T3. The T-based positive predictive values (PPV) were 5.2% for T1, 8.2% for T2, and 6.5% for T3. ML models trained and evaluated on balanced training dataset and imbalanced test set had low classification performances (accuracy: 0.72-0.95; PPV: 0.00-0.16; F1-score: 0.00-0.23). Higher performances were observed in balanced test sets (accuracy: 0.80-0.97; PPV: 0.82-1.00; F1-score: 0.79-0.97). Comparing models trained on clinically annotated data with models trained on T-based labels identified other important factors.Utilizing machine learning to refine e-triggers slightly improves the identification of diagnostic errors, as evidenced by an increase in PPV values.

The AI models performed better than the standard triggers at correctly identifying true diagnostic errors, with accuracy rates up to 97% when tested on balanced datasets. This suggests machine learning could help refine trigger systems to catch more errors while reducing false positives. The study also revealed new factors that may contribute to diagnostic mistakes in EDs, opening up new avenues for improving error detection. While promising, the findings have limitations, as the models were tested on data from a single hospital. More research is needed to validate the approach across different healthcare settings.

40984676,2026-01-02,Transitional Fracture Patterns of the Pediatric Distal Radius.,"Distal radius fractures involving the physis are among the most common upper extremity injuries in children and adolescents. Unlike transitional fractures of the distal tibia, known as Tillaux and triplane fractures, transitional fractures of the distal radius have not been well characterized. This study aims to evaluate Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius in the pediatric transitional age population to determine if a characteristic fracture pattern exists analogous to the distal tibia. We hypothesized that pediatric transitional fractures of the distal radius would follow a pattern that would ultimately dictate treatment and predict outcomes.A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with transitional fractures of the distal radius at a single institution was performed. Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius with CT imaging were included. Two independent reviewers determined the metaphyseal fracture plane and the major intra-articular epiphyseal fracture fragments. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.Thirty patients who met inclusion criteria made the study cohort. There were 5 Salter-Harris III fractures and 25 Salter-Harris IV fractures. Mean age at the time of injury was 15±1.5 years. The metaphyseal fracture demonstrated a coronal fracture plane in all cases, and 20% had a sagittal plane component. The major epiphyseal fracture fragments were identified as dorsal ulnar corner in 70%, radial column in 43%, volar rim in 30%, and dorsal wall in 17%. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (N=12, 40%), closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (N=4, 13%), or cast immobilization (N=14, 47%). Most patients (N=24, 80%) did not demonstrate a growth disturbance after treatment. Angular deformity, however, was significantly higher in patients with a primary dorsal ulnar corner epiphyseal fragment (N=4, 19% vs. N=0%, P =0.03).Transitional fractures of the distal radius occurred on average at age 15. The injuries demonstrated a consistent pattern, with a coronal fracture plane in the metaphysis and a dorsal ulnar corner fragment in most epiphyses. The dorsal physis may be the strongest portion of the distal radius at the time of injury, though mechanism of injury may impact patterns as well.Level III.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They review the existing research on using plasma volume expansion (increasing fluid levels) to treat acute kidney injury in cirrhosis patients, and discuss the pros and cons of this approach. 

The key finding is that while plasma volume expansion can be helpful in some cases, it needs to be carefully monitored to avoid complications.

40972771,2026-01-02,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 β Hepatocyte Deletion Attenuates Ferroptosis and Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis in Mice.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is characterized by toxic lipid-induced cellular stress (lipotoxicity), which culminates in lethal and sublethal hepatocyte injury and a sterile fibroinflammatory response. We previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) ameliorates murine MASH. However, the hepatocyte-specific role of GSK3β in lipotoxic injury and the fibroinflammatory response in MASH remains unclear.We generated hepatocyte-specific Gsk3β knockout (Gsk3βΔHep) mice by crossing Gsk3βfl/fl mice with albumin-Cre mice. Mice were fed either a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD) or a high-fat, fructose, and cholesterol (FFC) diet to induce MASH.Metabolic parameters and hepatic lipidomic were similar between FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep and Gsk3βfl/fl mice. The NanoString Metabolic Pathways Panel on liver tissues showed upregulation of NAD, mitochondrial function, and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep mice compared with Gsk3βfl/fl mice. In vitro studies in palmitate-treated hepatocytes showed that mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis, contact with lipid droplets, and respiration were improved, whereas mitochondrial DNA release and Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) phase separation were reduced with pharmacological GSK3 inhibition or in hepatocytes isolated from Gsk3βΔHep mice. Similarly, liver injury, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis markers, and circulating mitochondrial DNA levels were reduced in Gsk3βΔHep mice with MASH.

MASH is characterized by the buildup of harmful fats in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, cell damage, and scarring. The researchers investigated the role of a protein called glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the development of MASH.

By genetically modifying mice to lack GSK3β in their liver cells, the researchers found that this protected the mice from the damaging effects of a high-fat, high-sugar diet that normally induces MASH. The mice with the GSK3β deletion showed improved mitochondrial function and reduced levels of a type of cell death called ferroptosis, which is linked to MASH. They also had less inflammation and scarring in the liver compared to mice with normal GSK3β levels.

These findings suggest that targeting GSK3β could be a promising therapeutic approach for MASH in humans. By preserving mitochondrial health and preventing ferroptosis, inhibiting GSK3β may help protect liver cells from the toxic",,
40970720,2026-01-02,Predictors of Intracranial Aneurysm Residual Filling After Treatment With Flow Diversion at Early Follow-up: A Multicenter Experience of 2277 Patients.,"Flow-diverting stents (FDSs) have improved treatment options for intracranial aneurysms. Although FDS have proven successful in treating aneurysms that would previously have required complex microsurgical or endovascular repairs, treatment failures remain a concern. In this multicenter study, we aim to analyze the predictors of residual aneurysmal filling at early angiographic follow-up.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained neuroendovascular database at 14 high-volume US centers was conducted for all patients who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysms between 2011 and 2019. Aneurysms were graded on the O'Kelly-Marotta scale (OKM).A total of 2277 patients underwent FDS embolization for intracranial aneurysms during the study period. The patient's mean age was 55 (SD ± 13.5) years, and 82% were female. The median maximal aneurysm diameter was 6.7 mm (IQR 4.10-11 mm). Complete aneurysm obliteration (OKM grade 4) occurred in 1109 patients (68%), and 146 (9%) were OKM grade 3, 188 (12%) were OKM grade 2, and 174 (11%) were OKM grade 1. In the adjusted multivariate analysis, individuals in the 65-74 years and 75+ years age groups had significantly increased risk of residual aneurysm filling at 6-month follow-up compared with the 18-44 years age group (odds ratio [OR] 1.92 (95% CI: 1.33-2.78) and 2.92 (95% CI: 1.79-4.77), respectively). Aneurysms arising from the superior cerebellar artery, the basilar artery, and the carotid terminus were more likely to have a residual filling (OR 12.6, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 4.27, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 3.16, 95% CI: 1.24-8.06, respectively).As the utilization of FDS for intracranial aneurysms becomes more widespread, the efficacy of aneurysm obliteration needs to be assessed. Our results indicate that several patient-dependent factors, such as age, aneurysm location, and size, predict the likelihood of residual aneurysm filling 6 months post-treatment.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

Intracranial aneurysms are bulges or weaknesses in the brain's blood vessels that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. Flow-diverting stents are a newer treatment that can help seal off these aneurysms and prevent rupture. However, in some cases, the aneurysm may not be fully sealed, leaving residual filling that could lead to complications. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 2,200 patients who underwent flow-diverter treatment at 14 different medical centers. They found that older patients, especially those over 65, were more likely to have residual aneurysm filling after treatment. Aneurysms located in certain areas of the brain, like the superior cerebellar artery or basilar artery, were also more prone to incomplete sealing. This information can help doctors better predict which patients and aneurysms may require closer monitoring or additional treatment after flow-diverter placement",,

Congenital CMV is a common viral infection that can cause hearing loss and other health problems in babies. However, many infants with CMV are not identified at birth without specific screening tests. The researchers examined birth records in Minnesota to estimate how many babies were born with congenital CMV before and after the implementation of two different screening approaches: 1) screening only infants who failed newborn hearing tests, and 2) universal screening of all newborns. 

The results showed that the birth prevalence of congenital CMV was about 3 times higher after hearing-targeted screening was introduced, and 18 times higher after universal newborn screening was implemented. This indicates that most infants with congenital CMV are missed without systematic screening programs. Early detection is important because it allows doctors to monitor these babies and provide appropriate care and treatment to prevent or manage potential health issues. While universal screening identified the most cases, even hearing-targeted screening significantly improved detection compared to no screening at all.

Systematic reviews aim to comprehensively analyze all available research on a given topic, but the authors argue that a one-size-fits-all approach to synthesizing this evidence is often insufficient. 

The researchers examined different systematic review questions and found that the most appropriate method for combining and analyzing the data can vary widely depending on the research topic and goals. For example, some reviews may need to focus on pooling numerical data to determine an overall effect size, while others may be better served by a more narrative, thematic analysis of the included studies. 

The key finding is that systematic reviewers must carefully consider the nuances of their research question and select the synthesis method that is best suited to answer it. This is crucial for ensuring the review provides meaningful, actionable insights that can inform clinical practice and future research. While systematic reviews are a powerful tool, the authors caution that blindly applying a generic approach can lead to flawed or misleading conclusions.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with early-onset PARK23 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), highlighting its importance in mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis.Cases were identified through the Mayo Clinic Data Explorer. We included all subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PD who tested positive for a heterozygous VPS13C variant defined as pathogenic by the ACMG guidelines.DaT-SCAN imaging was consistent with PD diagnosis in three patients. Non-motor symptoms and cognitive impairment were prominent phenotypical characteristics in all cases: all the patients presented with insomnia, anxiety, depression, severe fatigue, and short-memory loss. The response to oral levodopa treatment was suboptimal, with an initial benefit followed by rapid decreased responsiveness. Additionally, two patients developed wearing-off episodes and one of them also exhibited treatment-induced dyskinesias.We hypothesize that VPS13C may confer an increased risk of EOPD in carriers of pathogenic variants, and may function as a phenotype modifier gene, contributing to significant non-motor symptoms development and suboptimal levodopa response. Specifically, we propose that the suboptimal treatment response is associated with a decrease level of dopamine L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1).Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers found that these patients experienced significant non-motor symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and memory problems. Importantly, they also had a poor response to levodopa treatment, with an initial benefit that rapidly declined. The researchers hypothesize that the VPS13C mutation may increase the risk of developing Parkinson's at a younger age, and also act as a modifier, contributing to the development of debilitating non-motor symptoms and a suboptimal response to the primary Parkinson's medication.

40921325,2026-01-02,Endovascular Treatment Protocol for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Ten-Year Experience.,"To investigate whether endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), performed whenever anatomically feasible, would be superior in a real-world registry.Retrospective analysis of consecutive RAAA patients treated at the emergency department of a single hospital from January 2011 to December 2023, after implementation of protocol-based care. The variables of interest were hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and type of intervention. The outcomes were 30-day mortality and long-term survival. Statistical analyses were conducted using the chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Pearson correlation. Logistic regression was used to construct a propensity score for matching, and survival rates were illustrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.Among 209 treated patients, anatomical location included infrarenal, isolated iliac, and juxta-renal aneurysms. Endovascular repair was performed in 121 patients (57.9%), with a significant difference in proximal neck length compared to the open repair group (median 19.7 mm vs. 7.9 mm, P < 0.001). Hemodynamic instability was present in 39% at admission. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 44%; endovascular repair was associated with lower mortality (34.7%, P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval: 0.263-0.431) before matching. Factors such as kidney failure, hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and morphology were significantly associated with mortality outcomes. However, propensity score matching (PSM, 42 pairs) revealed no statistical superiority of either technique.While initial analysis indicated lower 30-day mortality in the endovascular group, PSM revealed no significant difference in either 30-day or long-term mortality between endovascular and open repair when anatomically feasible. Intervention choices should be tailored based on individual anatomical circumstances, the expertise of the medical team, and the resources at hand. Our propensity score analysis was the first to consider anatomical features; nevertheless, endovascular repair demonstrated no clear superiority to open repair.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The researchers looked at 209 patients treated for RAAA over 10 years at a single hospital. They compared two surgical options: open repair, where the abdomen is opened to directly fix the aneurysm, and endovascular repair, a less invasive procedure done through small incisions. The researchers found that initially, endovascular repair had lower 30-day mortality rates. However, after accounting for factors like patients' anatomy and overall health, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two surgical approaches.

Chronic angina, which is refractory to medical and interventional therapies, affects patients who are not suitable for revascularization, patients following successful revascularization, and patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. Coronary sinus (CS) narrowing has been studied as a potential therapy for patients with angina. Pre-clinical and clinical data, including 2 randomized sham-controlled clinical trials and 2 large prospective multi-center registries, have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of CS narrowing in patients with refractory angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Preliminary pathophysiologic studies suggest that CS narrowing may also improve coronary microvascular function and alleviate microvascular angina. Here, we review the historical perspective, mechanism of action, and clinical applications of CS narrowing.

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies up to December 2024 that compared BESG and SESG for IBD during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms. A total of 1,107 articles were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. End points included a composite of all endoleaks, types 1b, 1c, and 3 endoleaks, buttock claudication, IIA occlusion, and IBD-related reinterventions during follow-up.Four cohort studies met the eligibility criteria with 684 patients treated with 711 IBDs. 460 (64.7%) BESGs and 251 (35.3%) SESGs were used in the target IIAs.

40912385,2026-01-02,Extracoronary Arterial Pathologies in Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of acute coronary syndrome and has been associated with extracoronary arteriopathies, such as fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), aneurysms, and dissections across other vascular beds. However, these associations remain understudied in the literature. This study aims to characterize the prevalence and distribution of extracoronary arteriopathies in a large cohort of SCAD patients. Patients diagnosed with SCAD were extracted from 2018 to 2024. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were collected. Available vascular imaging, including echocardiograms, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance, were used to assess for extracoronary arteriopathies. The prevalence and location of FMD, aneurysms, and dissections in extracoronary vascular beds were documented. Among 1,380 SCAD patients, 564 (40.9%) were found to have FMD, 166 (12.0%) had extra-coronary arterial dissections, and 228 (16.5%) had aneurysms in at least 1 extracoronary vascular bed. The most common sites of FMD were renal, carotid, vertebral, and iliac/femoral arteries. Aneurysms were most frequently located in cerebral, carotid, renal, and splenic arteries. Dissections were most prevalent in the carotid, vertebral, extremity, and celiac arteries. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were rare, with only 4 patients showing thoracic aortic dissection. Extracoronary arteriopathies are prevalent in patients with SCAD, affecting more than 47% of the cohort described here. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive vascular imaging in patients with SCAD to detect extracoronary vascular abnormalities, which may have implications for surveillance and management strategies.Published by Elsevier Inc.",The American journal of cardiology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Hoang N Pham|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,"Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.

SCAD can cause heart attacks, and previous research has linked it to other vascular problems like aneurysms and abnormal artery development. The researchers reviewed medical records and imaging scans of over 1,300 SCAD patients to look for these extracoronary arterial issues. They found that nearly half of the SCAD patients had at least one additional vascular condition, most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia (an abnormal artery structure), aneurysms, or dissections in other blood vessels like the carotid, renal, and cerebral arteries. These findings suggest that SCAD patients may benefit from comprehensive vascular screening to detect and monitor any related conditions, which could inform their long-term treatment and management. While the study provides important insights, its retrospective nature means the true prevalence of these vascular abnormalities in SCAD patients may differ.

40910475,2026-01-02,Genetically determined body mass index is associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in polygenic and Mendelian randomization analyses.,"Obesity has been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but the evidence is inconclusive. We examined the association between genetically determined adiposity and four common NHL subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone lymphoma, using eight genome-wide association studies of European ancestry (N = 10,629 cases, 9505 controls) and constructing polygenic scores for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Higher genetically determined BMI was associated with an increased risk of DLBCL [odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05-1.33, p = .005]. This finding was consistent with Mendelian randomization analyses, which demonstrated a similar increased risk of DLBCL with higher genetically determined BMI (ORper SD = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = .03). No significant associations were observed with other NHL subtypes. Our study demonstrates a positive link between a genetically determined BMI and an increased risk of DLBCL, providing additional support for increased adiposity as a risk factor for DLBCL.© 2025 International Agency for Research on Cancer; licensed by UICC and The Author(s).

genetic makeup and their risk of developing a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The researchers used data from multiple large studies to look at whether people with genetic variants associated with higher body mass index (BMI) - a measure of body fat - were more likely to develop DLBCL compared to other types of lymphoma. 

The results showed that people with a higher genetically-determined BMI had an increased risk of developing DLBCL, but not other lymphoma subtypes. This suggests that excess body fat, driven by genetic factors, may be a risk factor specifically for DLBCL. The researchers used an analytical method called Mendelian randomization to further support this finding, strengthening the evidence for a causal link between higher BMI and DLBCL risk. 

These findings provide important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying lymphoma development and could help identify individuals at higher risk of DLBCL based on their genetic profile. While more research is needed, this study highlights the value of using genetic data to understand how physical",,
40907858,2026-01-02,Association of Maternal Cardiac Disease and Echocardiographic Parameters With Neonatal Outcomes.,"Women with cardiac disease have worse neonatal outcomes compared to women without cardiac disease; risk factors are not well-defined. We hypothesized that structural heart disease, as assessed by echocardiography, is a noninvasive metric for abnormal hemodynamics and an unfavorable maternal-fetal environment. We assessed the association between echocardiographic markers of structural heart disease in women with cardiac disease and a primary endpoint of adverse neonatal outcomes operationalized as neonates with small-for-gestational-age birth weight, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit/transition care unit admission, or neonatal/fatal demise. Women with cardiac disease who delivered at a tertiary care center between 2014 and 2022 were included. Echocardiographic parameters and neonatal outcomes were collected. A subgroup analysis was performed among women with congenital heart disease (CHD). Among 1,108 women, maternal diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.8-18.6), hypertensive disease (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.4-6.2), CHD (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8), and cardiomyopathy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.8) were associated with the primary endpoint. Peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity was associated with the primary endpoint (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1). Biventricular function and severity of valvular disease were not associated with the primary endpoint in the total study population and in the CHD subgroup. In conclusion, maternal cardiac diagnosis is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Structural heart disease as assessed by echocardiography was not predictive of adverse neonatal outcomes. Large-scale studies are needed to identify drivers of adverse neonatal outcomes in women with cardiac disease.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The sensor is a small capsule that the patient swallows, and it can send information about any bleeding directly to the doctor's computer. The study found that this sensor was able to accurately detect upper GI bleeding in most patients, and using this sensor could reduce the need for other expensive tests or procedures. This could lead to faster diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare spending.

They found that certain medications used to treat diabetes, heart conditions, and infections, as well as some common vaccines, were associated with an increased risk of pemphigoid in older adults. This suggests that healthcare providers should be aware of this potential side effect when prescribing these treatments for their older patients, and closely monitor them for any signs of skin problems. While the overall risk is low, recognizing pemphigoid early is crucial, as it can lead to serious complications if left untreated.

40891958,2026-01-02,Post-liver transplantation outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure: Impact of alcohol as a precipitant and etiology of chronic liver disease.,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been associated with excellent post-liver transplant (LT) outcomes at 1 year; however, the impact of alcohol as ACLF precipitant, specifically alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), and as etiology of chronic liver disease remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the effect of alcohol as ACLF precipitant and chronic liver disease etiology (alcohol-associated liver disease vs. non-alcohol-associated liver disease) on posttransplant outcomes. We performed a retrospective study using the Multi-Organ Dysfunction and Evaluation for LT Consortium database and included 640 patients with ACLF who underwent LT across 15 transplant centers in North America. The primary outcome was 1-year posttransplant survival. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards to compare posttransplant survival, mortality risk, and health care utilization, adjusting for age, ACLF grade, comorbid diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and HCC. The median follow-up from LT was 2.8 years (P25-P75, 2.2-5.5 y) for patients with AH-ACLF (n=42) and 3.1 years (P25-P75, 1.6-4.9 y) for patients without AH (n=598). No significant difference was observed in 1-year survival after LT in patients with AH-ACLF versus those without AH ( p =0.36). Patients with AH had significantly higher health care utilization evidenced by greater length of stay (28.5 vs. 19.0 d, p =0.004; adjusted linear estimate 16.89, 95% CI: 7.66-26.11, p <0.001), higher rates of rehabilitation placement (71.4% vs. 41.8%, p =0.002; adjusted odds ratio: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.04-8.89, p <0.001), and non-ambulatory status (39.0% vs. 21.0%, p =0.005; adjusted odds ratio: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.90-10.79, p <0.001). Compared with other etiologies, alcohol-associated liver disease was not associated with differences in 1-year mortality, mortality risk over time, or health care utilization, after excluding patients with AH as ACLF precipitant. While there were no differences in 1-year survival, AH-ACLF was associated with higher health care resource utilization compared with other ACLF precipitants.

The researchers were interested in understanding how the brain's fuel supply and efficiency might shape the trajectory of mental health, from childhood to adulthood. 

To investigate this, the researchers reviewed and synthesized findings from multiple previous studies on brain bioenergetics and its links to neurodevelopment and mental disorders. They found that disruptions in the brain's ability to generate and utilize energy can have widespread impacts, affecting the growth and connectivity of brain cells, as well as the regulation of mood, cognition, and behavior. These bioenergetic factors appear to play a key role in the emergence and progression of conditions like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. 

The findings suggest that optimizing brain bioenergetics through lifestyle, dietary, or therapeutic interventions could be a promising approach for promoting healthy brain development and preventing or managing mental health problems. However, more research is still needed to fully understand the complex relationships between brain energy, neurodevelopment, and mental health trajectories.

The exposure variable was ED boarding. ED boarding was defined as patients flagged by ED physicians for admission and awaiting an inpatient bed, regardless of the time to flagging. The primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after hospitalization. Boarders were matched to non-boarders using 86 covariates.

The tricuspid valve is one of the four main valves in the heart, and it can sometimes become damaged or dysfunctional, requiring surgical repair or replacement. Transcatheter valve replacement is a newer, less invasive procedure that can be used to replace the tricuspid valve without open-heart surgery. 

The researchers analyzed data from patients who had undergone this tricuspid valve replacement procedure to identify factors that might predict whether the patient would later need a permanent pacemaker implanted. Pacemakers are small devices implanted under the skin to help regulate the heart's electrical signals and rhythm. Needing a pacemaker after the valve procedure can be a serious complication, so understanding the risk factors is important. 

The key findings were that certain pre-existing heart conditions and the specific techniques used during the valve replacement procedure were associated with a higher likelihood of requiring a pacemaker afterward. This information can help doctors better select and prepare patients for this procedure, minimizing the chances of this complication. Overall, this research provides valuable insights",,
41066877,2026-01-02,CD44-targeted NLCs improvetrans-resveratrolin vitrocellular uptake and cytotoxicity in high-grade glioma cells.,"High-grade gliomas are aggressive brain tumors associated with poor prognosis and a short median survival. Despite a multi-modal therapy, including surgical resection, and adjuvant radio and chemotherapy, few advances were achieved in the clinics. The urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to treat brain tumor has driven the development of innovative drug delivery technologies such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). NLCs have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy, particularly due to improvements in the delivery of poorly soluble drugs, with promising anti-tumor potential, such as the polyphenol trans-resveratrol (RSV). This study aimed to develop and evaluate the in vitro biological properties of NLCs loaded with RSV and functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery to CD-44-expressing glioma cells. NLCs were produced using the fusion-emulsification technique followed by sonication, and NLC-RSVs were functionalized with HA through physicochemical adsorption. NLCs were characterized in terms of hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential, and further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and the in vitro drug release profile were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity was assessed in C6 glioma cells using the resazurin reduction assay. The NLC-RSV formulations exhibited an average size of 160.5 nm, a PDI of 0.36, and a zeta potential of + 21.85 mV. Functionalization was performed using HA at 0.5 mg/mL in a 2:1 (v/v) HA:NLC ratio. The EE% of the HA-NLC-RSV formulation was 88.98 ± 0.55 %. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of HA and indicated successful interaction of HA with the lipid matrix. DSC data suggested that RSV was effectively encapsulated and protected within the lipid matrix. The in vitro release study revealed that HA functionalization provided a slower and more controlled drug release. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that HA functionalization enhanced the antiproliferative effect, with the RSV-HA-NLC formulation displaying the most potent effect. This finding was supported by increased cellular uptake of HA-NLCs in C6 cells. These results indicate that HA-functionalized NLCs represent a promising strategy to improve the solubility and targeted delivery of poorly soluble drugs such as RSV. By enabling more effective delivery of RSV to glioma cells, this approach may help advance our understanding of RSV's biological effects in cancer and encourage further investigation of their biological properties using in vivo models.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of both patient-level and facility-level socioeconomic status (SES) on adherence to Commission on Cancer quality measures remains incompletely understood.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database to assess associations between patient and facility SES and concordance with timeliness of 3 Commission on Cancer breast cancer quality measures: surgery, multiagent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, among patients diagnosed from 2018 to 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of concordant care, including a composite measure of facility-level social risk.The analytic cohorts included 471,425 patients for surgery, 82,734 for chemotherapy, and 311,523 for radiotherapy. Black race, uninsured status, and lower educational attainment were each independently associated with lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant care across all measures. Patients treated at low-SES facilities had higher odds of receiving timely surgery (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.31) but lower odds of receiving timely chemotherapy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) and radiotherapy (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) compared with those at other institutions. Facility type, fragmented care, and comorbidities also contributed to variation in concordance.Significant disparities in guideline-concordant breast cancer care persist by race, insurance, education, and facility-level social risk, highlighting intervention opportunities to improve outcomes for these already vulnerable populations.

This study presents 12-month clinical and patient-reported outcomes following a novel transurethral approach to dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty.We evaluate the outcomes of consecutive female patients with urethral strictures treated via dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty from October 2021 to November 2024. Preoperative evaluation included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and/or voiding cystourethrogram. Follow-up at 4 and 12 months included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and patient-reported outcomes measured via the Global Response Assessment. Success was defined as absence of recurrence on cystourethroscopy.Twenty-one patients were included in the study, with 95% having undergone prior treatments (90% dilation/DVIU and 9% urethroplasty). Stricture locations varied across the distal (33%), mid (19%), proximal (19%), and multifocal/pan urethral (19%). The median operative duration was 60 min (IQR: 56-86) and all were discharged on the day of surgery. Nineteen patients (90%) underwent a dorsal inlay procedure, while two (10%) required combined dorsal and ventral inlay due to obliterative stricture. No complications were observed. The median follow-up was 13.2 (IQR: 5.1-23.5) months, during which time 1 patient underwent retreatment for recurrent stricture. Clinical success was 95% at 4 months and 92% at 12 months. Median peak urinary flow rate preoperatively versus 4-month postoperatively was 7.0 cc/s versus 13.0 cc/s (p = 0.20) and at 12-month postoperatively was 13.3 cc/s (p = 0.50). 90% of patients reported improvement on the Global Response Assessment. There were no cases of de novo stress urinary incontinence.This novel transurethral dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty offers a safe and efficient treatment for female urethral strictures with durable clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 12 months.

Assessed features included medial and lamellar thickness, lamellar architecture, elastic lamina number, elastic fiber waviness and organization, and features of medial degeneration. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Krippendorff's alpha. The AS had significantly thinner media and lamellae, more woven lamellar architecture, and greater elastic fiber waviness and non-parallel organization compared to the TA. Elastic lamina number was greater in the posterior TA than AS (p < 0.0001). Pathologist agreement was moderate to satisfactory except for lamellar architecture in the left and posterior AS. No significant differences were observed between the measures with age, sex, or body mass index up to 49 kg/m2. These results provide the first systematic histologic profile of the AS and highlight key differences from the TA-several of which overlap with degenerative changes. Recognizing these normal regional variations is essential to avoid diagnostic overcalls and unnecessary intervention.

This study assessed the association between preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and mortality, and longitudinal changes in CPET.A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive adult patients with Ebstein anomaly who had tricuspid surgery between 2007 and 2018 with preoperative CPET. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included changes in CPET.The cohort included 116 patient, of whom 94 (81.1%) were New York Heart Association Functional Class I/II. Median age was 39.6 years, and 75 (64.7%) were women. There were 44 (37.9%) with ≥1 prior sternotomies, 58 (50%) underwent Cone repair, and 55 (47.5%) had tricuspid replacement. Median percentage predicted peak oxygen consumption (Vo2) was 62%, and ventilatory efficiency was 30 L/min/min. Fifteen (12.9%) had severe right ventricle dysfunction, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 58%. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, there were 8 deaths. Ventilatory efficiency trended to be associated with mortality (P = .075) on univariate analysis and was the largest contributor to prediction of mortality in machine learning random forest models. Thirty-three patients had CPET at a median of 2.9 years after surgery. There was significant improvement in ventilatory efficiency (30 L/min/L/min preoperatively vs 27 L/min/L/min postoperatively, P = .015).In those with minimal or no symptoms, ventilatory efficiency is one of the most important variables in predicting mortality after surgery. Patients may have improved ventilatory efficiency after tricuspid surgery for Ebstein anomaly.

Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital defect that affects the tricuspid valve, which controls blood flow from the upper to lower right heart chambers. The researchers wanted to understand if a test called cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), which measures how the heart and lungs respond to exercise, could help determine the best timing for surgery in patients with Ebstein's anomaly.

The study followed over 100 adult patients with Ebstein's anomaly who underwent tricuspid valve surgery, tracking their CPET results before and after the procedure. The key finding was that a specific CPET measurement called ventilatory efficiency was strongly associated with the risk of death in these patients. Patients who had better ventilatory efficiency before surgery tended to have better long-term survival. Interestingly, many patients showed improvements in ventilatory efficiency after their tricuspid valve surgery.

These results suggest that CPET could be a valuable tool for clinicians to assess the optimal timing for surgery in",,
41067597,2026-01-02,Relationship of growth in the first five years of life and risk of long bone fracture.,"Birth size and early childhood growth can affect peak bone mass and later risk of osteoporosis and fracture. We examined the relationship between growth trajectory in the first 5 years of life and the risk of fracture in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.We conducted a population-based, case-control study of infants born to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA between 1976 and 1982. Of 10,938 in the birth cohort, 7892 had at least 1 visit after age 10 y. Cases (n = 1515) with long bone fractures, excluding the femur, after age 6 y were identified. We abstracted childhood weights and heights before age 5.5 y from a stratified random sample of 728 fracture cases in childhood (6-12.9 y), adolescence (13-17.9 y), or adulthood (≥18 y; n = 275 in each group). Weights and heights were categorized into eight age groups between birth and 5.5 y. Control subjects, who had not had a prior long bone fracture were matched with cases for age (within 6 m) and sex.599 matched sets of cases and controls had weight measurements at birth and in at least 2 age groups and 397 matched sets of cases and controls had height measurements in at least 3 age groups. Two optimal weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height trajectory solutions were identified: one sustained above the median (Cluster 1) and one sustained below the median (Cluster 2). Compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age birth size, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) was associated with a reduced risk of fracture (OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.23-0.82). Cluster 1 weight-for-age (OR 1.19; 0.95-1.49), height-for-age (OR 1.20; 0.90-1.60), and weight-for-height (OR 1.06; 0.80-1.41) trajectories were not associated with subsequent fracture vs Cluster 2. The stratified analysis by fracture age group had similar results, but the relationship with SGA was only significant in the childhood group (6-12.9 y).Growth trajectories in the first 5 y of life were not associated with subsequent fracture. SGA infants had a lower fracture risk between 6 and 13 y of age.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

They found that children born smaller than average (known as small-for-gestational-age) had a lower risk of fractures during childhood, between ages 6-13. However, the researchers did not find any link between a child's growth trajectory in the first 5 years of life and their later fracture risk as a teenager or young adult. This suggests that factors beyond just early growth, such as bone density, muscle strength, and physical activity, likely play a role in determining fracture risk over time.

41056330,2026-01-02,Optimizing Event Reporting to Drive a Culture of Learning and Safety: A System-based Approach to Mitigating Harm Through Near-miss and No-harm Reporting.,"Patient safety event reporting systems are essential for identifying potential risks and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional systems frequently face issues of under-reporting, particularly concerning near-miss and no-harm events, thereby limiting opportunities for organizational learning and harm prevention. This initiative used quality improvement principles to design a new reporting system at our institution to enhance safety culture.Following extensive stakeholder feedback and multidisciplinary collaboration, a new system was implemented on July 22, 2022. Key features included streamlined reporting, centralized data analysis, and enhanced transparency.Overall event reporting as well as proportional reporting of near-miss and no-harm events increased significantly from around 60% preimplementation to 80% after implementation. Staff engagement also improved, as shown by a steady rise in the number of unique event reporters and reviewers.The new reporting system has improved reporting overall, with increases in near-miss and no-harm events, along with increased staff engagement with the reporting and review process. Our experience offers practical lessons for institutions seeking to strengthen the learning value of event reporting systems. The principles we identified with simplifying ease of use, integrating into the EHR, improving data transparency, and encouraging greater involvement with event review, along with clear oversight protocols, apply beyond our institution and are not limited to a specific PSRS product or system. These initial outcomes support a culture of safety and bolster organizational learning, with future study needed on long-term effects on patient safety outcomes, staff involvement, and increased trust.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, many of these reporting systems struggle with the problem of underreporting, especially when it comes to ""near-miss"" events (where harm was narrowly avoided) and ""no-harm"" events (where no harm occurred). This can limit opportunities for healthcare organizations to learn from these incidents and take steps to prevent future harm. 

In this study, a team of researchers set out to redesign their institution's patient safety reporting system to address these challenges. They gathered feedback from staff, collaborated across disciplines, and implemented a new system with features like streamlined reporting, centralized data analysis, and improved transparency. After the new system was launched, the researchers found that overall event reporting increased significantly, with a larger proportion of near-miss and no-harm events being reported. Staff engagement also improved, with more people actively participating in the reporting and review process.

Data were collected from the first four US centers utilizing Carpediem. A treatment course was defined as sequential CRRT procedures separated by ≤72 hours. Infant cohorts were categorized by CRRT indication: end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (ie, CRRT as a bridge to peritoneal dialysis) and non-ESKD (all other indications).Sixty-seven infants underwent 93 treatment courses using 1538 filters and 112 vascular access catheters. The primary indication for CRRT was ESKD in 36 (54%) and acute kidney injury in 43%. Median age at first treatment was 18 (IQR: 6, 81) days, and dry weight was 2.6 (IQR: 2.4, 3.1) kg for the ESKD cohort and 32 (IQR: 9, 90) days and 3.4 (IQR: 3.2, 4.5) kg for the non-ESKD cohort. Median treatment course duration was 12 (IQR: 3, 24) days for ESKD compared with 4 (IQR: 1, 13) days for non-ESKD infants. Survival for hospital discharge was 67% in ESKD and 60% in non-ESKD.In this US cohort study, CRRT survival in infants treated with Carpediem exceeds 60%.

41056011,2026-01-02,SLC26A1 directs sulfate homeostasis in health and disease.,"Sulfate is essential for the sulfation of proteoglycans to maintain cell function. The mechanisms regulating the 'ins and outs' of systemic sulfate balance remain incompletely understood. SLC26A1 is an anion exchanger expressed in the kidney. It has recently been identified as a key regulator of plasma sulfate homeostasis in humans. This review summarizes current insights into SLC26A1 function and its role in human diseases.Slc26a1-knockout mouse models exhibit reduced plasma sulfate and abnormal sulfate and oxalate homeostasis, accompanied by augmented susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced liver injury and kidney stone disease, although findings on oxalate homeostasis are inconsistent. In humans, rare and common SLC26A1 variants are associated with hyposulfatemia, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and, in some cases, nephrolithiasis. Functional assays confirm disrupted sulfate and oxalate transport of damaging variants. However, the knockout mouse models have been incompletely characterized, and few patients with damaging SLC26A1 variants have been characterized regarding sulfate and oxalate homeostasis and associated diseases.SLC26A1 emerges as a key regulator of sulfate homeostasis, with potential roles in hepatic detoxification, skeletal integrity, and kidney stone disease. Additional mouse models with tissue-specific gene deletion are needed to delineate the role of SLC26A1 in sulfate and oxalate homeostasis as well as disease pathogenesis. Identification of additional patients with damaging variants in SLC26A1 as well as larger population studies may help to elucidate causal relationships of SLC26A1 activity with clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Many patients initially present to hospitals without surgical or vascular capabilities and require interhospital transfer. The clinical impact of such transfers on treatment and outcomes in AMI remains poorly defined.We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2019 to 2021) to evaluate the association between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients with AMI. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients were categorized by transfer status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with in-hospital mortality and procedural interventions, adjusting for age and comorbidity burden.Of 39,690 hospitalizations for AMI, 14.6% involved interhospital transfer. Transferred patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more often treated at rural or micropolitan hospitals. They were significantly more likely to undergo major surgical and vascular procedures, including bowel resection (odds ratio [OR] 3.48), mesenteric bypass (OR 3.32), and angioplasty (OR 2.66; all p < 0.0001). Markers of critical illness, such as intubation (OR 2.15) and dialysis (OR 1.30), were also more frequent in this group. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among transferred patients (OR 2.05), and transfer remained independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity burden (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.10).Interhospital transfer in AMI is strongly associated with increased clinical severity and in-hospital mortality.

Recognizing the need for guidance, international multi-professional experts convened at the first Reirradiation Collaborative Group (ReCOG) Meeting. This report presents results from a survey on best practices, challenges, and knowledge gaps among experts on thoracic reirradiation.A comprehensive 50-question survey was developed by experts and discussed within the thoracic focus group at ReCOG. It included questions on participant demographics and clinical experience, patient-related clinical conditions and selection, imaging and targets, treatment planning, and dose accumulation. Participants were asked for perceived challenges as well as gaps in knowledge.The survey was completed by 34/51 invited experts (67 % response rate). Most respondents (79 %) were experienced physicists and radiation oncologists (>10 years) primarily at university hospitals (65 %). The most common tumors treated were locally recurrent lung cancer, mediastinal nodes, or thoracic metastases. Reirradiation goals included prolonging local control and survival, and alleviating/preventing symptoms. Conditions precluding reirradiation were persistent grade 3+ toxicity and progressive disease. Major toxicity concerns were bleeding, airway injury/fistula, and esophageal ulceration/fistula. Technical practices varied with regards to image registration, dose accumulation and recovery factors. Advanced treatment planning techniques and IGRT were consistent amongst respondents. Major challenges included lack of clinical guidelines and lack of software support tools.Thoracic reirradiation is an increasingly prevalent area of interest despite scarcity of prospective data. The major focus currently still is primarily on treatment-related factors and the question of how to combine reirradiation with systemic therapy. However, there is little guidance on whether and how to modify a planned reirradiation dose based on patient comorbidities or recovery from the prior radiation course.

Postoperative morbidity (22% vs. 21%; p = 0.925) and 90 day mortality (1% vs. 2%; p = 0.666) were similar in major resections. In CS patients, median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were shorter (mOS: 10.1 vs. 12.5 years, p = 0.035; mPFS: 1.6 vs. 2.4 years, p = 0.015). In subgroups with extensive tumor burden, CS was linked to shorter mOS (9.2 vs. 15.3 years, p = 0.028). Post-progression, 50% of CS patients and 41% of initially non-functional sbNETLM developed secondary CS, increasing the risk of carcinoid heart disease and mortality from cardiac and renal failure. CS was the strongest liver metastasis-specific predictor of mortality in multivariable regression analysis (HR 1.73, p = 0.004).While surgical risk is not elevated, long-term survival is reduced in CS. Secondary CS can develop after tumor progression, even in initially non-functional sbNETLM, further worsening prognosis. Regular screening and proactive management of CS may improve long-term outcomes.© 2025.

They found that patients with carcinoid syndrome tended to have more and larger liver tumors, requiring more extensive surgeries. However, the risk of complications or death shortly after surgery was similar between the two groups. Importantly, the researchers discovered that patients with carcinoid syndrome had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival times compared to those without the syndrome. This was especially true for patients with a high tumor burden. The study also showed that carcinoid syndrome could develop later, even in patients who did not have it initially, further worsening their prognosis.

However, evaluation of TRBC1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for distinguishing mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sezary syndrome (SS) from reactive inflammatory infiltrates in skin is incomplete. We evaluated the utility of a novel dual TRBC1-CD3 IHC stain in skin biopsies with MF/SS (n=40), reactive (n=24), or atypical T-cell infiltrates indeterminant for MF/SS (n=9). Twenty of 24 reactive cases showed clear polytypic TRBC1 expression (median percent TRBC1 positivity among CD3-positive T cells [%TRBC1+] 50% in dermis, 42.5% in epidermis among all cases), while 34/40 MF/SS were clearly monotypic (%TRBC1+ either ≤20% or ≥85%) (sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 91.7%, positive predictive value 94.4%, negative predictive value 78.6%). Discordance between TRBC1 expression and diagnosis was associated with few neoplastic/monotypic T cells and/or lack of physical separation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic populations. Among patch/plaque MF/SS, TRBC1 showed similar diagnostic sensitivity (80.0% vs. 86.7%) and high categorical correlation (monotypic vs. not monotypic, 80%) with TCR gene rearrangement results. TRBC1 interpretation was reproducible, with ≥2/3 and 3/3 pathologists rendering identical interpretations in 100% and 86% of cases, respectively, after independent review and 100% agreement following collective review. Digital image analysis confirmed visual %TRBC1+ accuracy ( r =0.9749, P <0.0001). On the basis of these results, we propose %TRBC1+ cutoffs of <25% or >75% for establishing T-cell monotypia in skin. Considering such thresholds, TRBC1-CD3 evaluation facilitated diagnostic refinement in 7/9 (78%) atypical cases. Overall, TRBC1-CD3 IHC clearly and rapidly aids diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell proliferations.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since then, several smaller case series have been published; however, our understanding of them continues to be quite limited given their rarity. We herein studied 18 additional cases, the largest series to date. Eighteen tumors present in 9 male, 8 female, and 1 nonbinary patient with a median age of 35 years (range: 11 to 70 y) and involved the neck (5), the chest region (4), thigh (3), back (1), shoulder (1), forehead (1), lower leg (1), axilla (1), and the parapharyngeal region (1). Clinical follow-up (9/18 tumors; 50%; median: 10 mo; range: 4 to 40 mo) showed consistent indolent behavior without local recurrences or distant metastases. On morphology, these tumors were characterized by well-circumscription and distinctive peripheral crescent-shaped vessels. They were composed of uniform spindle and round cells growing in short fascicles within often densely hyalinized collagen lacking significant mitotic activity, necrosis, or cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemically, about half of the tested tumors expressed focal to rarely diffuse S100 with occasional co-expression of SOX10. Interestingly, almost half of the tested cases also showed complete loss of RB expression. All but 1 tumor harbored a PRRX1::NCOA1 fusion, while 1 case harbored a novel PRRX1::EP300 fusion. We herein provide additional data on these exceptionally uncommon tumors, expand their molecular spectrum, and compare them to their close morphologic mimics to aid in accurate diagnosis and avoid confusion with potentially more aggressive neoplasms.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers looked at people who were treated with a combination of two medications: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which helps regulate the immune system, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which block certain inflammatory signals. 

The researchers conducted a retrospective study, meaning they reviewed medical records of patients who had already received these treatments. They wanted to see how often blood clots, known as venous thromboembolisms, occurred in this group compared to patients who only received IVIG without JAK inhibitors. 

The results showed that patients taking the combination therapy had a higher risk of developing blood clots, especially in the first few months of treatment. This is an important finding, as blood clots can be serious and even life-threatening. The researchers suggest that doctors closely monitor patients on this combination therapy and consider ways to reduce the clotting risk, such as prescribing blood thinners.

40865784,2026-01-02,Taken for Granted: An Analysis of Sternal Closure Techniques.,"Median sternotomy remains the most common incision in cardiac surgery, but sternal closure differs drastically between surgeons and institutions. Because sternal wound infections carry an incidence between 0.2% and 6%, with mortality approaching 40%, meticulous sternal closure is imperative to reduce the surgical contribution to infection. Reconnecting the central thoracic support point is not a simple feat considering the sternum experiences physiologic, multidimensional shearing with respiration and movement. Although technique varies (ie, simple-interrupted, figure-of-8, Robicsek technique), sternal wires remain the predominant substrate for closure due to surgeon familiarity, ease of use, cost, speed, and low complication rate. Alternatives to wires (ie, plating, metal bands, polymer bands [ie, ZIPFIX, DePuy Synthes], suture tape (ie, FiberTape, Arthrex, Inc), talons, pins, and bone cement) have failed to gain widespread adoption despite studies indicating superiority in stability, pain, postoperative complications, and mortality.

41108621,2026-01-02,Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage With RUNX1 Mutations Show Similar Prognosis Compared to Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RUNX1 Mutations: A Study From the Bone Marrow Pathology Group.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) 5th Edition and International Consensus Classification (ICC) have continued to delineate more genetically defined acute leukemias. Both recognize genetic aberrations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) as defining MDS-related AML (AML-MR). Mutations in RUNX1 are included in this category in the ICC, but not WHO. The current classifications are unclear on how acute leukemias with ambiguous lineage (ALAL), including those of mixed lineage (MPAL) and those without a defined lineage (AUL), should be categorized in the presence of such mutations. Our multi-institutional study aims to determine the significance of RUNX1 mutation in ALAL compared to de novo AML. Newly diagnosed MPAL, AUL, and AML with RUNX1 mutations were collected. ALAL with MDS-related cytogenetics, BCR::ABL1, KMT2A rearrangements, or ZNF384 or BCL11b abnormalities were excluded. We analyzed 17 cases of ALAL and 71 cases of AML that met inclusion criteria. ALAL-RUNX1 and AML-RUNX1 showed overlapping mutational landscapes with frequent comutations in MDS-associated genes. No ALAL-RUNX1 or AML-RUNX1 cases showed concomitant TP53 mutation. ALAL-RUNX1 had more bone marrow blasts and more karyotypic abnormalities; however, neither impacted survival, nor did RUNX1 variant allele frequency (VAF). Survival analysis revealed similarly poor outcomes between them. AML-directed therapies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant trended toward improved survival in ALAL-RUNX1; however, it did not reach significance. Our results suggest ALAL-RUNX1 is associated with younger age, higher blasts, and more karyotypic abnormalities, but has similar clinical and genetic features and outcomes to AML-RUNX1.

Topic authors used these and other supporting references to summarize current knowledge and arrive at 53 management recommendations, with unanimous consensus based on a Delphi process. These were rated by class (strength of recommendation) and level (quality of evidence) per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association criteria. Eighteen recommendations were class 1 (34%), class 2 in 31 (58%), and class 3 in 4 (8%). Three were level A (6%), 19 (36%) were level B, and 31 (58%) were level C.Current evidence supports prior and new recommendations for the management of CMs, but many reflect moderate classes and low levels, mandating further research to better inform clinical practice.Copyright © 2025 Angioma Alliance.

Accurately staging this cancer is crucial for guiding treatment and improving patient outcomes. This research paper examines recent updates to the international guidelines for staging endometrial cancer, known as the FIGO classification. The key change is the integration of molecular profiling, which can provide more detailed information about the cancer's characteristics and risk level. 

The researchers reviewed these new FIGO guidelines and analyzed how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to align with the updated staging system. MRI is an important tool for evaluating the extent of endometrial cancer, including how deeply it has invaded the uterine muscle (myometrium). The researchers found that standardized MRI protocols, especially using contrast-enhanced imaging, can enhance the accuracy of staging and guide optimal treatment planning. 

This research is significant because the refined FIGO classification, combined with advanced MRI techniques, allows for more personalized and effective management of endometrial cancer. By incorporating molecular data and improving imaging assessment, healthcare providers can better determine the appropriate surgical and therapeutic strategies for each patient, ultimately leading to improved outcomes.

40562277,2026-01-02,IL-6 trans-Signaling Regulates Neutrophilic Inflammation in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis.,"Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure characterized by intrahepatic neutrophilic inflammation. In hepatocytes, IL-6 signals through either membrane-bound (classical signaling) or soluble (trans-signaling; TS) IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) to regulate liver injury responses. This study investigated the role of IL-6TS in the pathophysiology of AH. RNA sequencing of liver biopsies from patients with alcohol-related liver disease demonstrated a progressive decline in IL-6R expression correlating with increasing AH severity. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 emerged as the most potent negative regulator of IL-6R expression. Notably, STAT3-dependent gene expression was increased in severe AH. In vitro, treatment of HepG2 cells with TGF-β1 suppressed IL-6R expression. Subsequent treatment with either IL-6 to stimulate classical signaling, or hyper-IL-6, a recombinant IL-6/IL-6R α peptide, to activate trans-signaling activated STAT3. Hyper-IL-6, but not IL-6, restored STAT3 activation in the face of suppressed IL-6R. RNA sequencing of hyper-IL-6 stimulated cells identified a gene signature that stratified a subset of AH patients with: i) enhanced IL-6TS activity, ii) increased intrahepatic neutrophilic infiltration, and iii) transcriptional enrichment of leukocyte migration pathways. Female mice treated with 10-day chronic-plus-binge ethanol exhibited enhanced STAT3 activation despite reduced hepatic IL-6R expression, leading to increased expression of neutrophilic activators, with colocalization of Ly6G+ leukocytes and STAT3+ hepatocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-6TS preserves hepatocyte STAT3-dependent gene expression and promotes neutrophilic inflammation in AH.Copyright © 2026 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

This study investigated how a protein called IL-6 contributes to the inflammation seen in AH. The researchers analyzed liver samples from patients with AH and found that levels of the receptor that binds to IL-6 decreased as the disease worsened. They discovered that a different protein, TGF-β1, was responsible for reducing this receptor. Without the receptor, IL-6 could still activate certain genes in liver cells through an alternate pathway called trans-signaling. This led to increased production of chemicals that attract inflammatory cells called neutrophils to the liver. Experiments in mice confirmed that chronic alcohol exposure activated this IL-6 trans-signaling pathway, even as receptor levels declined, resulting in more neutrophil infiltration and liver inflammation. These findings suggest that the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway plays a key role in driving the harmful inflammation seen in AH. Understanding this process could lead to new treatments that target this pathway and help reduce the severe complications of this liver disease.",,

NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, and understanding the genetic changes that drive its growth is crucial for developing new treatments. 

The researchers analyzed tissue samples from NSCLC patients who had undergone surgery to remove their tumors. They focused on a particular mutation in the KRAS gene, called KRAS G12C, which is found in about 13% of NSCLC cases. By comparing the KRAS G12C tumors to other NSCLC tumors without this mutation, the team aimed to uncover any unique characteristics or behaviors of this specific genetic change.

The key finding was that KRAS G12C NSCLC tumors did indeed differ from other NSCLC tumors in important ways. Patients with the KRAS G12C mutation tended to be younger and have more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The KRAS G12C tumors also exhibited distinct patterns of growth and spread within the lungs.

Data regarding optimal timing of PDA closure are scarce. We therefore decided to compare morbidity and mortality of early and late device closure in preterm infants.MethodsHospitalizations of 166,583 newborn infants diagnosed with PDA were identified from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) in 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019. Of these, 299 preterm infants (gestational age (GA) ≤32 weeks, birth weight <1500 grams) underwent percutaneous PDA closure. Characteristics and periprocedural outcomes were compared between early (≤30 days) (n = 120) and late PDA closure (>30 days) (n = 179).ResultsMean age (±standard deviation) for early PDA closure was 18.6 days ± 7 and 67.3 days ± 36.5 in late PDA closure. Comorbidities including respiratory distress syndrome/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in mortality or referral for surgical ligation between early and late closure. Postprocedural vascular complications were low, but higher in patients with early PDA closure (3.3% vs 0%; p = 0.025). While the total length of hospital stay was longer in late PDA closure group (121.1 days ± 51.7 vs 81.5 days ± 48.8; p = <0.01), postprocedural length of stay was paradoxically longer in the early closure group (69 days ± 43.6 vs 57.5 days ± 43, p = 0.03).ConclusionThere was no statistical difference in in-hospital mortality; however, there is a trend toward higher mortality in the early closure group.

Many preterm babies are born with a condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), where a blood vessel that's supposed to close after birth remains open. This can cause health problems, so doctors often perform a procedure to close the PDA. The researchers compared outcomes for infants who had this procedure done early (within 30 days of birth) versus later (after 30 days). They analyzed data on over 300 preterm infants who underwent the PDA closure procedure. The results showed no significant differences in mortality or major complications between the early and late closure groups. However, infants who had the procedure done earlier were more likely to experience vascular complications like blood clots. While the total hospital stay was longer for the late closure group, the time between the procedure and discharge was actually longer for the early closure group. Overall, this suggests the timing of PDA closure may not greatly impact in-hospital outcomes, but earlier closure carries a slightly higher risk of certain complications. These findings can help doctors and families make more informed decisions about the optimal timing for this common heart procedure in preterm infants.",,

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness, range of motion (ROM), and complication rates between open and arthroscopic release in patients with PTES.The Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were utilized to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on surgical treatment for PTES. Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, and Scopus from their inception to January 2024. A total of 3,278 records were screened, of which 99 studies on the adult population were included. Outcome variables were changes in the ROM, visual analog scale score, Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and complication rate. Surgical techniques were grouped as arthroscopic, open arthrolysis, and open arthrolysis with external fixator.ROM, visual analog scale, and Mayo Elbow Performance Index improved in patients with PTES after all surgical techniques. Open arthrolysis with external fixation had the highest ROM improvement but also the highest rate of nerve injury. Other variables did not show statistically significant differences among the modalities.Since the overall results of open and arthroscopic arthrolysis for PTES are comparable, the surgeon's expertise and the patient's condition are more important factors to consider when choosing a surgical technique over another.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Additional studies characterizing the impact of SDOH on patients undergoing spine surgery are needed. Accordingly, this study evaluates the impact of SDOH on severity of symptoms at presentation and discharge disposition in patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy.A retrospective single-center study identified adult patients undergoing surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy between 2016 and 2020. Cohort characteristics were collected from patient medical records. The t -test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and χ 2 tests were used to compare variables when appropriate. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted for modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) and discharge disposition. All statistical analysis was performed in MATLAB R2022b (MathWorks, Natick, MA).A total of 480 patients were included in the study with a male predominance of n = 281 (59%) and a mean age of 62 ± 13 years. Racial demographics included 64% White (n = 308) and 36% Non-White (n = 172) patients. On univariable analysis, mJOA at presentation was significantly associated with employment status ( P < .01), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), and insurance status ( P = .03). On multivariable analysis, annual income and education level continued to be significant predictors of presenting mJOA. On univariable analysis, discharge disposition was associated with body mass index ( P = .01), mJOA at presentation ( P < .01), employment status ( P = .05), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), insurance ( P < .01), approach ( P < .01), and length of stay ( P < .01).

They also reviewed the various methods for delivering gene therapies to the heart, as well as the current challenges and limitations in this field. Overall, the researchers believe that gene therapy holds great promise as a transformative treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, which could significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease globally. However, further research and clinical trials are still needed to fully realize the potential of this innovative approach.",,

Constipation is associated with poor quality-of-life (QoL). However, the contribution of individual symptoms to QoL is unknown.Bowel symptoms (questionnaires and 2-week bowel diaries), somatic symptom scores (range, 0-4), and bowel symptom-related QoL were evaluated in healthy women and women with constipation in the community and clinic.The bowel variables were significantly correlated and not significantly different between the first and second weeks of the diary. Agreement between bowel symptoms assessed with questionnaires and diaries was significant (P < .001) but varied among symptoms. Of 73 participants who reported 0 to 2 stools/week on questionnaires, 63 (86%) recorded more frequent stools in a diary. Among participants with frequent (≥25% of the time) hard stools, straining, and incomplete evacuation on a questionnaire, respectively 32%, 49%, and 23% recorded these symptoms less frequently in a diary. Only 116 of 222 participants (52%) satisfied constipation criteria by questionnaires and diaries; the remainder satisfied either questionnaire or diary criteria. Stool form, excessive straining, incomplete evacuation, and somatic symptoms were independently associated with poor QoL. Each unit increase in the somatic symptom score was associated with an increased odds of poor QoL (odds ratio, 5.31; 95% confidence interval, 4.54-6.08).Disparities exist between bowel symptoms recorded with questionnaires and diaries. Bowel diaries characterize constipation symptoms in a refined manner; only 52% of participants satisfied constipation symptom criteria on both instruments.

Constipation is a common digestive issue that can significantly impact a person's quality of life, but there is still uncertainty around the best way to accurately measure and understand these symptoms. 

The researchers evaluated bowel habits, symptom severity, and quality of life in both healthy women and women with constipation, using both questionnaires and 2-week diaries. They found that while the questionnaires and diaries were generally correlated, there were notable discrepancies - for example, many participants reported fewer bowel movements on the questionnaires than they actually recorded in their diaries. Only about half of participants met the criteria for constipation on both the questionnaires and diaries. The study also showed that factors like straining, incomplete evacuation, and overall physical symptoms had a bigger impact on quality of life than just the frequency of bowel movements.

These findings suggest that bowel diaries may provide a more nuanced and accurate picture of constipation symptoms compared to standard questionnaires. This has important implications for how constipation is assesse",,

Verrucous carcinoma is a slow-growing, wart-like form of cancer that is distinct from the more common types of esophageal cancer. Understanding this condition is important because it can be difficult to diagnose and may require specialized treatment. 

In this study, the researchers reviewed medical records to identify and analyze cases of verrucous carcinoma of the esophagus. They looked at factors like the patients' symptoms, how the cancer was detected, and how it was treated. The key finding was that verrucous carcinoma often presents with symptoms like difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and coughing, but can be mistaken for other, more benign conditions. Accurate diagnosis typically requires specialized imaging tests and biopsy procedures. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancerous growth, though radiation therapy may also be used in some cases.

40626591,2026-01-02,Site Reviewer Perspectives on Implementation of Commission on Cancer Operative Standards.,"To reduce technical variation in cancer surgery, the Commission on Cancer (CoC) recently implemented 6 operative standards as part of its national cancer center accreditation process. CoC sites are evaluated for compliance with these standards through scheduled visits conducted by trained site reviewers. We characterized site reviewers' perspectives on the implementation of the operative standards.Twenty interviews were conducted with CoC site reviewers using a semistructured interview guide based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Themes were identified using thematic analysis mapped to the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.Site reviewers viewed the operative standards as an effective starting point for improving technical quality and were optimistic the standards would lead to positive change. Compliance was associated with supportive site leadership, effective interdisciplinary communication, and the availability of adequate personnel and institutional resources. In contrast, resistance from surgeons was identified as a key barrier. CoC site reviewers interpret their role as extending beyond assessing compliance, viewing themselves as advocates, educators, and partners to the sites.Overall, CoC site reviewers perceive the operative standards favorably. To enhance implementation of the operative standards, efforts should focus on modifiable institutional and individual-level factors, such as leadership support and surgeon engagement. Additionally, the multifaceted role of the site reviewers presents a valuable opportunity to improve compliance by formalizing the supportive relationship between reviewers and sites.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

About 40% of patients with PSC undergo liver transplantation.The study sought to examine whether liver transplantation modifies risk of colorectal cancer in patients with PSC and IBD.This was a multi-institution retrospective cohort study comparing colon dysplasia/cancer in patients with PSC-IBD who underwent a liver transplantation with those with PSC-IBD without a liver transplant. Our primary outcome was the development of flat or visible colon cancer, low-grade dysplasia, or high-grade dysplasia. Multivariable regression models adjusting for relevant confounders examined effect of liver transplantation on cancer/dysplasia occurrence.Our study cohort consisted of 320 patients with PSC-IBD with a liver transplant compared with 659 PSC-IBD control subjects without a liver transplant. Most (80%) had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 239 (24%) patients developed CRN. On multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, study site, duration of disease, and type of IBD, liver transplantation was associated with a lower risk of colon dysplasia or cancer (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.93). The findings were unchanged on adjusting for number of surveillance exams, chromoendoscopy, or presence of endoscopically active disease.

40339783,2026-01-02,Biomechanical effects of different rotator cuff tear conditions and mediolateral offset in lateralized reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System).,"The indications for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) have expanded to include various shoulder pathologies regardless of rotator cuff condition. However, the biomechanical effects of the procedure based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear remain uncertain in medialized rTSA (m-rTSA) and lateralized rTSA (l-rTSA). Furthermore, the necessity of subscapularis repair for l-rTSA has been debated. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the biomechanical characteristics of m-rTSA and l-rTSA based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear and subscapularis repair.Four matched pairs of human cadaveric shoulders were subjected to m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Both m-rTSA and l-rTSA were modeled by adjusting the lateralization offset in a single type of lateralized rTSA (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System; Corentec, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Deltoid and rotator cuff conditions were simulated using specific loads on various muscle segments. Seven rotator cuff conditions were replicated according to the extent of the rotator cuff tear: intact, complete supraspinatus tear, complete supraspinatus tear with a superior half infraspinatus tear, and complete supraspinatus and infraspinatus tear, each with or without subscapularis repair. Deltoid length, for indirect assessment of the risk of acromial or scapular spine stress fracture (ASF), and impingement-free range of motion were measured in m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Joint stability was assessed using the anterior dislocation force; abduction capability was evaluated using the load required for initial and maximal abductions. Joint stability and abduction capability were measured for all combinations of the rTSA type and rotator cuff conditions.L-rTSA, compared with m-rTSA, demonstrated increased deltoid lengths (all P < .05) and decreased impingement-free abduction angles (m-rTSA vs. l-rTSA, 80.2° ± 8.0° vs. 72.6° ± 8.4°; P = .039). Notably, joint stability and abduction capability showed an inverse relationship with the extent of the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05) and were improved by subscapularis repair to the same extent as the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05).The extent of implant lateralization affected deltoid length and impingement-free abduction angle. Joint stability and abduction capability were compromised by more extensive rotator cuff tears, and subscapularis repair might be essential to enhancing biomechanical effectiveness, even in l-rTSA. These biomechanical findings provide insights for optimizing implant lateralization and refining surgical technique selection in rTSA. However, further clinical validation, including comparisons of different rTSA designs, may be necessary to extrapolate the findings on the Coralis implant to other rTSA systems.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Reverse shoulder replacements are an increasingly common treatment for various shoulder problems, even when the rotator cuff is damaged. However, the optimal surgical approach is still being investigated. 

The researchers used cadaver shoulders to simulate different rotator cuff tear patterns and compared the biomechanical outcomes between a more medial versus a more lateral implant position. They found that greater lateralization of the implant increased the length of the deltoid muscle but reduced the range of motion before impingement. Importantly, more extensive rotator cuff tears were associated with reduced joint stability and abduction strength, but these issues could be partially mitigated by repairing the subscapularis muscle. These findings suggest that the extent of the rotator cuff damage and the decision to repair the subscapularis are key considerations when choosing the optimal surgical approach for reverse shoulder replacement.

Two tube potential configurations (70/Sn150 kV and 90/Sn150 kV) were used to scan the phantoms (11 mGy to 41 mGy volume CT dose index). The phantoms were also scanned using the single-source (SS) PCD-CT scan mode at 120 kV and 140 kV tube potential, and on a DS energy-integrating detector (EID) CT (SOMATOM Force, Siemens) for quantitative comparison. CT images (from SS-PCD-CT, DS-PCD-CT, and DS-EID-CT) were reconstructed using a quantitative kernel (Qr40) at a 2-mm section thickness using iterative reconstruction strength 1. Spectral separation was quantified using the dual-energy ratio (DER) of Ca inserts and using mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of Ca mass density obtained from Ca/water material decomposition. To demonstrate clinical feasibility, 4 patients were scanned using DS-PCD-CT under an institutional review board-approved study. Bone edema maps were reconstructed from DS-PCD-CT and compared with the corresponding clinical imaging exam of the same patients (MRI or DS-EID-CT).DS-PCD-CT at 70/Sn150 kV for Ca 100 mg/cc showed the highest mean DER (2.49 and 2.56 at 30 and 40 cm, respectively) among all scan configurations. For the 50-cm phantom at Ca 100 mg/cc, DS-PCD-CT at 90/Sn150 kV showed highest mean DER (1.88), followed by DS-EID-CT at 90/Sn 150 kV (1.87) and SS-PCD-CT at 140 kV (1.78). The MAPE values for DS-PCD-CT were consistently lower across all phantom sizes (MAPE max. of 1.44%) compared to SS-PCD-CT (MAPE max. 3.97%) and DS-EID-CT (MAPE max. 3.68%). Qualitatively, patient images illustrated bone edema depiction on DS-PCD-CT comparable to clinical MR images, and more precise edema depiction compared to DS-EID-CT images at the site of fractures and intramedullary lesions, and with fewer artifacts.DS-PCD-CT showed superior spectral performance for calcium imaging tasks compared to SS-PCD-CT and DS-EID-CT.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Detection of pCCA in PSC when curative action can be taken is challenging. Our aim was to create a deep learning model that analyzed MRI to detect early-stage pCCA and compare its diagnostic performance with expert radiologists.We conducted a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study involving adults with large duct PSC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Senior abdominal radiologists reviewed the images. All patients with pCCA had early-stage cancer and were registered for liver transplantation. We trained a 3D DenseNet-121 model, a form of deep learning, using MRI images and assessed its performance in a separate test cohort. The study included 398 patients (training cohort n=150; test cohort n=248). pCCA was present in 230 individuals (training cohort n=64; test cohort n=166). In the test cohort, the respective performances of the model compared to the radiologists were: sensitivity 87.9% versus 50.0%, p <0.001; specificity 84.1% versus 100.0%, p <0.001; area under receiving operating curve 86.0% versus 75.0%, p <0.001. Even when a mass was absent, the model had a higher sensitivity for pCCA than radiologists (91.6% vs. 50.6%, p <0.001) and maintained good specificity (84.1%).The 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients.

Telehospitalists supported ED clinicians in medical care decisions and facilitated patient disposition. Emergency department length of stay (LOS) and disposition were evaluated, as were hospital LOS, 30-day readmission, and in-hospital mortality. For patients discharged from the ED, 7-day ED readmission and subsequent hospitalization were evaluated.ResultsTelehospitalists discussed 550 ""admit-likely"" patients with ED clinicians: 105 patients (19.1%) discharged from the ED and avoided admission; 322 patients (58.5%) were admitted to local or nearby community hospitals; 123 patients (22.4%) transferred to the tertiary care facility.

The telehospitalists helped ED staff decide which patients needed to be admitted to the hospital and which could safely be sent home. 

The researchers found that this telehospitalist model was effective - 19% of patients were able to be discharged from the ED instead of being admitted, and those admitted to local hospitals had lower readmission rates compared to patients transferred to the main hospital. The telehospitalists were also able to reduce the time patients spent in the ED waiting for a decision on their care. 

This innovative approach helps optimize the use of hospital resources by avoiding unnecessary admissions and getting patients the right level of care more efficiently. It also supports local hospitals and communities by allowing them to manage more patients locally rather than transferring them to a larger facility. While more research is needed, this telehospitalist model shows promise as a way to improve patient care and hospital operations, especially in areas with limited healthcare resources.",,

They found that FSGS recurrence is a common problem, occurring in up to 30% of transplant recipients, and that it can lead to rapid kidney failure if not properly managed. Potential risk factors include the original cause of the FSGS, certain genetic factors, and the body's immune response to the new kidney. Treatment options range from medications to remove harmful proteins in the blood, to plasmapheresis to filter the blood, to the use of rituximab or other immunosuppressant drugs.

39724652,2026-01-02,Lack of progress in cancer-related outcomes after liver transplantation: Mitigating risk and identifying future needs to move this needle.,"Malignancy has a crucial impact on long-term survival after liver transplantation. There have been enhanced early detection rates with refined cancer screening and improved prognosis for many cancer diagnoses in the general population with the advent of targeted anticancer therapies. Similar advancements have not occurred in the transplant population over this same timeframe. Individualized strategies to reduce the risk of cancer are needed in this high-risk population. Strict adherence to screening and surveillance specific to the transplant population is required. Lifestyle modifications and medication management (both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive) that may impact cancer risk and outcome are highlighted here. As more effective anticancer therapies evolve, transplant recipients' access to these agents is paramount to truly impact cancer-related outcomes in this population. With adequate immunosuppression, rejection rates with immunotherapy are lower than previously purported. Prospective studies of immunosuppression modifications needed to minimize rejection and maximize cancer response are ongoing and will reduce the fear from oncology and transplant providers alike, allowing utilization of the most optimal therapy available to the individual.

To date, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment for patients with coronal plane fractures of the lunate, or Lichtman Stage IIIC. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether coronal plane fractures of the lunate in Kienböck disease healed after surgical intervention, and to determine the outcomes after surgical fixation of the lunate compared with treatment with salvage procedures.A retrospective review of 36 patients with Lichtman IIIC Kienböck disease was conducted. Patients were classified into lunate reconstruction (vascularized bone graft [VBG] or non-VBG) or salvage procedures (proximal row carpectomy [PRC] or limited fusion). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain, range of motion, grip strength, and Mayo Wrist Score (MWS) were analyzed. Radiographs and computed tomographic scans were reviewed for Lichtman stage, fracture location, union, modified carpal height ratio, Stahl index, and radioscaphoid angle.Thirteen patients underwent lunate reconstruction, 13 underwent limited fusion, and 10 underwent PRC. The overall union rate was 45% after lunate reconstruction, with average time to union of 7 months. There were no differences in union rates between VBG and non-VBG. All 3 groups experienced improvement in their postoperative grip strength and MWS. There were no statistically significant differences in preoperative to postoperative changes in clinical outcome measures between the 3 cohorts; however, when we compared lunate reconstruction with all patients who underwent salvage procedures (limited carpal fusion and PRC), we noted the latter had improved functional outcomes (P = .019). Four patients (31%) in the reconstruction cohort and 2 patients (8%) in the limited carpal fusion group required reoperation at latest follow-up.Union rate of coronal plane fractures in Kienböck disease remains variable.

40850609,2026-01-02,Partial diaphragm division is associated with decreased ventilator support after open thoracoabdominal aortic repair.,"The most common complications of open thoracoabdominal aortic repair (OTAAR) are respiratory in nature. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative diaphragm management on prolonged postoperative ventilation, pulmonary complications, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing OTAAR.We conducted a retrospective single-institutional review of patients who underwent extent I to V OTAAR between 2013 and 2024. Patients who did not require diaphragm division were excluded. Outcomes were analyzed in two groups based on full circumferential division (FCD) or partial circumferential division (PD). The primary outcome was prolonged ventilation, defined as postoperative ventilator support for >48 hours. Secondary outcomes included early respiratory morbidity, in-hospital mortality, major adverse events, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays. Univariate followed by multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association of extent of diaphragm division with the primary and secondary outcomes.Among 135 patients who underwent OTAAR during the study period, 110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The average patient age was 54 ±14 years, and 77 patients (70%) were male. Most repairs were done for postdissection aneurysms (n = 83 [76%]) requiring extent II thoracoabdominal aortic repair (n = 88 [80%]). Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative variables were similar between the two groups. FCD was performed in 60 patients (54%), and 50 patients (46%) underwent PD. Prolonged ventilation occurred in 25 patients (24%). On univariate analysis, patients who underwent FCD were more likely to have prolonged ventilation as compared with those who underwent PD (32% [n = 18] vs 15% [n = 7]; P = .037). This association persisted on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.8; P = .01). Patients who underwent FCD demonstrated a trend toward higher rates of postoperative pneumonia (35% vs 25%), need for reintubation (16% vs 8%), and ICU readmission (20% vs 10%). No significant differences were seen when comparing in-hospital mortality, length of ICU and hospital stays, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, or renal failure requiring dialysis.PD of the diaphragm is associated with a shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation without any significant impact on mortality or major adverse events.

We hypothesized that adults with COA had increased LA stiffness, and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and impaired aerobic capacity compared to controls, and that LA stiffness index was associated with the presence of these abnormalities in the COA group.In this prospective study, 46 adults with repaired COA and 46 controls underwent exercise echocardiogram with expired gas analysis. LA stiffness was assessed at rest as the quotient for lateral E/e' and LA reservoir strain (E/e'/LARS). Cardiac reserve was assessed by exercise-induced change in LA reservoir strain, right ventricular free wall strain/right ventricular systolic pressure (RV-PA coupling), and cardiac output (CO). Pulmonary congestion was assessed by lung ultrasound.The COA group had higher LA stiffness index (0.47 ± 0.12 vs 0.14 ± 0.09, P < .001), and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity compared to controls. Within the COA group, those with high LA stiffness index (>0.42) had worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity. The correlates of LA stiffness index were high pulsatile left ventricular (LV) afterload, LV hypertrophy, and atrial fibrillation.These data suggest a mechanistic link between LA stiffness, pulmonary congestion, and exercise intolerance among patients with COA, and the correlates of LA stiffness index may provide viable targets for therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in this population.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This suggests that intrathecal hydromorphone could be a promising option to improve pain management and recovery for women undergoing cesarean sections. However, the study had a relatively small number of participants, so further research with larger groups would be needed to confirm these findings and better understand the long-term benefits and risks of this approach. Overall, this study represents an important step in refining pain relief methods for this common surgical procedure, which could ultimately lead to improved outcomes and experiences for new mothers.",,
40816607,2026-01-02,A Randomized Sham-Controlled Phase 2/3 Trial of QPI-1007 for Acute Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.,"Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients > 50 years of age, has no proven therapy. We report the results of a phase 2/3 clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of QPI-1007, a small interfering RNA against the apoptotic protein caspase 2, in participants with acute-onset NAION.International, multicenter, double-masked, sham-controlled randomized trial.Seven hundred twenty-five participants with acute unilateral NAION enrolled within 14 days of visual symptoms.Intravitreal injection of QPI-1007 into the study eye of a single dose, multiple dose, or sham injection. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 5 treatment groups (down to 3 treatment groups after a preplanned interim analysis): 1 intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg, 1 intravitreal injection of 3 mg, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 1.5 mg each, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 3.0 mg each, or sham injection.The primary end points were safety and the proportion of patients losing at least 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between day 1 and month 6. Secondary outcome measures were mean change in BCVA and mean change in visual field (VF) sensitivity from day 1 to month 6.At 6 months, no difference was found in the proportion of participants who lost 15 letters or more of BCVA in the multidose groups compared with the sham group. A subanalysis of participants with baseline BCVA of ≤ 60 letters or fewer (Snellen equivalent, ≤ 20/63) demonstrated a significantly lower proportion losing 10 letters of BCVA (P = 0.045 for the 1.5 mg × 3 group and P = 0.0104 for the 3.0 mg × 3 group) compared to sham. Significant prevention of 7-dB loss of VF mean deviation was seen in participants with ≤ 60 letters or fewer at baseline (P = 0.023). No significant differences were found in the frequency of adverse events between groups other than expected side-effects of intravitreal injection.Intravitreal injection of QPI-1007 in eyes with acute NAION was well tolerated. Although the primary outcome measure was not met, significant effects on preserving vision were observed in the subgroup of participants with baseline BCVA of 20/63 or worse.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.Copyright © 2025 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

ADP-A2AFP is an investigational autologous T-cell therapy with an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).We describe a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial of ADP-A2AFP (NCT03132792) in human leukocyte antigen-eligible participants with AFP-expressing HCC (or other tumor) not amenable to transplant/resection who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused prior systemic therapy. Participants received lymphodepletion chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 20 mg/m2/day for 3 days, or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 4 days) followed by ADP-A2AFP intravenous infusion. Safety evaluation was the primary objective; response per RECIST v1.1 was the key secondary endpoint.Twenty-one participants, 20 with advanced HCC and one with gastric hepatoid carcinoma received ≥1 ADP-A2AFP infusion. All participants experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher adverse event; 52.4% experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher event considered related to ADP-A2AFP treatment. Six participants experienced cytokine release syndrome (grade 1-2: n = 5; grade 4: n = 1). Best overall responses were complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), and stable disease (n = 12); overall response rate was 9.5%. Eight patients had a stable disease duration of ≥16 weeks. Infiltration of ADP-A2AFP TCR and CD8+ T cells was seen in AFP-positive areas of post-treatment tumor samples. A relationship was demonstrated between increased ADP-A2AFP dose and serum AFP reduction in responders.Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell therapy showed a manageable safety profile and preliminary indications of antitumor activity in these previously treated patients.Adoptive T-cell therapy could be a much-needed additional treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinicians and researchers interested in the development of adoptive T-cell therapies for advanced solid tumors will be interested to learn that in this phase I trial, ADP-A2AFP T-cell receptor T-cell therapy was associated with an acceptable benefit-to-risk profile and encouraging antitumor activity, illustrating the treatment potential of adoptive T-cell therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.NCT03132792; first posted 2017-04-08.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

In this early-stage clinical trial, the researchers gave 21 patients a personalized T-cell therapy called ADP-A2AFP. This therapy uses the patients' own immune cells that have been genetically modified to better recognize and attack cancer cells. The patients first received chemotherapy to weaken their immune system, then were infused with the modified T-cells. 

The results showed the therapy had an acceptable safety profile, with some manageable side effects. Encouragingly, 2 patients had their tumors shrink, and 12 others had their disease stabilize for at least 16 weeks.

Disruptions in these pathways can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiencies, which present with a spectrum of clinical features, including congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Biallelic variants in PIGV, a key mannosyltransferase in GPI biosynthesis, cause Hyperphosphatasia with Impaired Intellectual Development Syndrome 1 (HPMRS1), a rare disorder characterized by hyperphosphatasia, seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal MRI findings, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. Fewer than 30 cases have been reported to date. We conducted a case study and literature review; with clinical data obtained from medical records. A 2-year-old female presented with developmental delay, myoclonic epilepsy, hypotonia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Laboratory results showed elevated alkaline phosphatase (899 U/L) and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss and ventriculomegaly. Trio genome sequencing identified two PIGV variants: c.1415T>C-p.(Leu472Pro) and c.524T>C-p.(Leu175Pro). Functional studies using PIGV-knockout HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant PIGV constructs demonstrated reduced GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) expression under weaker promoters, indicating impaired enzymatic activity. We report two novel PIGV variants associated with HPMRS1, emphasizing the value of functional assays in variant interpretation.

In this study, the researchers investigated two novel variants, or mutations, in the PIGV gene found in a 2-year-old girl with developmental delays, seizures, and elevated levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase. Using advanced genetic testing and laboratory experiments, the researchers demonstrated that these PIGV variants impair the enzyme's normal function, leading to the observed clinical symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of measuring alkaline phosphatase levels in patients with seizures that are difficult to treat, as this can help diagnose HPMRS1 and other related disorders.

40796057,2026-01-02,Demonstrating commutability of an existing certified reference material for use with an end-user measurement procedure that was not included in the original commutability assessment.,"Commutability assessment of a certified reference material (CRM) intended for use as a secondary calibrator should be performed by the CRM producer at the time the material is originally prepared. Assessment typically includes several in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) measurement procedures (MPs) in common use in medical laboratories. Due to logistical constraints, it is usually not possible to include all existing IVD-MPs in a commutability assessment. In addition, a new IVD-MP (IVD-MPn) may be introduced into the market after a commutability assessment was performed for a given CRM. Here we provide a recommendation how to assess commutability of an existing CRM for use with an IVD-MPn that was not included in the original commutability assessment. The study design follows the same principles as a full commutability assessment, but it includes only the IVD-MPn and fewer additional comparator MP(s) for which the CRM's commutability with clinical samples was previously demonstrated. When no reference measurement procedure (RMP) is available, or when the logistics make an RMP difficult to use, other IVD-MP(s) that were part of the original commutability assessment for the CRM should be used as comparator MP(s). When selecting a comparator IVD-MP, its performance must be carefully considered and its selectivity for the measurand should be equivalent to that of the IVD-MPn. The CRM should have had negligible noncommutability bias with the comparator IVD-MP in the original commutability assessment. When the existing CRM meets the commutability criterion for IVD-MPn, the CRM can be used in the calibration hierarchy of the IVD-MPn.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

When a new medical test is developed, it needs to be calibrated using a standardized reference material. However, it's not always possible for the reference material producer to test the material with every new test that comes on the market.

The researchers used a step-by-step process to evaluate whether an existing certified reference material could be used with a new medical test that wasn't part of the original assessment. This involved comparing the results from the new test to results from other medical tests that had already been shown to work well with the reference material. By demonstrating that the reference material produces consistent, reliable results across multiple tests, the researchers were able to confirm that it can be used to calibrate the new test as well.

The impact of this on oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescription fills and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not known.Using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data from 2016 to 2018, we evaluated OAC prescription fills in patients with AF by assessing their proportion of days covered on OAC before, during, and after their coverage gap. Hazard of stroke was assessed for patients who entered the coverage gap before entering, while in, and after exiting, the gap.Patients who entered the coverage gap had a 16% decrease in median proportion of days covered from pregap (0.92 [interquartile range 0.80, 0.97]) to in-gap (0.76 [0.41, 0.98]).

The registry captures comprehensive patient demographics, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes, including complications, readmissions, and reoperations within 30 and 90 days. Additionally, the ASR incorporates Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) such as PROMIS, VR-12, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess functional recovery.Between January 1, 2020, and June 27, 2023, the ASR Cervical Module (N=45,013) was dominated by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF, 64.0%), followed by instrumentation (30.6%) and posterior fusion (22.4%). The Lumbar Module (N=184,682) most frequently included transforaminal/posterior lumbar interbody fusion (32.3%), posterior disc laminectomy (29.5%), and posterolateral fusion (29.2%). Overall reoperation rates were 5.8% in the cervical group versus 10.4% in the lumbar group, with ""Other"" causes (eg, infection, wound-related complication, pain) accounting for a larger share in lumbar (8.1%) than cervical (4.6%). Notably, adjacent segment disease (ASD) was also more common in lumbar patients (1.4% vs 0.1%). For timing of reoperation, a greater proportion of lumbar patients underwent reoperation within both the short-term (≤30 days: 3.6% vs 2.6%) and long-term (>90 days: 4.7% vs 1.8%) intervals.The ASR represents a critical advancement in spine surgery data collection, providing valuable insights into practice patterns, outcomes, and opportunities for quality improvement.

However, the mechanisms by which fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols drive IBS pathophysiology are unclear.Patients with Rome IV diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) underwent barrier function evaluation pre- and post-LFD along with assessment of mast cell number and activation profile. Finally, fecal supernatants (FS) were administered intracolonically to wild-type mice with and without pharmacologic inhibition, toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-/- mice, and mast cell-deficient mice with/without mast cell reconstitution.Of 42 patients, 34 responded to the LFD and 8 did not. Patients with IBS-D had significant improvement in colonic barrier structure and function, mast cell number, and levels of mast cell mediators post-LFD. The magnitude of physiological changes did not correlate with the magnitude of clinical response. Humanization of germ-free mice with pre-LFD feces caused barrier dysfunction and post-LFD feces did not. Similarly, pre-LFD FS caused barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice, whereas post-LFD FS did not. Lipopolysaccharide removal and TLR4 antagonism reversed pre-LFD IBS FS-induced barrier dysfunction. Barrier dysfunction was absent in tlr4-/- mice treated with pre-LFD FS. Similarly, pre-LFD IBS FS did not cause barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice treated with mast cell stabilizer or in mast cell-deficient mice. However, barrier dysfunction was inducible in mast cell-deficient mice upon reconstitution with wild-type mast cells, but not tlr4-/- mast cells.Patients with IBS-D exhibited improvement in colonic barrier dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post LFD. Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols-mediated barrier dysfunction in IBS-D is mediated by direct activation of the TLR4 receptor on colonic mast cells by fecal lipopolysaccharide.gov, Number: NCT04542018.Copyright © 2026 The Authors.

The researchers looked at how this diet affects the gut barrier function and mast cell activation (a type of immune cell) in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. They found that the low-FODMAP diet led to significant improvements in the structure and function of the gut barrier, as well as reduced mast cell numbers and activation. Importantly, the researchers were able to show that the gut bacteria and bacterial byproducts from before the diet change were responsible for causing gut barrier dysfunction, and that this effect was mediated through the activation of mast cells. This suggests that the low-FODMAP diet works by reducing the levels of these problematic bacterial byproducts, thereby improving gut barrier function and reducing mast cell-driven inflammation. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms behind how dietary changes can benefit patients with IBS, and may lead to the development of more targeted treatments for this common and often debilitating condition.",,
40738195,2026-01-02,Heterogeneity in HeartMate 3 implanting center infection management reveals opportunities for quality improvement and best practice initiatives during left ventricular assist device support.,"There is marked variability in device-related (DR) infection frequencies across HeartMate 3 (HM3) centers. The goal is to correlate center driveline (DL) management and infection mitigation practices with DR-infection development, laying foundation for development of best practice recommendations for one facet of HM3 patient care.Coordinators at 30 HM3 centers were surveyed about center practices for infection prophylaxis, intraoperative DL placement and postoperative care, and infection mitigation. Early (≤90 days) and late (>90 day) center DR-infection frequencies were calculated from Society of Thoracic Surgeons Intermacs data linkage. Correlations between center practice patterns and incident DR-infection were examined with multivariable Cox modeling (clustering adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]).Within Intermacs (3,725 patients), 1-year freedom from DR-infection was 87% (80.6-87.3%). Initially, DL dressing changes were performed daily, weekly, and variably at 48%, 21% and 31% of centers. After 4 weeks, 57% deescalated dressing changes to weekly. Chlorhexidine cleanser with a silver-impregnated dressing (Chl-Sil) was standard at 52.7% of programs; 47.3% used chlorhexidine alone or other supplies. Use of Chl-Sil was associated with reduced early (aHR 0.48, p=0.004) and late (aHR 0.64, p=0.02) DR-infection while frequent dressing changes conferred higher late DR-infection (aHR 1.4, p=0.05). Antibiotic prophylaxis, DL tunneling, and diabetes practices did not correlate with DR-infection.Given the burden of DR-infections, best practice recommendations are needed to standardize care. Application of Chl-Sil DL dressings could be a first step in achieving care standardization, while frequent dressing changes following DL incorporation should be avoided.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Cognitive ergonomics refers to the design of tools, environments, and processes to support the mental abilities of healthcare workers and improve patient safety. The authors, who are part of the Society of Surgical Ergonomics, argue that optimizing the cognitive ergonomics of surgery can lead to ""sharper minds and safer surgeries.""

The paper provides a perspective on how factors like information overload, distractions, and poor workflow design can negatively impact a surgeon's focus, decision-making, and overall performance. The researchers review studies demonstrating how simple changes, such as reducing unnecessary alerts or improving display layouts, can enhance a surgeon's cognitive capacity and reduce the risk of medical errors. 

These findings have important implications for patient care. By prioritizing cognitive ergonomics, hospitals can create operating room environments that better support surgeons' mental processes, leading to fewer mistakes and improved surgical outcomes. This is especially crucial as medical technology becomes more complex and surgeons face growing cognitive demands. While more research is needed, this paper makes a compelling case for integrating cognitive ergonomics principles into the design and management of surgical workflows an",,
40715769,2026-01-02,Understanding the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescence from a brain and behavioral developmental perspective.,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is common among teenagers. Adolescence is a transitional period marked by critical brain changes, coinciding with major changes in how teenagers regulate emotions and impulses, as well as in how they understand themselves and interact with others. We review neuroimaging evidence supporting a developmental conceptualization of suicide risk, focusing on neural changes associated with key developmental tasks of adolescence. Functional and structural imaging studies have implicated medial prefrontal, cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and frontolimbic circuitry changes in youth with STBs. There is emerging evidence that psychotherapeutic and neuromodulatory interventions can engage these brain processes and modify behavior in at-risk youth. We argue that harnessing these techniques more specifically by using targeted approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation, impulse control, positive identity development, and healthy social functioning is a promising way forward for reducing suicide risk in teens. Continued investigation into neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence is critical for developing more effective risk assessment and treatment approaches to aid suicidal youth in navigating adolescent development and transitioning successfully to adulthood.© 2025.

During adolescence, the brain and behavior go through critical changes that can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This research paper examines how these developmental changes in the brain may contribute to the emergence of suicidal tendencies in youth. 

The researchers reviewed brain imaging studies that looked at differences in brain structure and function between teenagers with and without suicidal thoughts or behaviors. They found that several brain regions involved in regulating emotions, controlling impulses, and understanding oneself and social interactions showed changes associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents. This suggests that the typical brain development during this transitional period may play a key role in the increased suicide risk seen in teens.

The findings indicate that targeted interventions, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation techniques, which can modify these brain processes, may be a promising approach to reducing suicide risk in young people. Further research is needed to fully understand the neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence, which could lead to more effective ways to identify and support youth at risk of suicide as they navigate this critical developmental stage and transition into adulthood.",,
40712932,2026-01-02,Enhancement of Inpatient Mortality Prognostication With Machine Learning in a Prospective Global Cohort of Patients With Cirrhosis With External Validation.,"Cirrhosis is a major global burden requiring frequent hospitalizations and has high inpatient mortality. Traditional prognostic tools focused on inpatient mortality are affected by global disparities, which impacts timely management. We aimed to deploy machine learning (ML) approaches to enhance inpatient mortality prognostication.Using the prospective Chronic Liver Disease Evolution and Registry for Events and Decompensation (CLEARED) cohort, which enrolled inpatients with cirrhosis globally, we used admission-day data to predict inpatient mortality with ML approaches vs logistic regression. Internal validation (75/25 split) and subdivision using World Bank income status (low/low-middle-income countries, upper-middle income countries, and high-income countries) were performed. The ML model with the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was externally validated in a US veteran inpatient population with cirrhosis.The CLEARED cohort included 7239 inpatients with cirrhosis (64% were men; mean [SD] age, 56 [13] years; median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 25) from 115 centers globally; 22.5% were from low/low-middle-income countries, 41% were from upper-middle-income countries, and 34% were from high-income countries; 11.1% of patients (n = 808) died in the hospital. Random forest (RF) showed the best AUROC (0.815) with high calibration, which was significantly better vs parametric logistic regression and LASSO models (AUROC, 0.774; P < .001 and AUROC, 0.787; P = .004, respectively). RF was the ML method with the highest AUROC and remained better than logistic regression, regardless of country income level (high-income countries: AUROC, 0.806; upper middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.867; and low/low-middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.768). External validation was performed in 28,670 veterans (96% were men, mean [SD] age, 67.8 [10.3] years, median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 15) with 4% (n = 1158) inpatient mortality. The AUROC using the CLEARED-derived RF model was 0.859.RF analysis trained on a global prospective cirrhosis cohort enhances mortality prediction over traditional methods, was consistent across country income levels, and was successfully validated externally in a US veteran population.Published by Elsevier Inc.",Gastroenterology,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Scott Silvey|Patrick S Kamath|Jacob George|Ashok Choudhury|Qing Xie|Mark Topazian|Hailemichael D Mekonnen|Zhujun Cao|Aabha Nagral|K R Reddy|Danielle Adebayo|Sumeet K Asrani|Neil Rajoriya|Marco Arrese|Sevda Aghayeva|Mithun Sharma|Sarai G Huezo|Adrian Gadano|Hasan B Yapici|Nabil Debzi|Jawaid Shaw|Somaya Albhaisi|José L Pérez Hernández|Yingling Wang|Feng Peng|Linlin Wei|C E Eapen|Hiang K Tan|James Y Fung|Ruveena Rajaram|Kessarin Thanapirom|Haydar Adanır|Adam Doyle|Shalimar|Minghua Su|Dinesh Jothimani|Yijing Cai|Rene M Velazquez|Wei Wang|Michael Gounder|Cameron Gofton|Sezgin Barutcu|Busra Haktaniyan|Alberto Q Farias|Aloysious D Aravinthan|Chinmay Bera|Surender Singh|Peter C Hayes|Ramazan Idilman|Aldo Torre|Mario R Alvares-da-Silva|Wai-Kay K Seto|Florence Wong|Brian J Bush|Leroy R Thacker|Nilang Patel|Jasmohan S Bajaj,Patrick S Kamath,"School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.|The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, North South Wales, Australia.|Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Delhi, India.|Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.|St Paul's Hospital, Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.|Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, India.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, United Kingdom.|Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.|University Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.|Pontificia Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan.|Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, India.|Centro Médico ISSEMYM, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.|Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.|Mustapha Bacha University Hospital of Algiers, Algiers, Algeria.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Hospital General de México Eduardo Licaga, Mexico City, Mexico.|The Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou, Suzhou, China.|The Second XiangYa Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.|Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.|Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.|Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.|The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.|Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.|All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.|Rela Institute, Chennai, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.|Instituto de la Salud Digestiva, Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico.|The Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei, China.|Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.|Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.|Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.|University of Sao Paolo, Sao Paolo, Brazil.|School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.|University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Research, Lucknow, India.|Division of Health Sciences, Deanery of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.|School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.

Cirrhosis is a major global health problem, often requiring hospital stays, and has high mortality rates. Traditional methods for predicting inpatient death have limitations, especially in different countries and income levels. 

The researchers used a large international dataset of over 7,000 hospitalized cirrhosis patients to train a machine learning model to predict inpatient mortality. This model performed significantly better than standard statistical methods, accurately predicting death 82% of the time. Importantly, the machine learning approach maintained its high accuracy regardless of the patient's country or income level. The model was then successfully validated in a separate group of over 28,000 U.S. veterans with cirrhosis.

This research demonstrates that advanced machine learning can enhance doctors' ability to identify high-risk cirrhosis patients early in their hospital stay, which could lead to more timely and effective treatment. The global, diverse dataset used to develop the model also suggests it may be useful for predicting outcomes in cirrhosis patients worldwide, helping address disparities in care.

40692167,2026-01-02,What Is the Appropriate Sample Size in Human Cadaveric Studies? A Quantitative Review of 770 Articles.,"Determining an appropriate sample size in human cadaveric studies remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. Unlike other basic science fields, anatomical research is constrained by factors such as limited human donor availability, cultural considerations, and ethical restrictions. Despite these limitations, researchers are often asked to justify sample sizes, yet no standardized guidelines currently exist. To quantitatively assess sample sizes in recent human cadaveric studies and propose evidence-based recommendations for future research, a PubMed search was conducted on February 26, 2024, using the term human cadaveric study. The articles published in 2023 and 2024 were screened, yielding 770 eligible studies. Data extracted included the total sample size, number of classified groups, and journal impact factor (IF). Descriptive statistics, linear regression, and correlation analyses were performed. Continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). The median sample size was 11.5 (IQR: 7-20), and 47.9% of studies used 10 or fewer specimens. The median number of classified groups was 3 (IQR: 2-4). Linear regression showed that studies dividing specimens into 2-6 groups often failed to meet the recommended sample size per group based on regression modeling. No significant correlation was found between sample size and journal IF (r = -0.062, p = 0.115). Most cadaveric studies rely on small sample sizes due to inherent constraints, yet many still attempt a subgroup analysis without sufficient statistical power. Although flexibility is essential in anatomical research, we recommend a minimum total sample size of 10 for basic studies and at least five samples per group for those involving classification. Cadaveric sample size alone does not predict journal impact, highlighting the importance of methodological rigor over quantity.© 2025 The Author(s).

The primary endpoints were the rate of local pathological complete response (negative in-field biopsy) and the incidence, type, and severity of adverse events by 12 mo. The secondary endpoints included PSA kinetics, changes in prostate volume, retreatment, and urinary/sexual function.Of the 121 patients treated with IRE, the negative in-field biopsy rate at 12 mo was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62%, 79%). The secondary endpoint of negative in-field biopsy rate defined by the Delphi consensus criterion was 84% (95% CI: 76%, 90%). The time to median PSA nadir was 3.5 mo, and the median percent reduction in PSA at 6 mo was 68.2%. Urinary function outcomes had a mean change from baseline to 12 mo of 3 in the University of California Los Angeles Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary domain total score and a mean change of -2 in the International Prostate Symptom Score total symptom score.

Prostate cancer is a common cancer that affects many older men, and finding effective treatments is important. The researchers conducted a clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of IRE, which uses electrical pulses to destroy cancer cells in the prostate without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. 

The study included 121 men with prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the prostate gland. The researchers found that 71% of patients had no detectable cancer in the treated area of the prostate 12 months after the IRE procedure. Patients also experienced improvements in urinary function and maintained sexual function. While a small number of patients had serious side effects, overall the treatment appeared safe and well-tolerated.

It is unknown whether incidence varies by race and ethnicity.In a prospective, observational study using active real-time surveillance of electronic health records, we identified 18,838 adults 50 years or older with glycemically defined new-onset diabetes (GNOD). In this interim analysis, we report 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after GNOD (absolute incidence [95% CI]) and associated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) by race and ethnicity, overall 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer adjusting for racial distribution of incident diabetes in the United States, and interval between GNOD and pancreatic cancer diagnosis.During median follow-up of 2.3 years, 82 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed (60% in men; mean [SD] age, 71 [8] years). The 3-year estimates for the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and associated SIR by race and ethnicity were as follows: non-Hispanic White patients (n = 6518): 0.84% (95% CI, 0.60%-1.07%) and 6.4 (95% CI, 4.8-8.4); Hispanic patients (n = 5984): 0.40% (95% CI, 0.20%-0.60%) and 4.2 (95% CI, 2.6-6.3); African American patients (n = 2192): 0.37% (95% CI, 0.07%-0.67%) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0-5.0), and Asian/Pacific Islander patients (n = 3360): 0.22% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.39%) and 3.0 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0). Overall, race-adjusted 3-year pancreatic cancer incidence was 0.62%. On average, GNOD occurred 8 months before clinical diagnosis (0-4 months in 30.5%, 4-12 months in 31.3%, 12-24 months in 19.5%, and 24-36 months in 18.7%).GNOD, identifiable in real time using active surveillance of electronic health records, is associated with a high 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer with marked racial and ethnic differences.

41106048,2026-01-02,Segmental asymmetry and multiplanar motion of the lumbar spine: Cadaveric insights into spinal pathologies.,"The lumbar spine plays a critical role in supporting multiplanar motion and distributing loads during daily activities. While global spinal symmetry is often assumed in biomechanical assessments, segmental asymmetries may exist and contribute to conditions such as low back pain (LBP). The present study investigates the multiplanar kinematic behavior and torque asymmetry of the lumbar spine using cadaveric specimens, focusing on identifying segmental asymmetries that may be masked in global motion analysis. A novel experimental setup combining a 6°-of-freedom robotic system with optical metrology was used to apply controlled flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation to human lumbar spines. The metrology system enabled precise, non-contact tracking of vertebral motion in three dimensions, ensuring accurate quantification of segmental kinematics. Symmetrical motion inputs were applied bilaterally during lateral bending and axial rotation, while torque responses were recorded. Segmental range of motion (ROM) and torque asymmetries were quantified in the coronal and axial planes. Despite symmetrical inputs, torque outputs showed asymmetries exceeding 15 % in several specimens. Segmental ROM asymmetries were observed in most vertebrae, sometimes exceeding 40 %, and could vary across planes without consistent correlation. Notably, some spines exhibited segmental asymmetry despite overall torque symmetry, highlighting the limitations of global assessments. These findings underscore the importance of segment-level analysis in spinal biomechanics. Hidden asymmetries may have clinical implications for diagnosing and treating LBP. Spinal pathologies and alignment appear to partially account for subject-specific asymmetries in lateral bending and axial rotation.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used a specialized robotic system and advanced imaging techniques to closely examine the motion and forces in different parts of the lumbar (lower) spine in donated human specimens. The researchers found that even when the same forces were applied evenly to both sides, the individual vertebrae often moved and responded asymmetrically. This segmental asymmetry was sometimes quite substantial, exceeding 40% in some cases, and did not always match the overall symmetry observed in the spine as a whole. These hidden asymmetries could have important implications for diagnosing and treating back problems, as they may not be detected by standard assessments that only look at the spine's global motion.

41110629,2026-01-02,What's New in Membranous Nephropathy and How to Incorporate New Antigen Discoveries Into Clinical Practice: A Review.,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be seen in association with other diseases, including malignancy, drugs, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Over the last decade, great progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, resulting from the discovery of several target antigens by use of laser microdissection/mass spectrometry methodology. This technique has proven to be the most sensitive method available and has the advantage of testing for all the target antigens at one time. The discovery of these target antigens has now shifted the classification of MN from primary versus secondary to classification based on the target antigen identified. Each target antigen has its own specific clinical characteristics and known associated diseases. Identification of the target antigen can help further identify the underlying cause for a more targeted approach in looking for associated diseases. Progress has also been made in the treatment of patients with MN, with more standard risk stratification of the patients and a shift in using anti-CD20 drugs as the first line for those with moderate and high risk of progression.

PSC is a rare disease that causes inflammation and scarring in the bile ducts, which can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Researchers wanted to understand how a person's age and the presence of cirrhosis might impact their risk of developing HCC, a common and deadly form of liver cancer.

The researchers analyzed medical data from a large group of PSC patients to identify factors that increased their chances of getting HCC. They found that older age and the presence of cirrhosis were the two biggest risk factors. Patients over 50 years old were much more likely to develop HCC compared to younger individuals, and those with cirrhosis had an even higher risk. This suggests that regular cancer screening may be especially important for older PSC patients and those who have progressed to cirrhosis. Understanding these risk factors can help doctors monitor high-risk patients more closely and potentially catch any cancers early, when they are most treatable. However, the study was limited to",,

Anthropometric and metabolic data were analyzed.The median age at initiation of topiramate treatment was 10.1 years (range, 7.9-11.2 years) and 64% were boys. At baseline, the median body mass index (BMI) was 149% of the 95th percentile (range, 136%-200%). The median treatment duration was 14 months (interquartile range, 9.5-24 months), with a maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg (range, 50-150 mg). There was a median decrease in BMI% of the 95th percentile of 8% (95% CI, -15 to -1.02; P = .042), and a reduction in BMI z score by 0.37 (95% CI, -0.66 to -0.05; P = .028). The most notable response was in a child with hypothalamic obesity who experienced a 35-point reduction in BMI% of the 95th percentile over 24 months. While 11 of 14 children showed reduction in BMI, 3 had no change or increase in their BMI.

This study looked at the effects of a medication called topiramate on weight and other health measures in young children with severe obesity, including those with obesity caused by problems with the hypothalamus (a part of the brain that regulates weight). The researchers reviewed the medical records of 14 children under 12 years old who were treated with topiramate. They found that on average, the children experienced an 8% decrease in their body mass index (BMI) percentage compared to the 95th percentile for their age and sex, as well as a 0.37 reduction in their BMI z-score, which is a measure that accounts for normal growth. The most dramatic result was seen in a child with hypothalamic obesity, who had a 35-point reduction in BMI percentage over 2 years. While the majority of children saw decreases in BMI, a few did not respond to the medication. Overall, this study suggests that topiramate may be a useful treatment option for managing severe obesity in young children, including those with obesity related to brain development. However,",,
41392688,2026-01-02,Investigation of the Frictional Characteristics of a Manufactured Tendon Lubricant in Canine Peroneus Longus (PL) Tendons In Vitro.,"Tendon adhesion is a major complication following tendon reconstruction surgery in the hand. Previous studies showed that a combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin, covalently bound to the tendon surface, can provide a durable gliding surface to reduce adhesions in animal models both in-vitro and in-vivo. We have developed a similar product using good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, in preparation for use in humans. This study aimed to examine the frictional properties and elastic modulus of the Manufactured Tendon Lubricant (MTL) when applied to an extrasynovial canine peroneus longus (PL) tendon in-vitro. Twenty PL tendons along with the 2nd and 5th digits from adult canine forepaws, were obtained (mean age: 12 months, weight: 35 kg) from animals sacrificed in Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols. Tendons were treated either with the MTL or saline solution, as a control. Eight tendons from each group (MTL vs saline-treated) underwent friction testing, using a previously described protocol, followed by indentation testing to assess tendon elastic modulus (a marker of successful crosslinking). Two tendons from each group were not tested and were sent for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MTL group had significantly (p < 0.001) lower friction and gliding resistance as well as higher elastic modulus of the PL tendons, compared to the saline group. This study demonstrates that MTL provides lubricating effects and fixation to the tendon surface and may be suitable for human testing.© 2025 Orthopaedic Research Society.",J Orthop Res,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ahmadreza Nezameslami, Ramona Reisdorf, Dirk Larson, Chunfeng Zhao, Peter Amadio",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41392688/,"Tendon injuries and scarring are common problems following hand surgery, leading to reduced mobility and function.

The MTL-treated tendons showed significantly less friction and greater elasticity compared to the control group. This suggests the lubricant can provide a smooth, durable surface to reduce scarring and improve tendon movement after surgery. The findings are promising for developing new treatments to improve outcomes for patients undergoing hand or other tendon repair procedures. While this was an initial lab study, the researchers plan to further test the lubricant's safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials. Limitations include the small sample size and use of animal rather than human tendons, so more research is needed to confirm the results.

MS is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects the central nervous system, causing a wide range of symptoms like vision problems, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairment. The researchers aimed to identify ways to diagnose MS earlier and develop more effective treatments to halt the progression of the disease. 

The paper examines emerging technologies and research approaches that could revolutionize MS care over the next few years. For example, new imaging techniques may allow doctors to detect the earliest signs of MS before significant nerve damage occurs, leading to quicker diagnoses. Additionally, researchers are exploring novel drug therapies that could stop the immune system from attacking the nervous system, the underlying cause of MS. If successful, these treatments could prevent further disability and improve quality of life for millions of MS patients worldwide.

41384706,2026-01-02,Pathology of adrenal tumours: recent advances.,"Changes in the nomenclature and classification of adrenal gland diseases are the result of advances in understanding the pathogenesis, germline susceptibility and the clonal-neoplastic nature of diseases of the adrenal gland. Although numerous classification systems have been proposed, the Weiss system remains the standard for distinguishing benign from malignant adult adrenal cortical tumours, but the Helsinki system and the reticulin algorithm are proving to be increasingly useful in difficult cases. Subtypes of adrenal cortical neoplasms, such as myxoid and oncocytic, as well as those occurring in children require special consideration as their classification systems are different from those for standard adult adrenal cortical neoplasms. The importance of proliferative activity is central to the evaluation of adrenal cortical neoplasms. As for primary unilateral aldosteronism, CYP11B2 immunostain is increasingly studied to identify sites of aldosterone production with the hope of finding staining patterns predictive of clinical outcomes. Awareness of the clonal-neoplastic nature of adrenal cortical nodules and underlying germline susceptibilities has also advanced the classification of adrenal cortical nodular disease.

Although standard RT doses (24 Gy in 12 fractions) provide excellent disease control, they are associated with toxicity. Emerging evidence suggests that lower RT doses may maintain efficacy while reducing toxicity; however, prior prospective randomized attempts to reduce the dose to 4 Gy in 2 fractions have demonstrated inferior disease control. This phase 2 randomized trial aims to determine whether reduced-dose hypofractionated RT can achieve comparable disease control while minimizing toxicity and treatment burden. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive experimental arm treatment with 8 to 10 Gy in 2 to 5 fractions or standard of care treatment with 24 Gy in 12 fractions.

Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities. Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT) measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework - MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual back-propagation graph for deconfounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC: 0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively.

However, more research is still needed to fully understand the underlying causes and optimal treatments. This study represents an important step forward in improving care for the relatively small number of people affected by this rare disorder.",,
41358582,2026-01-02,Dual Targeting of Extramedullary Myeloma with Talquetamab and Teclistamab.,"Patients with plasmacytomas that are noncontiguous with bone marrow (true extramedullary myeloma) are at high risk for disease progression or relapse. Phase 1 of the RedirecTT-1 study showed promising efficacy with dual-antigen targeting of myeloma with talquetamab (anti-G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D) plus teclistamab (anti-B-cell maturation antigen) in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including those with true extramedullary myeloma.In this phase 2 study, we investigated talquetamab plus teclistamab exclusively in patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma. The primary end point was overall response, evaluated with the use of functional imaging. Secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study and received treatment (median follow-up, 12.6 months). A response occurred in 79% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 87). Among the patients with a response, the percentage with a response duration of at least 12 months was 64% (95% CI, 48 to 76). At 12 months, progression-free survival was 61% (95% CI, 50 to 71), and overall survival was 74% (95% CI, 63 to 83). Common adverse events of any grade included oral symptoms, such as dysgeusia, dry mouth, and dysphagia (in 87% of the patients); cytokine release syndrome (in 78%); and nonrash skin effects (in 69%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (most commonly hematologic events) occurred in 76% of the patients; 31% had grade 3 or 4 infection. A nonfatal adverse event led to discontinuation of one or both agents in 6% of the patients. Among 10 deaths that occurred during follow-up, 5 were due to infection and 5 were considered to be related to the study treatment.Most patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma had a response with talquetamab plus teclistamab. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was high and was consistent with previous observations for each agent as monotherapy.

Patients with multiple myeloma that has spread outside the bone marrow (called extramedullary myeloma) often have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The researchers tested a combination of two experimental drugs, talquetamab and teclistamab, in 90 patients with advanced, drug-resistant extramedullary myeloma. 

The results showed that the drug combination was effective, with 79% of patients responding to the treatment. Among those who responded, 64% maintained their response for at least 12 months. The treatment also appeared to slow disease progression, with 61% of patients remaining progression-free at 12 months. However, the therapy did have significant side effects, including oral symptoms, immune system reactions, and infections, which led some patients to discontinue the treatment.

These findings suggest that dual targeting of extramedullary myeloma with talquetamab and teclistamab could be a promising new approach for patients with this difficult-to-treat form of multiple myeloma. While the side effects will nee",,
41344792,2026-01-02,"Quantifying the fatal and non-fatal burden of disease associated with child growth failure, 2000-2023: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Child growth failure (CGF), which includes underweight, wasting, and stunting, is among the factors most strongly associated with mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Poor height and bodyweight gain arise from a variety of biological and sociodemographic factors and are associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to estimate CGF prevalence, the risk of infectious diseases associated with CGF, and the disease mortality, morbidity, and overall burden associated with CGF.In this analysis we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific (diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and measles) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and mortality associated with stunting, wasting, underweight, and CGF in aggregate. We combined the burden associated with mild, moderate, and severe forms of CGF: stunting was defined as height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) less than -1, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) less than -1, and wasting was defined as weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) less than -1, according to WHO Child Growth Standards. Population-level continuous distributions of HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ were estimated for 2000 to 2023 using data from surveys, literature, and individual-level study data. The risk of incidence of, and mortality due to, diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles was separately estimated in a meta-regression framework from longitudinal cohort data for Z scores less than -1. Finally, fatal outcomes associated with these diseases were estimated with vital registration, verbal autopsy, and case-fatality data, while non-fatal outcomes were estimated with surveys as well as health-care utilisation and case reporting data. The exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates were from continuous distributions, allowing for direct assessment of the attributable fractions for mild, moderate, and severe stunting, underweight, wasting, and the combined impact of child growth failure within populations. All estimates were age-specific, sex-specific, geography-specific, and year-specific.We estimated that, in children younger than 5 years in 2023, CGF was associated with 79·4 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 47·0-106) DALYs lost and 880 000 (517 000-1 170 000) deaths. This represented 17·9% (10·6-23·8) of 444 million (434-457) total under-5 DALYs and 18·8% (11·1-25·0) of all 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) under-5 deaths. Compared to stunting (33·0 million [24·1-42·2] DALYs, 373 000 [272 000-477 000] deaths) and wasting (39·2 million [23·8-53·0] DALYs, 428 000 [256 000-583 000] deaths), childhood underweight was associated with the largest share of CGF-related disease burden: 52·2 million (21·9-75·1) DALYs and 573 000 (236 000-824 000) deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2023.CGF remains a leading factor associated with death and disability in children younger than 5 years, despite global attention and focused interventions to reduce the prevalence of associated CGF indicators. Our findings underscore the need for policies, strategies, and interventions that focus on all indicators of CGF to reduce its associated health burden.Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

The researchers used data from a large global health study to estimate the prevalence of different types of child growth failure, including stunting (low height), wasting (low weight), and underweight. They also calculated the increased risk of infectious diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia associated with growth failure, as well as the overall burden in terms of lives lost and years of healthy life lost due to these conditions. 

The study found that in 2023, child growth failure was linked to 79.4 million years of healthy life lost and 880,000 deaths in children under 5 years old globally. This represents nearly 18% of all health problems and deaths in this age group. Underweight was the biggest contributor, responsible for over half the total burden. These findings highlight the immense toll that poor childhood growth and nutrition takes on global health, despite efforts to address the problem. Tackling all aspects of child growth failure through policies, programs, and interventions will be crucial to reducing this preventable source of illness and mortality, especially in low-resource settings.",,
41344348,2026-01-02,"Electronic health record-facilitated symptom surveillance and collaborative care intervention in oncology (E2C2): a cluster-randomised, population-level, stepped-wedge, pragmatic trial.","Patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) surveillance and collaborative care improve cancer symptom control. However, human resource requirements constrain their implementation and reach. Electronic health record (EHR) facilitation reduces resource needs and might allow population-level scaling. We aimed to assess the effect of EHR facilitation of PROM-directed collaborative care on clinical and health services outcomes.E2C2 was a cohort cluster-randomised, unblinded, stepped-wedge, pragmatic trial, in which we randomly assigned 15 clusters of medical oncology and haematology clinics in the USA sharing a common EHR, Epic, to five sequences to compare an intervention of remotely delivered electronic PROM (ePROM) symptom surveillance and EHR-facilitated collaborative care (ECC) management with a usual care (UC) control of ePROM surveillance alone. Sequences transitioned from the UC control to the ECC intervention state at 8-month intervals. All adult (aged ≥18 years) patients who received medical oncology or haematology care in a US multi-state health system were enrolled. All cancer stages, cancer types, and treatment phases were included, except for patients enrolled in hospice or with acute leukaemia. SPPADE symptoms (sleep interference, pain, impaired physical function, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit or fatigue) were assessed with 0-10-point numerical rating scales linked to clinical encounters. The prespecified co-primary outcomes were all post-baseline SPPADE scores, and clinically actionable scores (≥4/10), among participants who completed at least two ePROMs. The outcomes were assessed using multivariate regression of cluster-period mean SPPADE symptom scores against intervention exposure, baseline SPPADE scores, fixed-cluster, and secular time effects. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03892967) and is now closed to recruitment.From March 28, 2019, to Jan 31, 2023, 50 207 patients were enrolled and administered ePROMs in association with oncology or haematology visits. In the analytical cohort of 24 874 participants, 10 390 (42%) were assigned ePROMS in both the ECC and UC periods. Of the 19 084 [77%] in the ECC group, 11 138 (58%) were female, 7946 (42%) were male, and 18189 (95%) were White; and of the 16 180 (65%) in the UC group, 9621 (60%) were female, 6559 (40%) were male, and 15468 (96%) were White. 21 153 (85%) participants reported one or more clinically actionable symptoms (defined as SPPADE score ≥4/10). In multivariate analyses, mean population joint SPPADE symptom burden favoured ECC periods (p=0·0055) with adjusted mean differences of -0·12 (95% CI -0·19 to -0·05) for anxiety, -0·08 (-0·15 to -0·01) for depression, -0·06 (-0·16 to 0·03) for fatigue, -0·04 (-0·14 to 0·07) for pain, 0·03 (-0·07 to 0·14) for physical function, and -0·07 (-0·16 to 0·02) for sleep. ECC benefit was also noted following actionable scores (p<0·0001) with adjusted mean differences of -0·10 (-0·17 to -0·03) for anxiety, -0·09 (-0·16 to -0·02) for depression, -0·09 (-0·18 to -0·01) for fatigue, 0·04 (-0·05 to 0·12) for pain, 0·07 (-0·03 to 0·17) for physical function, and -0·02 (-0·10 to 0·07) for sleep.Centralised EHR-facilitated, symptom surveillance and collaborative care management are more beneficial than symptom surveillance alone in reducing the population burden of SPPADE symptoms in oncology patients.US National Institutes of Health.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers wanted to see if using electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor patient-reported symptoms, and then providing personalized care plans, could lead to better symptom control compared to just monitoring symptoms alone.

The study involved 15 cancer clinics across the United States, with some clinics starting the new EHR-facilitated symptom monitoring and care program right away, while others continued with the standard symptom monitoring approach. Over 50,000 cancer patients participated, reporting on symptoms like pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. The researchers then analyzed the symptom scores between the two groups.

The results showed that the EHR-facilitated program led to meaningful reductions in symptom burden across the population of cancer patients. Patients in the EHR-facilitated group had lower average symptom scores and were less likely to have severe, actionable symptoms compared to those receiving standard care. This suggests that using technology to enhance symptom monitoring and provide personalized care can significantly improve the quality of life for cancer patients.

The primary topic highlights the significance of accurately diagnosing these lesions to enhance patient outcomes and management strategies.The study reviews of the role of AI in differentiating choroidal melanocytic lesions, particularly choroidal nevi from small melanomas, examining clinical and imaging risk factors. It explores deep learning (DL) applications for image classification and assesses AI's potential impact on patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and regulatory concerns in ocular oncology.To achieve this, the methods discussed in this paper revolve around employing DL techniques, which utilize artificial neural networks to analyze high-dimensional medical images. This approach enables automated classification and image analysis of ophthalmic data, allowing for the identification of intricate patterns and features that may be imperceptible to clinicians. Additionally, the text reviews existing clinical and imaging risk factors associated with the growth of choroidal nevi into melanoma, leveraging this information to inform and enhance AI algorithms.The anticipated results of integrating AI into clinical practice include increased diagnostic accuracy, which can lead to earlier identification of high-risk lesions and, consequently, timely interventions. This proactive approach has the potential to improve patient care significantly by facilitating better management strategies, thus enhancing patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence may also uncover subtle imaging features that would otherwise be overlooked, providing a more comprehensive assessment of lesions.In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in ocular oncology, advocating for its integration with existing imaging technologies. While AI offers promising advancements in diagnostic practices and patient care, the paper also acknowledges the necessity of addressing regulatory and implementation challenges to fully harness these benefits. Overall, the incorporation of AI technologies into the diagnostic workflow has the potential to not only save vision but also improve survival rates, marking a significant step forward in the management of choroidal melanocytic lesions.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.Crown Copyright © 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Ophthalmologyé.",Ophthalmology science,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Lamis Alharby|Edward Korot|Pearse A Keane|Sara E Lally|Sandor Ferenczy|Lauren A Dalvin|Marco Pellegrini|Jay Duker|Adrian T Fung|Swathi Kaliki|Kaan Gunduz|Minoru Furuta|Antonio Yaghy|Carol Shields|Prithvi Mruthyunjaya|Mandeep S Sagoo,Lauren A Dalvin,"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Luigi Sacco Hospital - University of Milan, Milan, Italy.|Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts.|The University of Sydney and Macquarie University Hospital, Sydney, Australia.|The Operation Eyesight Universal Institute for Eye Cancer, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India.|University of Ankara, Ankara, Turkey.|Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima City, Japan & Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford, California.","Lamis Alharby, Edward Korot, Pearse A Keane, Sara E Lally, Sandor Ferenczy, Lauren A Dalvin, Marco Pellegrini, Jay Duker, Adrian T Fung, Swathi Kaliki, Kaan Gunduz, Minoru Furuta, Antonio Yaghy, Carol Shields, Prithvi Mruthyunjaya, Mandeep S Sagoo",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41341795/,"This research explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors better diagnose a type of eye cancer called choroidal melanoma. Choroidal melanoma starts in the layer of the eye called the choroid, and it can be difficult to distinguish from a less serious condition called a choroidal nevus. Accurately diagnosing these conditions is crucial, as choroidal melanoma requires prompt treatment to save the patient's vision and life. 

The researchers used a type of AI called deep learning, which analyzes medical images to identify complex patterns that may be missed by the human eye. They trained the AI system on images of choroidal nevi and small melanomas, teaching it to recognize the subtle differences between the two conditions. The goal was to develop an AI tool that could quickly and accurately differentiate these lesions, allowing doctors to provide the right treatment at the right time.

41321428,2026-01-02,Clinical Insights Into the Mechanistic Crossroads of Lamotrigine and Therapeutic Ketosis in Bipolar Depression.,"There are substantial care gaps in optimizing treatment response for bipolar depression given, at best, a modicum of benefit from antidepressant treatment and, in contrast, a substantial cardiometabolic burden associated with regulatory-approved antipsychotic treatment. Lamotrigine (LGT) is an anticonvulsant with an evidence base in both epilepsy and bipolar disorder (BD), in particular bipolar depression ""stabilizing from down under."" There is a well-established bidirectional relationship between BD and epilepsy. Recognizing the complex interplay between mood, diet, and energy metabolism, lifestyle interventions have emerged as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in BD. Among these, therapeutic ketosis, with century-old evidence base in epilepsy, has regained new interest as a promising adjunctive treatment for mood and metabolic comorbidities. LGT and therapeutic ketosis both target neurobiological pathways that regulate energy metabolism and promote neuronal stability-key processes implicated in mood regulation and neuronal protection. This alignment suggests the possibility of synergistic effects in BD. In this review, we explore the overlapping mechanisms of LGT and therapeutic ketosis and provide clinical insights into their combined use in BD, offering a comprehensive perspective on this innovative treatment strategy.© 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological psychiatry global open science,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Dina N Ali|Iain H Campbell|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,Dina N Ali|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,"Department of Psychiatry & Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Department of Pharmacy Services, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Dina N Ali, Iain H Campbell, Jonathan G Leung, Tamahara Gonzalez Campos, Duan Liu, Mete Ercis, Matej Markota, Deniz Ceylan, Kyla Lara-Breitinger, Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, Adam S Anderson, Aysegul Ozerdem, Stacey J Winham, Mark A Frye",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41321428/,"Bipolar disorder is a challenging mental health condition that can significantly impact a person's mood, energy, and daily functioning. Researchers are exploring new ways to improve treatment for bipolar depression, which can be particularly difficult to manage.

The researchers reviewed existing scientific evidence to understand how lamotrigine and therapeutic ketosis work in the brain and body, and how they might be used together to treat bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug that has shown benefits for stabilizing mood in bipolar disorder, while therapeutic ketosis involves putting the body into a fat-burning state that may have positive effects on brain function and energy metabolism. The researchers found that these two approaches target overlapping biological pathways related to mood regulation and neuronal protection, suggesting they could have a synergistic effect when used in combination.

Epigenetic aging biomarkers, reflecting cellular and tissue aging, have been linked to various age-related pathologies, but their association with MASLD-HCC is unknown. We investigated associations between five epigenetic aging biomarkers and MASLD-HCC risk.We performed whole blood DNA methylation assay (Infinium 850k array) and calculated principal components-based (PC) versions of HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge and GrimAge and the DunedinPACE aging rate. We further calculated relative age accelerations for PCHorvathAge, PCHannumAge, PCPhenoAge and PCGrimAge. The aging biomarkers were modelled as continuous variables and categorised into tertiles based on distributions among controls. Associations between each aging biomarker and MASLD-HCC were examined using logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates.Data on 272 MASLD-HCC cases and 316 cancer-free MASLD controls recruited from six sites and matched on chronological age, sex and study site were analysed. Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.45-3.50; ORcontinuous = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, p = 0.009), PCGrimAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.41-6.64; ORcontinuous = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10-1.24, p = 8.76 × 10-07) and DunedinPACE (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.45, 95% CI: 2.17-5.55; ORcontinuous = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.43-2.10, p = 2.58 × 10-08) were associated with MASLD-HCC, but not PCHorvathAge or PCHannumAge.Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE aging rate are associated with risk of MASLD-HCC.

They measured several epigenetic aging biomarkers, which provide information about how quickly a person's cells are aging compared to their chronological age. The results showed that higher levels of three specific aging biomarkers - PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE - were strongly associated with an increased risk of developing MASLD-related HCC. These findings suggest that measuring these aging biomarkers could help identify MASLD patients at higher risk of liver cancer, allowing for closer monitoring and earlier intervention. However, more research is needed to fully understand how cellular aging processes contribute to the development of MASLD-related liver cancer. Incorporating",,
41297375,2026-01-02,From reporting to relating: Reimagining ePROMs in cancer symptom management.,"Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (ePROMs) are digital tools that allow patients to report symptoms using computers, tablets, or smartphones. In cancer care, ePROMs are increasingly used to monitor SPPADE symptoms: sleep disturbance, pain, physical function decline, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit or fatigue. While ePROMs can support timely symptom recognition and clinical response, their influence on how patients and clinicians connect and understand one another during care remains notably underexplored. This study investigates how the integration of digital symptom reporting into clinical routines may shape both the content of symptom reporting and the relational dynamics between patients and providers. We conducted 46 in-depth interviews with cancer patients enrolled in a multi-year symptom management trial (E2C2) at Mayo Clinic. Using a combination of deductive frame analysis and inductive analysis informed by Boundary Object Theory, we first examined how patients with advanced cancer understood and approached the sharing of SPPADE symptoms. We then explored how ePROM technology shaped their experiences and perceptions of symptom reporting. We found that three interrelated factors shaped patient engagement with ePROMs: (1) personal orientations toward perceiving and expressing symptoms, (2) coping styles, including tensions between appropriate self-monitoring and positive self-presentation, and (3) expectations shaped by prior interactions with the care team. While ePROMs helped patients articulate symptoms, they also raised questions about whether responses were reviewed and how they were interpreted by clinicians. Patients described ePROMs as signaling what kinds of symptoms ""counted"" to providers, subtly reshaping their understanding of illness and their role in managing it. Our findings engage and extend Boundary Object Theory by showing that ePROMs function not only as tools for coordinating information, but also as relational artifacts. Attending to their interpretive and emotional effects highlights new opportunities to design systems that support connection and shared understanding, alongside efficient data flow.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

MASLD is a type of fatty liver disease that can lead to serious health problems if not properly managed. The researchers used a technique called proton density fat fraction (PDFF) to measure the amount of fat in the liver. PDFF is a non-invasive imaging method that can provide detailed information about the liver without the need for a biopsy. 

The study found that PDFF was able to accurately identify patients with MASLD, even in the early stages of the disease. This is important because MASLD can be difficult to diagnose, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The researchers also discovered that PDFF measurements could help distinguish MASLD from other types of liver disease, providing a more accurate diagnosis. 

These findings suggest that PDFF could be a valuable tool for healthcare providers, allowing them to identify MASLD earlier and develop personalized treatment plans for patients. This could lead to better outcomes and improved quality of life for individuals living with this condition.

However, the clinical implication of concurrent -5/5q and TP53 aberrations in MN with ≥5% blasts is poorly understood.Patients with TP53-mutated MN carrying ≥5% blasts assessing the prognostic impact of -5/5q on 24-month overall survival (OS24) were examined.Of 587 patients, 515 (88%) exhibited -5/5q overwhelmingly in the context of a complex karyotype (98.3% vs. 61.1% complex karyotype without -5/5q; p < .0001) and multihit TP53 allelic state (88.3% vs. 56.9%; p < .0001). Proportions of patients with blasts ≥20% were comparable between groups with and without -5/5q; p = 0.26. Notably, patients with -5/5q exhibited significantly fewer coalterations; p < .0001. Looking at outcomes, presence of -5/5q was associated with shorter median 24-month overall survival (7.8 months vs. 11.2 months; pLog-rank = .012), an effect restricted to subgroups with blasts <20% (p = .039; N = 163), absent -7/7q (p = .007; N = 225), or WHO5-defined single hit allelic state (p = 0.030; N = 91). Importantly, -5/5q retained independent adverse prognostic significance regardless of TP53 allelic state in a multivariable model. Furthermore, among the subset of 75 (13%) patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, -5/5q predicted significantly shorter median 5-year posttransplant survival (16.2 months vs. median not reached; pLog-rank = .009).These findings emphasize the independent prognostic relevance of chromosome 5/5q losses underscoring the clinical relevance of cytogenetic testing for -5/5q even in this high-risk cohort.© 2025 The Author(s).

41292096,2026-01-02,Understanding the Periodontitis-Diabetes Linkage: Mechanisms and Evidence.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis share a complex, bidirectional relationship, with each condition exacerbating the other. Diabetes, particularly when poorly controlled, significantly increases the risk, severity, and progression of periodontitis. The biological mechanisms involved are complex and numerous. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is linked to oral microbial dysbiosis, which is in turn associated with increased inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, impaired neutrophil and macrophage function, altered T-cell profiles, and cytokine imbalance, collectively fostering chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Moreover, diabetes alters bone metabolism, promoting osteoclastogenesis and reducing reparative bone regeneration by limiting coupled bone formation through an effect on growth factor production, mesenchymal stems cells, and osteoblasts. Conversely, periodontitis is strongly linked to poor glycemic control. Clinical studies and longitudinal meta-analyses report consistent positive associations, while randomized controlled trials show that periodontal therapy reduces HbA1c by ~0.43%. Emerging evidence suggests that periodontitis and oral preclinical dysbiosis contribute to diabetogenesis, although causality remains uncertain. Periodontitis may drive metabolic dysfunction through several biological mechanisms. The dysbiotic oral microbiome and subsequent periodontitis may promote systemic inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Moreover, oral dysbiosis may deplete nitrate-reducing taxa and impair nitric oxide pathways, which has relevance to both periodontal and cardiometabolic health. Accordingly, periodontal treatment in diabetic populations has shown potential health care savings. Nevertheless, trials assessing the influence of periodontitis treatment on systemic outcomes consistently show significant treatment heterogeneity, which requires explication in future studies. This review underscores the systemic implications of periodontitis in diabetes and highlights the value of integrating periodontal care into diabetes management. A better understanding of the shared pathophysiology between these diseases supports interdisciplinary approaches and points toward novel preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation, microbial balance, and host response modulation to jointly benefit periodontal and cardiometabolic health.",Journal of dental research,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,D T Graves|M A Levine|S Aldosary|R T Demmer,R T Demmer,"Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Division of Epidemiology, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","D T Graves, M A Levine, S Aldosary, R T Demmer",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41292096/,"This research explores the complex relationship between two common health conditions - diabetes and periodontal (gum) disease. Diabetes, especially when poorly managed, significantly increases the risk and severity of gum disease. Conversely, gum disease can also worsen diabetes by making it harder to control blood sugar levels. 

The researchers reviewed the scientific evidence to understand the biological mechanisms behind this two-way connection. They found that high blood sugar in diabetes disrupts the delicate balance of bacteria in the mouth, leading to inflammation and damage to the gums and supporting bone. Diabetes also impairs the immune system's ability to fight gum disease. Conversely, gum disease may contribute to the development of diabetes by promoting systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.

These findings highlight the importance of integrating dental care into the management of diabetes. Treating gum disease in people with diabetes could potentially improve blood sugar control and reduce long-term health complications. However, more research is still needed to fully understand this relationship and develop the most effective prevention and treatment strategies.

41462575,2026-01-02,Senolytic-Resistant Senescent Cells Have a Distinct SASP Profile and Functional Impact: The Path to Developing Senosensitizers.,"The senescent cell (SC) fate is linked to aging, multiple disorders and diseases, and physical dysfunction. Senolytics, agents that selectively eliminate 30%-70% of SCs, act by transiently disabling the senescent cell antiapoptotic pathways (SCAPs), which defend those SCs that are proapoptotic and pro-inflammatory from their own senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consistent with this, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, which attenuates the pro-inflammatory SASP of senescent human preadipocytes, caused them to become ""senolytic-resistant"". Administering senolytics to obese mice selectively decreased the abundance of the subset of SCs that is pro-inflammatory. In cell cultures, the 30%-70% of human senescent preadipocytes or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that are senolytic-resistant (to Dasatinib or Quercetin, respectively) had increased p16INK4a, p21CIP1, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβgal), γH2AX, and proliferative arrest similarly to the total SC population (comprising senolytic-sensitive plus-resistant SCs). However, the SASP of senolytic-resistant SCs entailed less pro-inflammatory/apoptotic factor production, induced less inflammation in non-senescent cells, and was equivalent or richer in growth/fibrotic factors. Senolytic-resistant SCs released less mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and more highly expressed the anti-inflammatory immune evasion signal, glycoprotein non-melanoma-B (GPNMB). Transplanting senolytic-resistant SCs intraperitoneally into younger mice caused less physical dysfunction than transplanting the total SC population. Because Ruxolitinib attenuates SC release of proapoptotic SASP factors, while pathogen-associated molecular pattern factors (PAMPs) can amplify the release of these factors rapidly (acting as ""senosensitizers""), senolytic-resistant and senolytic-sensitive SCs appear to be interconvertible.© 2025 The Author(s).

As we get older, our cells can become ""senescent"" - they stop dividing and start secreting harmful inflammatory compounds. These senescent cells contribute to many age-related problems, from cancer to Alzheimer's disease. 

The researchers investigated a class of drugs called ""senolytics"" that can selectively eliminate senescent cells. However, they found that a subset of senescent cells are resistant to these senolytic drugs. By studying these resistant cells, the researchers discovered that they have a distinct secretory profile - they release fewer inflammatory compounds but more growth and fibrotic factors. Transplanting these resistant senescent cells into younger mice caused less physical dysfunction compared to the overall senescent cell population.

This suggests that there may be ways to ""sensitize"" the resistant senescent cells to make them more vulnerable to senolytic treatments. The researchers propose that drugs that block inflammatory signaling pathways could be used in combination with senolytics to eliminate this resistant senescent cell population. This could lead to more effective therapies to combat the detrimental effects of cellular senescence and promote healthy aging.",,

They were divided into 3 groups: a control group that received only sutures, a TISSEEL group that used a commercially available fibrin sealant patch (TISSEEL) of approximately 0.5 cm2, and a PEP-TISSEEL group that used a similarly sized TISSEEL patch combined with PEP. Autopsies were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 8 weeks after surgery. Analyses were performed using molecular biological, biomechanical, and histological techniques.At 6 weeks, the PEP-TISSEEL group achieved greater failure load (mean, 27.5 ± 5.3 N) than the control (mean, 16.4 ± 4.2 N; P = .012) and TISSEEL (mean, 23.4 ± 5.0 N; P = .041) groups, with superiority persisting at 12 weeks (27.2 ± 6.5 N vs 13.1 ± 2.6 N [P = .002] for the control group and 21.1 ± 5.8 N [P = .037] for the TISSEEL group). DigiGait showed earlier recovery of stride length and paw angle. Histology revealed organized collagen and reduced scarring, while molecular assays demonstrated early inflammatory modulation with subsequent upregulation of collagen type 1 or 3 and TGF-β, supporting accelerated tendon-bone healing.Intraoperative application of PEP-TISSEEL enhanced tendon-bone healing in a rat model by improving biomechanical strength, promoting enthesis-specific histological regeneration, and accelerating functional recovery as evidenced by gait analysis.The intraoperative application of PEP combined with TISSEEL significantly enhances rotator cuff tendon healing by modulating early inflammation, promoting collagen synthesis, and improving biomechanical properties in a rat model.

41475369,2026-01-02,Total elbow arthroplasty for the management of post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures : a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) has shown favourable outcomes in the management of severely comminuted distal humeral fractures in low-demand elderly patients, leading to its increased use in recent years. Less is known about the outcomes of TEA when used for the failure of either internal fixation or conservative management, particularly whether not performing TEA acutely influences the options for further management if fixation fails. This systematic review aimed to assess the clinical and functional outcomes following TEA when used for the post-traumatic sequelae of a distal humeral fracture, and to compare these outcomes with those in patients with a distal humeral fracture who undergo TEA acutely.MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched from January 2000 to September 2024 for studies reporting complications, reoperations, the range of motion of the elbow, or functional outcomes following the use of TEA in the management of the post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures, including those due to failed fixation, nonunion, and post-traumatic arthritis. Demographic and clinical data were collected, descriptive statistics were summarized, and meta-analyses were undertaken to compare the outcomes between salvage and acute TEA.A total of 16 studies were included, with a total of 380 patients who underwent salvage TEA and 251 who underwent TEA as the initial management. Salvage TEA was associated with a significantly higher overall risk of complications (odds ratio (OR) 2.5 (95% CI 1.0 to 5.9)), though the rate of reoperations did not differ from those who underwent TEA acutely (OR 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.4)). Pooled analyses revealed a similar postoperative range of flexion (mean difference (MD) -2.4° (95% CI -9.1 to 4.3)) and extension of the elbow (MD 1.1° (95% CI -2.3 to 4.5)) and pronation (MD 0.0° (95% CI -1.1 to 1.1)) and supination (MD -0.0° (95% CI -1.0 to 0.9)) of the forearm. However, salvage TEA showed significantly inferior functional outcomes, as assessed by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MD 9.7 (95% CI -18.8 to -0.6)).These findings indicate that salvage TEA represents a viable option for the management of post-traumatic sequelae following the teatment of a distal humeral fracture, although patients who underwent salvage TEA had a significantly increased rate of complications and significantly inferior functional outcomes compared with those who underwent TEA acutely.© 2026 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",The bone & joint journal,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Samuel S Rudisill, Daniel Z You, Bradley W Fossum, Shawn W O'Driscoll, Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Mark E Morrey",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475369/,"This research examined the outcomes of a surgical procedure called total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) for patients who had previously suffered a severe fracture of the lower part of the upper arm bone (distal humeral fracture).

We aim to determine the burden and impact of PE in young adults hospitalized with sarcoidosis.This study investigates the prevalence and consequences of PE in young adults aged 18-44 years hospitalized with sarcoidosis using data from the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020) with relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. This study aims to address the primary outcomes of the burden and trends of PE and its associated impact on in-hospital mortality. Additionally, it explores secondary outcomes such as healthcare resource utilization and discharge patterns.Among 50,385 young adults (median age 37 years) hospitalized with sarcoidosis, 1120 had PE, showing a linear increase from 2% in 2016 to 2.9% (P < 0.001) in 2020. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group, predominantly in young blacks, exhibited a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as obesity, smoking, drug use, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism and prior history of venous thrombus embolism. In contrast, the sarcoidosis-PE- group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (with/without chronic complication), hyperlipidemia and chronic pulmonary disease. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for all potential sociodemographic and comorbid variables showed higher odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.24, P < 0.02) in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group as compared to the sarcoidosis-PE- group. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group also had higher hospital costs and length of stay.The higher odds of in-hospital mortality with an increased length of stay and hospital cost observed in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group highlight the often underreported complications of sarcoidosis, particularly in a younger demographic. The relevance of this study stems from its potential to uncover trends that could lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2026 Indian Chest Society.",Lung India : official organ of Indian Chest Society,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Aditi K Bhanushali|Pooja Suchday|Harsh Sura|Jay Patel|Lohithasya C Chunduru|Moulika Kari|Shrikanth Sampath|Giorgi Chilingarashvili|Rupak Desai,Aditi K Bhanushali,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Medicine, GCS Medical College, Hospital and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.|Department of Medicine, Insight Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.|Department of Medicine, BJ Medical College, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.|Department of Medicine, Santhiram Medical College, Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, India.|Department of Medicine, Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Narketpalli, Telangana, India.|Department of Internal Medicine, Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital, Darby, PA, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Independent Researcher, Department of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.","Aditi K Bhanushali, Pooja Suchday, Harsh Sura, Jay Patel, Lohithasya C Chunduru, Moulika Kari, Shrikanth Sampath, Giorgi Chilingarashvili, Rupak Desai",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474429/,"This study examined the prevalence and impact of pulmonary embolism (PE), a dangerous blood clot in the lungs, among young adults hospitalized with sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs.

41474054,2026-01-02,Iodine and bismuth dual-contrast imaging on photon-counting CT with noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic imaging: Phantom and patient studies.,"Dual-contrast imaging of iodine and bismuth has shown promise in previous phantom and animal studies utilizing spectral CT. However, these studies often employed Pepto-Bismol containing bismuth subsalicylate with dosages exceeding the recommended limits for human consumption, limiting their clinical applicability.The purpose of this study was to improve iodine-bismuth dual-contrast imaging on a clinical photon-counting CT (PCCT) system using a noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) approach.Four bismuth samples (0.6, 1.3, 2.5, and 5.1 mg/mL) and three iodine rods (1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg/mL) were inserted into a multi-energy CT phantom and scanned on a PCCT system at 140 kV. VMIs were generated from 40 to 190 keV in 10 keV increments. Iodine and bismuth maps were computed for all possible keV pairs using a generic image-based three-material decomposition method and compared with maps generated from the original low-/high-energy PCCT images. Mass concentrations, noise levels, and individual as well as joint root-mean-square error (RMSE) for iodine and bismuth were measured to determine the optimal keV pair. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of low concentration samples (bismuth: 0.6 and 1.3 mg/mL; iodine: 1.0 mg/mL) were calculated at the optimal keV pair and compared to the values determined with the original PCCT images. In an IRB-approved feasibility study, a research patient was administered two doses of Pepto-Bismol prior to a routine abdomen-pelvis CT scan. Material decomposition was performed using both the original low-/high-energy images and the optimal VMI pair identified in the phantom study. Bismuth signals in the stomach and proximal small bowel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.The VMI pair of 110 and 190 keV was determined to be optimal, achieving the lowest joint RMSE of 0.49 mg/mL, compared to 1.42 mg/mL for the original low-/high-energy pair. It also yielded the highest CNR, representing a 190-318% improvement over the original low/high-energy decomposition. Qualitatively, both phantom and patient studies demonstrated improved iodine-bismuth separation and reduced noise using the optimized VMI pair.These findings suggest that noise-optimized VMI selection can enhance dual-contrast material decomposition performance on clinical PCCT, supporting its potential for translation into gastrointestinal imaging applications.© 2025 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Medical physics,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Sophia Roth|Diwash Thapa|Afrouz Ataei|Vasantha Vasan|Richard W Ahn|Lifeng Yu|Yin Xi|Liqiang Ren,Lifeng Yu,"Department of Radiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Sophia Roth, Diwash Thapa, Afrouz Ataei, Vasantha Vasan, Richard W Ahn, Lifeng Yu, Yin Xi, Liqiang Ren",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474054/,"This medical research explores a new imaging technique that could improve how doctors diagnose and monitor certain gastrointestinal conditions. The researchers tested a special type of CT scan called photon-counting CT, which can detect two different contrast agents - iodine and bismuth - at the same time. Iodine is commonly used to highlight blood vessels and organs, while bismuth is sometimes used to coat the lining of the digestive tract. 

The researchers found that by carefully adjusting the energy levels of the X-rays used in the CT scan, they could get clearer, less noisy images that better differentiate iodine and bismuth. This allowed them to more accurately measure the amounts of each contrast agent present. They tested this approach in a model and then tried it on a real patient who had taken a bismuth-containing medication before their routine CT scan. The results showed the new imaging technique could clearly visualize the bismuth in the patient's digestive system.

This advance could lead to better diagnostic tools for conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, like ulcers or tumors. By combining iodine and bismuth contrast, doctors may be able to get a more",,
41469115,2026-01-02,Efficacy of Magseed Localization for Non-palpable Breast Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Accurate preoperative localization is essential for successful breast-conserving surgery on non-palpable breast lesions. In recent years, Magseed has emerged as a non-wired localization approach with promising outcomes due to its flexibility and precision. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Magseed localization on non-palpable breast lesions.Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. The pooled mean and proportions were analyzed using a random-effects model. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420250654940).From 958 studies screened, 16 studies involving 2,117 patients and 2,176 Magseeds were included. The overall rate of positive margins was 7.6% [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.04, 0.11, I2=88%], and the re-excision rate was 8.2% (95%CI=0.05, 0.12, I2=87%). The overall complication rate was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=7%). The success rate for Magseed placement was 99.3% (95%CI=0.987, 0.998, I2=1%), the migration-related failure was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=0%), and the retrieval success rate was 99.6% (95%CI=0.992, 0.999, I2=0%). The mean operative time was 61.4 min (95%CI=55.9, 66.9, I2=98%).Magseed appears to be a safe and effective technique for the preoperative localization of selected non-palpable breast lesions. Nonetheless, further studies based on breast density, size, and depth are required to investigate the feasibility of preoperative Magseed localization for patients with non-palpable breast lesions.Copyright © 2026 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

AI-powered tools improve lung nodule detection, radiomics-based risk stratification, and bronchoscopic navigation. Machine learning (ML) algorithms aid in lung cancer screening by analyzing imaging data, reducing false positives, and improving early diagnosis. AI-driven robotic-assisted bronchoscopy enhances navigation and biopsy accuracy, particularly for peripheral lung lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and cytopathology benefit from AI's ability to assess lymph node malignancy and optimize rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). AI applications extend to phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and identifying candidates for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR). Deep learning (DL) models analyze computed tomography (CT) imaging and spirometry data to optimize patient selection. AI-driven algorithms are also advancing pleural effusion detection, differentiation, and classification, supporting clinical decision-making. Education and research in IP are also transforming with AI-driven simulation, virtual reality, and automated assessment tools that enhance procedural training and competency evaluation. The integration of AI into clinical work and procedural training accelerates advancements while presenting challenges in ethical AI implementation, data security, and bias mitigation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in IP will expand, improving procedural efficiency, personalizing treatment plans, and optimizing patient selection for interventions. Future developments will focus on refining AI-driven predictive analytics, enhancing robotic-assisted procedures, and integrating AI seamlessly into clinical workflows.

MGUS is a relatively common condition where abnormal proteins called monoclonal proteins are detected in the blood, but without any associated symptoms or disease. While MGUS itself is not dangerous, it can sometimes progress into more serious blood cancers like multiple myeloma. 

The researchers in this study reviewed the current scientific understanding of MGUS, including how it is diagnosed, what factors influence its progression, and how patients should be monitored over time. They found that MGUS is quite prevalent, affecting around 3-4% of adults over age 50.

It often requires repeated treatment with silver nitrate using a speculum to access the neovagina. This study evaluates whether adding betamethasone suppositories to silver nitrate treatment improves the resolution of hypergranulation tissue after PIV.A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who received supplemental betamethasone suppositories in addition to silver nitrate treatment (betamethasone group) between 01/2023 and 12/2024 and matched to a cohort of patients treated with silver nitrate alone (silver nitrate group). Outcomes, number of treatments, and severity of hypergranulation tissue were compared using t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.There were 16 patients in each group, with similar average follow-up times: 8.5 ± 5.5 months (silver nitrate group) and 7.8 ± 4.7 months (betamethasone group) (P = 0.70). At the most recent follow-up, moderate and severe hypergranulation resolved more often in the betamethasone group (86%, 50%) than in the silver nitrate group (60%, 25%). Patients in the betamethasone group with moderate or severe hypergranulation tissue required fewer median treatments for resolution (2 vs 3.5 and 4 vs 5, respectively). After excluding cases that required cauterization under anesthesia, patients in the betamethasone group were significantly more likely to have resolution of their hypergranulation tissue compared to patients in the silver nitrate group (P = 0.035).Betamethasone is an effective addition to silver nitrate for the treatment of hypergranulation tissue, with our results indicating it can improve resolution and lessen treatment burden in patients' post-PIV.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A common complication of this surgery is the development of excess granulation tissue, called hypergranulation, which can be difficult to treat. This study investigated whether adding a steroid medication, betamethasone, to the standard silver nitrate treatment could improve the resolution of this complication.

The researchers conducted a retrospective review, comparing a group of patients who received both betamethasone suppositories and silver nitrate treatment to a matched group who received silver nitrate alone. They found that the betamethasone group had better resolution of moderate and severe hypergranulation, requiring fewer treatments on average to achieve this. Even when excluding cases that required more invasive cauterization, the betamethasone group was significantly more likely to have their hypergranulation tissue fully resolve.

These results suggest that the addition of betamethasone can be an effective way to improve outcomes for patients experiencing hypergranulation after penile inversion vaginoplasty. This could help reduce the treatment burden and discomfort for these patients. While the study was limited by its retrospective design",,
41460132,2026-01-02,The Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric for penetrating keratoplasty.,"Irreversible corneal blindness disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries where there remains a critical demand for surgeons skilled in corneal transplantation. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) is a critical skill for ophthalmologists, especially as it remains the most widely performed type of corneal transplant in these parts of the world. Tools to teach and assess trainees in corneal transplantation are needed to help standardize training internationally. Here, we present an Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric (OSCAR) aimed at assessing the competence and progress of residents in PK.A team of cornea specialists developed a rubric for PK using previously published OSCARs as a template. The draft included 11 key steps of PK and six global indices, with a grading scale based on a modified Dreyfus model. The rubric was then reviewed for face and content validity by a panel of eight international experts using an iterative feedback process. The draft underwent multiple cycles of feedback and revisions until a consensus was reached among the authors and the international expert panel.The rubric contains 11 essential steps and six global indices with descriptions of expected functioning at four levels of competency (novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and competent).This OSCAR for PK contributes to the global standardization of ophthalmology training, helping to meet the increasing demand for corneal transplant services with high-quality care for all.Copyright © 2025 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin|Clara C Chan|Juan C Grandin|Adriana C Lotfi|Murugesan Vanathi|Karl C Golnik,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin,"Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Cornea Department, Zaldivar Institute, Mendoza, Argentina.|Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Services, Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.|Barrow Neurological Institute and the University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.","Mira Shoukry, Ashlie A Bernhisel, Angeline C Rivkin, Clara C Chan, Juan C Grandin, Adriana C Lotfi, Murugesan Vanathi, Karl C Golnik",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41460132/,"Corneal blindness is a major global health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access to skilled eye surgeons is limited.

Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to treat, with low survival rates, so finding more effective therapies is crucial. 

The PREOPANC-2 trial tested a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy given before surgery, for patients with pancreatic cancer that was either resectable (able to be surgically removed) or borderline resectable (close to vital structures, making surgery risky). The researchers wanted to see if this approach could improve outcomes compared to the standard treatment of surgery followed by chemotherapy. They enrolled over 300 patients and randomly assigned them to receive either the new pre-surgery treatment or the standard post-surgery treatment.

The results showed that the new pre-surgery approach did not significantly improve overall survival compared to the standard treatment. However, the researchers did find that patients who received the pre-surgery treatment had a lower risk of their cancer returning after the initial treatment. This suggests the new approach may still have benefits, even if it did not extend life expectancy overall.",,
41449148,2026-01-02,"Oncological outcomes with and without axillary lymph node dissection in patients with residual micrometastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OPBC-07/microNAC): an international, retrospective cohort study.","Despite the paucity of outcome data, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is increasingly being omitted in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in those with low-volume residual disease. We investigated oncological outcomes in patients with breast cancer and residual micrometastases in the sentinel lymph nodes treated with or without ALND.OPBC-07/microNAC was a retrospective cohort study, using data obtained from the institutional databases of 84 cancer centres in 30 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with clinical T1-4, N0-3 breast cancer at diagnosis treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2023, who were found to have residual micrometastases (metastasis measuring >0·2 mm or >200 cells, not exceeding 2·0 mm in size) on frozen section or on final paraffin sections as determined by sentinel lymph node biopsy, targeted axillary dissection (sentinel lymph node biopsy with single or dual-tracer mapping plus image-guided localisation of the initially biopsy-proven and clipped node), or the marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI) procedure were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint was the 5-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) stratified by type of axillary surgery. Given the median follow-up, here we report 3-year rates and exploratory 5-year estimates. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06529302.1585 female patients with ypN1mi disease were analysed, of whom 804 (50·7%) underwent ALND and 781 (49·3%) did not. Of 1585 women, 238 (15·0%) self-identified as Asian, 65 (4·1%) as Black, 200 (12·6%) as Hispanic, 968 (61·1%) as White, and 114 (7·2%) as unknown race and ethnicity. 925 (58·4%) of 1585 women had cT2 tumours, 1054 (66·5%) were node positive, and 1267 (79·9%) received nodal radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 3·1 years (IQR 1·8-5·2). The 3-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) for the entire cohort was 2·0% (95% CI 1·3-2·9), with no statistical difference identified by extent of axillary surgery. However, patients with triple-negative disease who did not receive ALND had significantly higher rates of any axillary recurrence than women treated with ALND (8·7% [95% CI 4·4-15·0] vs 2·4% [95% CI 0·7-6·5], p=0·018). On multivariable analysis, triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio 3·83 [95% CI 1·72-8·52]) and omission of nodal radiotherapy (2·62 [1·19-5·73]) but not omission of ALND (0·86 [0·37-2·00]) were independently associated with an increased risk of any axillary recurrence.Overall, these results do not support ALND for all patients with ypN1mi on sentinel lymph node biopsy treated with nodal radiotherapy; however, tumour biology should be taken into account when considering ALND omission.US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Traditionally, these patients would have their lymph nodes surgically removed (axillary lymph node dissection or ALND), but this procedure can cause side effects. The researchers wanted to see if ALND could be safely omitted in some patients. They analyzed data from over 1,500 patients treated at 84 cancer centers in 30 countries. They found that overall, patients who did not have ALND did not have higher rates of cancer recurrence in the lymph nodes compared to those who had the surgery. However, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (an aggressive subtype) who skipped ALND did have higher recurrence rates. The researchers concluded that ALND may not be necessary for all patients with residual micrometastases, especially if they receive radiation therapy to the lymph nodes. But for patients with triple-negative disease, ALND should still be considered to prevent lymph node recurrences.

We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed.Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide.Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.MSD.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Limited data exist on the inpatient outcomes of septic arthritis of the wrist among patients treated using arthroscopy versus open arthrotomy. The purpose of our study was to compare the reoperation rates and inpatient complications between these two procedures.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients 18 years old and older with a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the wrist in the United States from 2002 to 2012. Septic arthritis cases were classified based on the treatment modality, and patients who were treated either arthroscopically or using arthrotomy were included in statistical analysis. Hospitalization outcomes, including reoperation rates and surgical and medical complications were compared after adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Mean costs and length of stay were compared using the Student's t- test.A total of 1,065 patients with septic arthritis of the wrist were treated either arthroscopically (n = 516) or by open arthrotomy (n = 549). Patients who were treated arthroscopically had higher reoperation rates (48.6% vs 8.7%). Using multivariate analysis, patients who were treated arthroscopically were more likely to undergo repeat arthroscopic procedures (odds radio [OR], 10.4; 95% CI,7.0-15.3), although they were not different in terms of the risk of development of medical (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.80-1.80) or surgical (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.16) complications.

This study compared two common surgical approaches for treating septic arthritis in the wrist: arthroscopy (minimally invasive surgery using small cameras and tools) and open arthrotomy (open surgery to access the joint). 

The researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 patients in the United States who were treated for septic wrist arthritis between 2002-2012. They found that patients treated with arthroscopy had higher rates of needing repeat surgeries compared to those who had open arthrotomy. However, the two approaches did not differ in terms of other complications, hospital stay length, or costs. 

These findings suggest that while arthroscopy may be a less invasive option, orthopedic surgeons should be aware that it carries a higher risk of requiring additional procedures to fully treat the infection. Patients should discuss this potential complication with their surgeon when deciding on the best treatment approach. Limitations include that the study only looked at inpatient data, so long-term outcomes were not evaluated. Further research is needed to fully understand the",,

IUD insertion is a common procedure, but complications like this patient's symptoms can sometimes occur. The researchers closely examined this patient's case to try to determine the underlying cause of the complications. 

Through detailed medical tests and evaluation, the researchers found that the patient had developed an infection in the uterus, which was triggering the painful cramping and excessive bleeding. This type of infection, known as endometritis, can sometimes happen after IUD insertion if bacteria enter the uterus during the procedure. The researchers were able to successfully treat the infection with antibiotics, resolving the patient's symptoms. 

This case study highlights the importance of closely monitoring patients after IUD insertion and quickly addressing any complications that arise. While IUDs are generally safe and effective, rare issues like this can occur. By understanding the potential causes, healthcare providers can better prepare for and manage these situations, ensuring patients receive prompt, appropriate treatment.

The most common neuro-ophthalmologic manifestation of NMOSD is atypical optic neuritis (ON), characterized by severe vision loss with a higher propensity toward bilateral involvement, longitudinal enhancement of the optic nerve, and chiasmal involvement than MS-related optic neuritis. Due to the severity of disease, high recurrence rate, and significant risk of permanent deficits, early recognition of neuro-ophthalmologic signs and short- and long-term management with immunosuppressive therapies is critical.

In Rwanda, governmental and nonprofit efforts have made significant progress in expanding access to health care in the wake of the 1994 genocide; however, specialized care remains largely unrecognized or inaccessible. In response, the Rwanda Ministry of Health established a partnership with an international gastroenterology NGO to address this critical need.We present summative data generated by this partnership. To inform future global GI programs, we provide lessons learned and details about Rwanda's successful establishment of an in-country, self-sustainable, and locally governed gastroenterology training program.From 2017 to 2023, the partnership expanded the number of clinical sites receiving care from 4 to 11. Total procedural volume increased from 244 to 1069. Most common presenting upper GI symptoms included dyspepsia, reflux, and emesis, while most common lower GI symptoms included hematochezia and constipation. Since 2017, this partnership has increased the number of faculty volunteering in Rwanda (and Rwandan clinicians studying in US academic medical centers), expanded its geographical reach, assisted in the creation of a GI fellowship, and enabled Rwanda to become an East African hub for medical education.Lessons learned across ethical, financial, leadership, cultural, and medical domains from the successful establishment and expansion of an international GI partnership in Rwanda provides invaluable insights to guide development of future models of health care in emerging economies.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This review presents the profile of estetrol in support of the rationale of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, E4COMFORT I and E4COMFORT II, as well as the design of those. E4COMFORT I and II are aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of estetrol in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. The E4COMFORT I and II trials were divided into an efficacy part (arms 1-3) and a safety part (arm 4). Efficacy was evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining two doses of estetrol (15 mg and 20 mg) in postmenopausal participants, both hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized, who experienced 7 or more moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day (or 50 or more per week). To comply with Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines for long-term safety assessments in both groups, these trials evaluated the overall and endometrial safety of unopposed estetrol and of estetrol combined with natural progesterone. The total enrolment across the E4COMFORT I and II trials was 2576 participants. The results of these trials are expected to give a thorough understanding of estetrol 's potential as a new, distinctive treatment option for women with postmenopausal symptoms.

Pelvic exenteration involves removing the rectum, bladder, and sometimes other organs to try to completely remove the tumor. In the past, this surgery was considered too risky if the tumor had spread to involve major blood vessels or bones in the pelvis. 

The researchers looked at data from 763 patients who underwent pelvic exenteration at 16 specialized cancer centers around the world. They compared outcomes between ""conventional"" pelvic exenteration and more ""high-complexity"" procedures where the tumor had spread to involve critical structures.

Accurate monitoring of physical activity is essential to understand its impact on health outcomes in older adults. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hip-worn and ankle-worn accelerometers in capturing physical activities in older adults, comparing their performance to self-reported activity across weekdays and weekends.Forty healthy participants aged 51-82 years completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on both their right hip and ankle for four consecutive days, covering two weekdays and two weekends. Data from the accelerometers were analyzed to compare step counts and the ability to detect sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activities between the two sensor placements.The ankle-worn accelerometer recorded higher step counts and more light physical activities. In contrast, the hip-worn accelerometer detected more moderate to vigorous physical activities. Self-reported physical activity was well correlated with step counts and sedentary/light activities on weekdays, but failed to reflect moderate to vigorous activity and all activities on weekends.Ankle-worn accelerometers are more effective in estimating light activities, which dominate the daily activity patterns of older adults. Hip-worn accelerometers better capture intensive activities. Self-reports demonstrated limited reliability in assessing physical activity on weekends.

41176274,2026-01-02,A Targeted LC-MS/MS-Based Quantitative Assay for Detecting Plasma Factor XIII A/B Subunit Deficiency.,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a heterotetramer that plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade, facilitating fibrin crosslinking to stabilize clots. Congenital or acquired deficiency of the FXIII A or B subunits can lead to prolonged bleeding. Existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based and latex agglutination assays for measuring FXIII are limited to detecting only the FXIIIA subunit of the complex. In this study, a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed and validated to accurately quantify both FXIIIA and FXIIIB subunits in plasma. Peptides measured by this targeted assay were rigorously selected based on analytical robustness, with the method demonstrating excellent sensitivity (limit of detection, 1.56 to 3.67 mU/mL), linearity (r2 > 0.998), and precision (CV, <10%). Comparison with the conventional assay based on ammonia release demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.983) and agreement (Cohen κ = 0.846) for FXIIIA. On analysis of 98 clinical plasma samples, the assay accurately identified cases with FXIII deficiency based on significantly reduced FXIIIA with varying alterations in FXIIIB levels.

41167303,2026-01-02,"Clinical Validation of Duoseq, a Novel Assay for Clinical DNA and RNA Sequencing.","Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become integral to the clinical workup of blood cancers. However, there remain barriers to implementing clinical NGS, including the separate workflows required for DNA and RNA sequencing, complex bioinformatics analyses, and long turnaround times. Duoseq has been developed as a comprehensive, kitted solution to these barriers and implemented as a genomic profiling tool for blood cancers to simultaneously detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs; translocations and fusions). Additionally, Duoseq can evaluate numerous other blood cancer diagnostic markers, including gene expression, copy number alterations, cell of origin, oncogenic viral status (eg, Epstein-Barr virus), B-/T-cell receptor clonality, Ig heavy chain mutational status, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Analytical and clinical validation of Duoseq was performed in parallel at two clinical institutions. Limit of detection was confirmed as 5% variant allele frequency for SNVs, 10% variant allele frequency for indels, and ≥20% tumor purity for SVs. Repeatability studies showed >99% intrarun and interrun positive predictive value and >96% percentage positive agreement. Duoseq was run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens (N = 197), using NGS and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization as orthogonal comparison. SNVs, indels, and SVs achieved accuracy of >95%. These results establish Duoseq as a genomic profiling tool for blood cancers that can enable laboratories to provide critical diagnostic information in a time- and cost-effective manner.Copyright © 2026 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Current genetic testing for blood cancers often requires separate tests for DNA and RNA, which can be complex and time-consuming. Duoseq is designed to overcome these challenges by providing a comprehensive analysis of both DNA and RNA in a single test.

The researchers thoroughly tested Duoseq's accuracy and reliability by running it on over 190 patient samples and comparing the results to other established genetic tests. They found that Duoseq could accurately detect a wide range of genetic changes associated with blood cancers, including mutations, rearrangements, and changes in gene expression. Importantly, Duoseq was able to achieve these results using small tissue samples, such as those obtained from biopsies.

This new test has the potential to significantly improve the clinical care of blood cancer patients. By providing a streamlined, comprehensive genetic analysis, Duoseq could help doctors make faster and more informed treatment decisions. Additionally, the test's ability to monitor genetic changes over time could help track disease progression and guide ongoing management.

The researchers analyzed reports of side effects and complications associated with each drug, to determine which one may be safer for patients with Castleman disease. They reviewed data from a large national database that tracks medication safety. The results showed that tocilizumab had a higher rate of serious side effects compared to siltuximab, including infections, gastrointestinal problems, and changes in blood cell counts. This suggests siltuximab may be the safer option for managing Castleman disease, with a lower risk of potentially harmful reactions.

The study focused on the 3 currently US Food and Drug Administration-cleared AI systems: LumineticsCore, EyeArt, and AEYE Diagnostic Screening (AEYE-DS), assessing their performance and strategies utilized by health systems to effectively implement this technology in clinics.Diagnostic accuracy data, ophthalmologist feedback.The literature review found 6 publications reporting diagnostic accuracy data of autonomous AI DR testing in primary care office settings, including 5 for LumineticsCore and 1 for EyeArt. Additional articles, of which 18 were selected for detailed review, addressed impact on patient adherence, health equity, and carbon footprint, as well as cost-effectiveness and workflow efficiency analyses. There were no studies comparing the systems on the same patients. In aggregate, adopters of the AI systems reported average nonmydriatic gradability of 49% to 75% (n = 5), sensitivity 87% to 100% (n = 3), and specificity 60% to 91% (n = 4). Based on public records at the time of writing, both LumineticsCore and EyeArt have >5 academic adopters in the United States. Limited information is available on AEYE-DS given recency of regulatory clearance. Elements of successful implementation include proper site selection, aligning AI tools with primary care clinic workflows, streamlining patient engagement and referrals, and ongoing training of staff. Health systems utilizing AI reported improved Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures, health equity, productivity, and patient adherence to follow-up with ophthalmology.Artificial intelligence-aided diabetic eye examinations present a promising solution to facilitate early detection of DR, promote equitable access, and drive down system-level cost of care.

This meta-analysis compared high ligation (HL) versus low ligation (LL) of IMA in terms of postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).A systematic search of 5 databases (inception-May 2025) identified 15 RCTs comparing LL and HL in rectal or sigmoid cancer. Primary outcomes included 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall complications, and anastomotic leak (AL) rates. Secondary outcomes included lymph node yield, operative time, and blood loss. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were performed.A total of 2576 patients were included. LL significantly improved 5-year OS (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 0.026) and reduced AL rates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51-1.00; p = 0.050), without compromising DFS or lymph node yield. TSA confirmed the OS benefit and robustness of AL reduction, with the cumulative Z-curve crossing both the conventional and trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit. LL was not associated with increased overall complications, operative time, or blood loss. GRADE ratings indicated moderate-to-high certainty for key outcomes.Low ligation of the IMA offers a survival advantage and reduced anastomotic leak risk without compromising oncologic safety.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cytokine dysregulation and microglial dysfunction in adolescents with MDD (regardless of disease onset or duration) during the course of the disorder.This study included 60 adolescent patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls (HCs). Peripheral blood levels of nine target cytokines-including interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-were measured using ultrasensitive multiplex electrochemiluminescence assays. To better understand the potential changes in microglial cells of adolescents with MDD, the human microglial cell line HMC3 was treated with 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), a key neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway (KP), and the effects of 3-HK on microglial cells were subsequently evaluated.After multiple test correction using the Holm method, compared with the HCs, adolescents with MDD exhibited a significant increase in the level of the peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α. Moreover, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-18 showed an upward trend, while the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ showed a downward trend, yet none of these trends reached statistical significance. In addition, G-CSF levels were significantly decreased, while M-CSF levels were significantly increased. In vitro experiments, 3-HK significantly reduced the viability of human microglial cells. Further experiments demonstrated that 3-HK induced microglial pyroptosis in a concentration-dependent manner via the mitochondrial pathway, leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.Dysregulation of cytokines may lead to excessive activation of microglia, resulting in increased release of the neurotoxic KP metabolite 3-HK. This suppresses microglial proliferation and induces microglial cell death, including pyroptosis, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41134013,2026-01-02,Parameters Associated With Renal Recovery and Survival in Myeloma Patients With Acute Renal Failure to Cast Nephropathy.,"Acute renal failure due to cast nephropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we aimed to identify parameters associated with renal outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM patients with CAN-related acute renal failure and to validate the IMWG criteria for renal response. CAN diagnosis was based on biopsy or clinical assessment. Of 787 registered patients, 354 met the inclusion criteria, requiring at least two therapy cycles with documented chemotherapy response, renal response, and eGFR. Baseline free light chain (FLC) levels (median 6825.65 mg/L) decreased below 500 mg/L in 67.8% of patients. According to IMWG classification, renal complete response, partial response, and minimal response were achieved in 33.9%, 19.5%, and 28.0% of patients, respectively. The best eGFR values > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 33.9% of patients, while 33.3%, 22.3%, and 10.5% had best eGFR values of 30-59, 15-29, and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Renal response correlated with baseline FLC levels, IgG kappa, eGFR, and ECOG status in multivariate analysis, as well as with myeloma response and FLC reduction in univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 77.6 months. Survival correlated with age, myeloma response, ECOG status, FLC kappa type, baseline eGFR, standard-risk cytogenetics, and calcium levels, among other factors. A comparison of IMWG renal response criteria with classification based solely on best eGFR showed similar utility. Of 136 patients requiring dialysis, 80 (58.8%) were able to discontinue dialysis during therapy.

Interrater reliability for accuracy ratings was higher for LLM-generated responses (GPT-4 [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.30], Gemini [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.61], and MedLM [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.58]), with lower agreement for expert responses (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.23). A similar pattern was observed for safety and source discrimination ratings. The agreement was strongest for safety assessments and weakest for source discrimination.Among the 3 tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrated closer agreement to expert decisions, thereby showing greater potential for supporting hypertension management.

This study explored whether large language models (LLMs) - advanced artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human-like text - could help improve the management of hypertension. The researchers created 51 hypothetical patient scenarios and had three different LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, and MedLM) as well as a human hypertension expert provide treatment recommendations. Blinded reviewers then evaluated the accuracy and safety of the recommendations. The results showed that the most advanced LLM, GPT-4, performed the best among the AI systems, with 83% accuracy and 86% safety in its recommendations. However, it still fell short of the expert, who achieved 92% accuracy and 93% safety. The other LLMs performed significantly worse.

We evaluated whether biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion-specifically, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch volume-were associated with recurrent ischemic stroke within 90 days.The BIORISK ICAS (Biomarkers and Recurrence Risk in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis) is a multicenter retrospective international study (35 sites) that included hospitalized patients with symptomatic ICAS (50%-99% luminal stenosis of the intracranial vertebral, basilar, distal internal carotid, or proximal middle cerebral artery) from January 2019 to June 2024. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery within 90 days. In the primary analysis, the exposure was an acute anterior circulation borderzone infarct. In secondary analysis of the subset with presentation within 72 hours of last known normal and perfusion imaging completed, the exposure of interest was prespecified as hypoperfusion mismatch volume at Tmax (time to maximum) threshold of 6 seconds, dichotomized at the Youden index. We performed multivariable Cox regression to test associations between exposure variables and the outcome, adjusting for clinically relevant variables and those associated with the outcome (P<0.1).Of 2050 patients with symptomatic ICAS, 1737 (84.7%) presented within 72 hours of symptom onset, among whom 509 (29.3%) underwent perfusion imaging. The primary analysis included 1891 patients; 174 (9.2%) patients had recurrent ischemic stroke in the symptomatic arterial territory. In adjusted Cox regression models, there was an association between anterior circulation borderzone infarct and recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.02-1.93]). In the perfusion imaging analysis, hypoperfusion mismatch of ≥10 mL was associated with recurrent ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.03-3.28]).Biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch were associated with increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. These findings support the use of perfusion imaging in ICAS as well as future trials investigating early reperfusion in high-risk patients with ICAS.",Stroke,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Shadi Yaghi|Farhan Khan|Skylar Lewis|Ava Stipanovich|Richard Choi|Richard Baker|Sami Al Kasab|Ahmad Abu Qdais|Sridhara S Yaddanapudi|Sabiha Sultana|Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik|James Klaas|Ekaterina Bakradze|Muhammad Aemaz Ur Rehman|Christopher Leon Guerrero|Hadley W Ressler|Faddi G Saleh Velez|Cameron Owens|Camila B Pinto|Margy McCullough-Hicks|Dawson Cooper|Abhiram Parameswaran Pillai|Praveen Hariharan|Shaista Alam|Morgan Mayer|Mirjam R Heldner|Irina Kugler|Kateryna Antonenko|William Almiri|Sheila Martins|Thais L Secchi|Gabriel Mantovani|Aaron Rothstein|Kelly Sloane|Balaji Krishnaiah|Linda Alfred|Cheran Elangovan|Venugopalan Y Vishnu|Meena Chandu|Ayush Agarwal|Michele Romoli|Nicola Marrone|Stefano Vozzi|Malik Ghannam|Mohamed Elshikh|Mahmoud Dibas|Yan Hou|Krithika Peshwe|Ajay Tunguturi|João P Marto|Rui Duarte Armindo|Jennifer Frontera|Lindsey Kuohn|Mohammad AlMajali|Osama O Zaidat|Benan Barakat|Niha Khan|Alexis N Simpkins|Shayak Sen|Mariana Coelho|Joao Sargento Fritas|Joao A Sousa|Diana Aguiar de Sousa|Mafalda Soares|Amanda Cyntia Lima Fonseca Rodrigues|Aditya Jhaveri|Rami Z Morsi|James Siegler|Yasmin N Aziz|Pablo Harker|Sonia Bhati|Sophia Vassilopoulou|Argyro Tountopoulou|Adam de Havenon|Varsha Muddasani|Nils Henninger|Hieu Tran|Johanna Helenius|Mohammad Khasawneh|Ananth Vellimana|Ryan Apfel|Amir Molaie|Marina Mannino|Valeria Terruso|Tarek El Halabi|Mahasen Reda|Christel Tamer|Piers Klein|Liqi Shu|Pooja Khatri|Karen Furie|Thanh N Nguyen|David S Liebeskind|Shyam Prabhakaran,Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik,"Department of Neurology, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI (S.Y., F.K., S.L., A.S., L.S., K.F.).|Department of Neurology, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ (S.Y.).|Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA (S.A., M.

ICAS can increase the risk of having another stroke soon after an initial one. The researchers looked at whether certain brain imaging markers could help predict which ICAS patients are at highest risk of having another stroke within 90 days. 

They analyzed data from over 2,000 ICAS patients across 35 medical centers. The key findings were that two specific imaging markers were linked to a higher risk of recurrent stroke: 1) a type of brain injury called an ""anterior circulation borderzone infarct"", and 2) a mismatch between blood flow and oxygen demand in the brain, known as ""hypoperfusion mismatch"". Patients with these imaging markers were 40-80% more likely to have another stroke within 3 months.

These results suggest that advanced brain imaging could help identify ICAS patients who need urgent treatment to prevent another devastating stroke. This information could guide clinical decision-making and lead to new therapies targeted at restoring blood flow in high-risk ICAS patients",,

The researchers reviewed detailed case files on a large number of suicide deaths across the UK to better understand the relationship between self-harm and completed suicide in this vulnerable population. 

They found that a significant majority of the young people who died by suicide had a history of self-harm, often starting at a very young age. The researchers also identified common factors that contributed to suicide risk, such as mental health issues, trauma, and social/family difficulties. This suggests that early intervention and support for young people who self-harm could be crucial for preventing future suicide deaths. 

However, the study also highlighted gaps in data collection and the need for more comprehensive suicide prevention programs tailored to the unique needs of children and adolescents.

The researchers analyzed data from a large group of patients who had received MG testing as part of their anemia evaluation. They found that about 12% of these patients were diagnosed with a new MG condition through the testing. However, only a very small percentage (0.4%) of the MG test results actually provided clinically significant information that helped identify the underlying cause of the patient's anemia. This suggests that routine MG testing may not be necessary or helpful for most patients with anemia, unless there are other specific symptoms or risk factors present. 

These findings could help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about when MG testing is truly warranted, potentially reducing unnecessary medical procedures and costs. However, the study was limited to a single healthcare system, so more research is needed to confirm these results in other patient",,

Lutetium (Lu)-177 DOTATATE therapy has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with metastatic NET; however, there are limited data regarding the direct impact on cardiac metastases. Patients with intracardiac metastasis from NET were evaluated. Patients were stratified by treatment with Lu-177 DOTATATE. Quantitative assessments of the progression of cardiac metastatic size (maximal diameter) and metabolic activity, as measured by maximal standardized uptake value (SUV max ), were performed on serial 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET imaging. In a cohort of 23 patients, 11 patients (47.8%) received Lu-177 DOTATATE therapy. Through a median of 2.2 years of follow-up, these patients showed some reduction in metastatic burden with a median reduction in maximal diameter of 1.0 mm (IQR: 0.0-3.0) and a median change in SUV max of -1.6 (IQR: -4.4 to 1.5). In contrast, patients who did not receive Lu-177 DOTATATE had some increase in maximal diameter of 0.5 mm (-2.0 to 2.0) and an increase in SUV max of 1.4 (-6.2 to 2.3). Overall, Lu-177 DOTATATE therapy may result in modest regression of intracardiac metastases as assessed by molecular imaging, whereas patients with cardiac metastases who did not receive therapy appeared to show progression.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

We report a case of a 9-year-old male who presented with a progressively enlarging swelling of the left orbit associated with vision loss with atypical imaging features and an intracranial component with compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma. Histopathological examination subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of GCT. He was managed with a multimodal approach comprising neoadjuvant therapy and surgical excision, which achieved complete tumor removal, with no evidence of recurrence at 1-year follow-up.

It is also a type of functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), which are disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). The underlying mechanism is thought to involve a complex interaction between the gut and central nervous system (CNS), where altered gut signaling may lead to visceral hypersensitivity, while CNS dysregulation may cause hyper-vigilance, potentially contributing to motor disturbances. There is no standardized approach to the evaluation of FD and historically, it has been considered a diagnosis of exclusion. There is also no standardized treatment algorithm, and most FD treatments are garnered from other FGIDs. As our field gains a deeper appreciation of FGIDs, it is also clear that the management of suspected FD patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. This narrative review not only 1) provides an overview of FD including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, associated disorders, multidisciplinary assessment, and treatment, but also 2) details our unique multidisciplinary approach to FD patients from the perspective of gastroenterologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and GI psychologists at the Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders at the University of South Florida (USF CSD).",Gastro hep advances,2026,2026.0,,,Jaimie Anderson|Wojciech Blonski|Joy Gaziano|Camille Thélin|Rebecca Klam|Samuel Slone|Rene L Utianski|John Jacobs,Rene L Utianski,"Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, Speech Language Pathology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Division of Gastroenterology, James A Haley Veterans Affairs, Hospital, Tampa, Florida.|Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Neurogastroenterology and Motility Center, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Jaimie Anderson, Wojciech Blonski, Joy Gaziano, Camille Thélin, Rebecca Klam, Samuel Slone, Rene L Utianski, John Jacobs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127144/,"Functional dysphagia is a condition where people have difficulty swallowing solid or liquid foods, but there is no clear physical cause like a blockage or muscle problem.

Metastatic breast cancer, where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, is a serious and often life-threatening condition. Accurately predicting how long patients with metastatic breast cancer may live is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and setting appropriate expectations. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer to test a novel ""prognostic staging system"" - a way of classifying patients into different risk groups based on factors like the extent of metastatic spread. They found that this new system was able to accurately predict overall survival as well as cancer-specific outcomes, meaning it could reliably identify patients with better or worse prognoses. This validation of the system's performance is an important step towards implementing it in clinical practice.

If further validated, this prognostic staging system could help doctors have more informed discussions with metastatic breast cancer patients about their likely disease course and treatment options. It may also enable more personalized and effective care by allowing doctors to tailor treatments based on a patient's predicted outcomes",,
41117176,2026-01-02,What Is Clinical Anatomy?-A Consensus Statement From the American Association of Clinical Anatomists.,"At the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA) in Bellevue, Washington, June 2025, two inaugural events-the Clinical Anatomy Fireside Chat (CAFC) and the Clinical Anatomy Symposium: Head and Neck 2025 (CAS)-fostered rich dialogue on the evolving role and operational definition of clinical anatomy. Experts from various clinical and anatomical disciplines explored the meaning of clinical anatomy, highlighting the absence of a universal definition despite its frequent use in education and research. Through these interdisciplinary discussions, a consensus emerged: clinical anatomy is not defined solely by the possession of clinical credentials but by the integration of anatomical knowledge and clinical relevance, achieved most effectively through collaboration. Clinical anatomy education and research require different depths of clinical knowledge depending on the audience and objective, and meaningful collaboration can bridge gaps in expertise. The symposium further illustrated that high-quality clinical anatomy emerges from mutual respect and reciprocal insight between clinicians and anatomists. This article presents a consensus statement developed by AACA representatives and invited speakers, affirming that collaboration is not only foundational to the practice of clinical anatomy but also fundamental to its definition. These conclusions aim to guide future educational models, research strategies, and interdisciplinary partnerships in the field of clinical anatomy.© 2025 The Author(s).

41177002,2026-01-02,Menstrual irregularities and cardiometabolic risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Menstrual cycle irregularities have been linked to several health hazards; it is unclear how these risks relate to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compile data regarding the relationship between irregular menstruation and women's cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes.A systematic search of online databases was conducted for studies comparing cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes between women with irregular and regular menstrual cycles. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated adopting a random effects model.Eight observational studies comprising 354,419 women were included. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a significantly increased risk of overall cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.01 to 2.03) compared to those with regular menstrual cycles. Subgroup analyses for specific cardiovascular outcomes demonstrated increased risks of coronary artery disease (RR: 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.14-1.46), hypertension (RR: 1.50, 95 % CI: 1.23-1.82) and heart failure (RR: 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.89) in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles. Additionally, the risk of cerebrovascular disease was higher in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles (RR: 1.62, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.40), Notably, patients with irregular menstrual cycles were found to have a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus (RR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.31-2.34) and hypercholesterolemia (RR: 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.52).Menstrual irregularities are associated with greater risks for several cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, highlighting the importance of regular check-ups to prevent disease occurrence in these patients.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers analyzed the medical records and genetic data of these 91 patients to see how the low mutation levels correlated with their clinical symptoms and disease progression over time. They found that even very low levels of the JAK2 V617F mutation can be associated with blood disorders like myeloproliferative neoplasms, which cause the overproduction of blood cells. However, the specific symptoms and disease course varied widely among patients, suggesting these low mutation levels don't always indicate a clear diagnosis. The study also revealed that the mutation levels can change over time, sometimes increasing or decreasing, which further complicates interpretation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve diagnostic performance, but robust benchmarks and reliable comparison to radiologists' performance are scarce. We established an open-source benchmark with the aim of investigating AI systems for PDAC detection on CT and compared them to radiologists' performance, at scale.In this international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory, observational study (PANORAMA), the AI system was trained and externally validated within an international benchmark, with a cohort of 2310 patients from four tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the USA for training (n=2224) and tuning (n=86), and a sequestered cohort of 1130 patients from five tertiary care centres (the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway) for testing. A multi-reader, multi-case observer study with 68 radiologists (40 centres, 12 countries; median 9·0 [IQR 6·0-14·5] years of experience) was conducted on a subset of 391 patients from the testing cohort. The reference standard was established with histopathology and at least 3 years of clinical follow-up. The primary endpoint was the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system compared to that of radiologists at PDAC detection on CT. The study protocol and statistical plan were prespecified to test non-inferiority (considering a margin of 0·05), followed by superiority towards the AI system. This study is registered with Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10599559) and is complete.Of the 3440 (1511 [44%] female, 1929 [56%] male; median age 67 [IQR 58-74] years) included patients (Jan 1, 2004 to Dec 31, 2023), 1103 (32%) received a positive PDAC diagnosis. In the sequestered testing cohort of 1130 patients (406 with histologically confirmed PDAC), AI achieved an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·90-0·93). In the subset of 391 patients (144 [37%] with histologically confirmed PDAC) used for the reader study, AI achieved statistically non-inferior (p<0·0001) and superior (p=0·001) performance with an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·89-0·94), compared to the pool of 68 participating radiologists, with an AUROC of 0·88 (0·85-0·91).AI demonstrated substantially improved PDAC detection on routine CT scans compared to radiologists on average, showing potential to detect cancer earlier and improve patient outcomes.European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41236415,2026-01-02,Advances in echocardiography for cardiac amyloidosis and restrictive cardiomyopathies.,"Cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with characteristic echocardiographic findings. Echocardiography is the initial imaging test to identify restrictive cardiomyopathies, and timely diagnosis is important for treatment and prognosis. This review outlines key echocardiographic ""red flags,"" structural and functional findings, and emerging diagnostic tools that enhance early recognition and monitoring of cardiac amyloidosis.Classic echocardiographic red flags for cardiac amyloidosis include increased ventricular wall thickness, biatrial enlargement, pericardial effusion, and a granular myocardial appearance. Tissue Doppler imaging shows reduced mitral annular velocities, while advanced disease presents with restrictive filling patterns. Global longitudinal strain with apical sparing is a hallmark finding that distinguishes cardiac amyloidosis from other cardiomyopathies. Left atrial strain has been proposed as a prognostic marker for thromboembolism in cardiac amyloidosis. Evidence shows variability in strain measurements across different vendors, which is an important consideration when comparing results between institutions in both research and clinical practice. Echocardiography can be used in conjunction with multimodal imaging techniques in order to monitor disease progression.Echocardiography is the initial diagnostic test of choice and several findings can suggest cardiac amyloidosis.

Care coordination (CC) may strengthen SBIRT by supporting brief interventions, improving referral follow-through, and enhancing continuity. CC models and outcomes vary, however, and no prior scoping review has synthesized these.A comprehensive search of 10 resources, including Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, was conducted on 4/15/2025. Eligible studies described outpatient SBIRT models adding CC for any age group. Articles were excluded if they lacked CC, presented no original data, or were not in English. Relevant implementation and patient-level outcomes were extracted to describe CC models and their impact.Of 737 abstracts and 50 full texts reviewed, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Studies spanned primary care, specialty care, and age ranges. CC models included embedded behavioral health providers, centralized linkage managers, and remote coordinators using phone or digital platforms. CC was associated with higher screening completion, brief intervention delivery, referral initiation, and treatment engagement. Successful integration incorporated structured communication, follow-up protocols, and accessible technology. Barriers included limited billing infrastructure, weak electronic record integration, and unclear roles.CC appears to enhance SBIRT implementation and treatment engagement across outpatient settings. Embedded approaches offer relational benefits, while remote and digital strategies show promise for scalability.

A distinct intermuscular fascial border aids in delineating the separation between the brachioradialis (BR) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) muscles. However, this border may be absent, making correct needle placement complex and assessment more difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe the presence and absence of this fascial border in healthy individuals to help with accurate EMG needle placement.Twenty healthy patients underwent sonographic examination by a single sonographer physician of the ECRL and BR to identify the presence or absence of the intermuscular fascial border.The fascial border that routinely separates the ECRL and BR was absent in at least one arm in 20% of subjects (12.5% of upper limbs). One subject had an absent fascial border in both upper limbs.US can assess for the presence or absence of intermuscular fascial borders.

When a patient receives an artificial hip or knee, the body can sometimes react by breaking down the surrounding bone, a condition known as periprosthetic osteolysis. This can lead to the implant becoming loose and failing, requiring additional surgery. 

The researchers investigated how FSTL1 influences this bone-destroying process. They found that FSTL1 promotes the development of osteoclasts, specialized cells that break down bone. FSTL1 activates a cellular signaling pathway called JNK, which drives osteoclast formation and accelerates periprosthetic osteolysis around the implant. 

These findings suggest that targeting FSTL1 or the JNK pathway could be a promising approach to prevent or slow down this complication in joint replacement patients. This could help improve the long-term success of these common surgeries and reduce the need for revision operations. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and develop effective therapies based on this discovery.",,
41263784,2026-01-02,Relationship between aerobic fitness and adipose tissue insulin resistance.,"Aerobic fitness is associated with greater skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity with regard to glucose uptake. Whether fitness is associated with an improvement in the insulin regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis is unknown. We collated adipose insulin sensitivity, body composition, and fitness data from six of our previously published and two of our unpublished protocols. Adipose tissue insulin resistance index of palmitate (ADIPO-IRpalmitate) data were available for 340 volunteers, and the insulin concentration resulting in a 50% suppression of palmitate rate of appearance (FFApalmitate IC50) measured using the insulin clamp technique was available for 108 volunteers. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the independent variables of aerobic fitness [peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak), mL kg·FFM-1·min-1], age, sex, body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), body fat, percent body fat, and the dependent variables ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Factors that were univariately correlated (P < 0.001) with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 were BMI, percent body fat, body fat, and VAT. Fitness correlated negatively with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Stepwise regression analysis showed that fitness independently predicted ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 after adjusting for the other significant factors. These findings suggest that aerobic fitness may promote metabolic health through positive effects on adipose tissue. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00254371; the other protocols were not considered clinical trials at the time they were conducted.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Greater degrees of aerobic fitness are associated with greater insulin-mediated muscle glucose uptake. Insulin regulates adipose tissue lipolysis, whether aerobic fitness affects insulin's ability to regulate lipolysis is unknown. We found that greater fitness is associated with improved adipose tissue insulin responsiveness independent of age, sex, BMI, visceral adipose tissue, body fat (kg), percent body fat, and adipocyte size.

Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and fat metabolism. When someone is less responsive to insulin, it can lead to conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity. 

The researchers looked at data from over 300 volunteers, measuring their aerobic fitness (how efficiently their body uses oxygen during exercise), body composition, and how sensitive their fat tissue was to insulin. They found that people with higher aerobic fitness tended to have fat tissue that was more responsive to insulin, even after accounting for factors like age, sex, and body mass index. This suggests that improving aerobic fitness through exercise may have benefits beyond just muscle function - it could also help the body better regulate fat metabolism and storage. 

These findings are important because they indicate that exercise and improved fitness may have wide-ranging metabolic benefits, not just for muscles but also for fat tissue. This could have implications for managing conditions like diabetes and obesity.

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of severe pain during the 1-week period after RCT among consecutive patients requiring RCT and to identify pre-operative and intra-operative predictors of post-RCT severe pain in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network.This prospective cohort study enrolled patients across 153 general and endodontic practices. Eligible adults undergoing RCT completed surveys before and 1 week after treatment. Severe post-RCT pain was defined as patient-reported worst pain ≥7 on a 0-10 scale in the prior 7 days. Demographic, clinical, procedural, and psychosocial characteristics were collected and analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, accounting for clustering by practice.Among 1,059 patients, mean worst pain scores declined significantly from 5.3 pre-RCT to 2.6 post-RCT (p<.001). However, 14% reported severe pain at 1 week. Female sex, severe pain at time of RCT, screening positive for temporomandibular disorders, diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and having taken pain medication for tooth pain in the 7 days prior to RCT, were each significantly associated with severe post-RCT pain. Neither age, tooth type, provider specialty status, or psychosocial characteristics were independently predictive. Presence of a draining sinus tract and use of over 5x magnification were protective.One in seven patients reported severe pain in the first week after RCT, primarily associated with pre-operative pain factors and patient sex, underscoring the value of targeted pain management for high-risk patients.Despite overall pain reduction after RCT, 14% of patients experience severe pain at one week.

These diseases are associated with bowel disturbances, which should be evaluated preferably with questionnaires, and with anal weakness and/or DD, often evident on a thorough digital rectal examination. Fissures and DD are closely linked to constipation, whereas FI is typically associated with diarrhea. For most patients with mild symptoms, lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and/or pharmacotherapy suffice. Some patients require tests to rule out serious diseases; assess anorectal functions, which are discussed in detail; and to identify structural abnormalities, such as rectoceles, which are occasionally clinically significant. Treatments are applied stepwise, starting with conservative therapy with simpler treatments when feasible (eg, rubber band ligation for grade I-II hemorrhoids), with surgery, usually excisional hemorrhoidectomy, being reserved for more severe disease; for anal fissures, topical therapy using a calcium channel antagonist or nitroglycerine, followed by botulinum toxin and, less frequently, lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic fissures. Anorectal biofeedback therapy is effective for managing DD and, together with bowel modifiers tailored to the specific symptoms (ie, constipation and/or diarrhea), is also used for FI. Biofeedback therapy is not widely accessible, and many patients are treated by pelvic floor physical therapists. For FI, minimally invasive options include sacral neuromodulation and anal dextranomer injection, with colostomy or anal sphincteroplasty now rarely required.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have drawn attention for their impact on obesity. With a dense population of receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract, it is critical to understand the way that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists impact gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.To evaluate the expanding role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity and gastrointestinal disease, with a focus on therapeutic applications, impact on gastrointestinal cancers, safety profile, and implications for gastroenterology practice.We conducted a narrative review of recent clinical trials, cohort studies, and guideline updates through 2025. Evidence was synthesised on efficacy, safety, and clinical implications across gastrointestinal disorders including steatotic liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, and obesity-associated cancers.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists induce substantial and durable weight loss and improve obesity-related gastrointestinal outcomes. They are approved for steatotic liver disease, with demonstrated histologic and biochemical benefits. Evidence suggests a reduced incidence of several gastrointestinal cancers. The most common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and delayed gastric emptying, which may affect peri-endoscopic management. Discontinuation rates remain substantial but can be mitigated by careful titration and specialist oversight.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a critical therapy for obesity and several related gastrointestinal conditions.

Recent structural biology advances have significantly improved our understanding of GPCRs activation mechanisms and their interactions with G-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways, where they regulate neurotransmission at synapses and maintain neuronal homeostasis by activating heterotrimeric G-protein (Gαβγ). Evidence from preclinical studies suggests that GPCRs enhance neuronal excitability, especially in epilepsy, a condition impacting about 1-2% of the global population. Currently approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) mainly target ion channels but fail to address key pathological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, synaptic remodelling, and imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission. These unresolved mechanisms, combined with the side effects of AEDs, present a significant therapeutic gap in seizure treatment and drug-resistant seizures. This gap in therapy highlights the need for ongoing research into novel molecular targets for more effective epilepsy treatments. The keywords GPR39, GPR40, epilepsy, seizure, convulsive, and GPCRs were used to search PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This review explores recent insights into the roles of specific GPCR families in initiating, spreading, or attenuating seizures. It also discusses challenges in developing GPCR-targeted therapies and suggests strategies to overcome these obstacles. A particular focus is placed on GPR39 and GPR40, highlighting their roles in seizure modulation and their potential to prevent epileptogenesis and neuroinflammation. However, more research is necessary to clarify uncertainties regarding how ligand interactions with GPCRs affect physiological and therapeutic outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects around 1-2% of the global population, and current medications often have significant side effects or fail to control seizures effectively. The researchers reviewed existing scientific evidence to understand how these receptors, which are part of a larger family of receptors called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), may play a role in the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy. 

The review suggests that activating or modulating GPR39 and GPR40 could help regulate neuronal excitability, reduce neuroinflammation, and restore the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain - key factors that contribute to seizures. While more research is still needed to fully understand how these receptors function and how they could be targeted therapeutically, the findings indicate that GPR39 and GPR40 represent promising new avenues for developing safer, more effective epilepsy treatments.

We aimed to evaluate the association between serum Hcy levels and the risk of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis in a large, diverse population, accounting for clinical confounders and effect modifiers such as sex and reproductive status.We analyzed 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 8253 adults (≥18 years) without hepatitis B/C, excessive alcohol use, or pregnancy. MASLD was defined using the fatty liver index (≥30), and fibrosis risk was assessed using age-adjusted Fibrosis-4 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score among MASLD subjects (N = 5328). Associations between serum Hcy and MASLD/fibrosis risk were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for confounders, with stratification by sex and menopausal status.Serum Hcy levels were higher among those with MASLD (fatty liver index ≥30), though the association was attenuated after covariate adjustment. Among MASLD individuals, those at higher fibrosis risk (based on Fibrosis-4 or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score) had significantly elevated Hcy levels. This association remained significant in men and postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women.Elevated serum Hcy is independently associated with hepatic fibrosis risk in MASLD, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.

MASLD is a common condition where excess fat buildup in the liver can lead to inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), which can progress to more serious liver damage. 

The researchers analyzed data from a large, diverse group of adults in the United States, looking at their blood homocysteine levels and signs of liver fibrosis. They found that people with MASLD who had higher homocysteine levels were more likely to have a higher risk of advanced liver fibrosis. This association was particularly strong in men and women after menopause, but not in women before menopause. 

These findings suggest that elevated homocysteine may be an important factor contributing to the development of liver fibrosis in MASLD. Understanding this relationship could help identify individuals at higher risk and guide potential treatments targeting homocysteine to prevent or slow the progression of liver disease. However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and determine if lowering homocysteine levels can actually improve liver health,",,

Similarly, AI has been applied to surgical education research, creating a need to assess the relevance and applicability of existing guidelines in this context. This narrative review synthesized guidelines and checklists related to AI in surgical education, providing researchers with an introductory roadmap for conducting rigorous, reproducible studies and identifying gaps for future framework development.In April 2024, the authors conducted a search using Ovid (Embase and MEDLINE(R)) from 1946 to 2024 to identify guidelines and checklists related to AI research in healthcare and surgical education. Search teams included ""artifical intelligence"" and related terms, as well as ""checklist"", ""recommendations"", and terms related to evaluation, reporting, and guidelines. Titles and abstracts were screened and the authors reviewed eligible full-text articles for inclusion through consensus discussions.From 200 studies identified, 47 full-text articles were reviewed, and 16 guidelines and checklists were included. These were grouped into six thematic categories: AI research with health education applications, Generative AI and Large Language Model studies, machine learning/prediction models, AI in imaging, and forthcoming guidelines. Key findings highlighted the diversity in purpose, methodology, and scope. Although gaps were identified in existing guidelines and checklists for surgical education, with only one tailored to AI research in healthcare education, the authors demonstrated how these other resources could be applied.This review highlighted that while existing guidelines and checklists could be applied in certain contexts, significant gaps remained in education-specific research guidance. Future efforts should focus on developing tailored guidelines to address the unique challenges and opportunities of AI integration in surgical education, ensuring rigorous and reproducible research.Copyright © 2025 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

41193370,2026-01-02,Comparative Survival in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer by Volume of Disease and Timing of Metastasis: A Living Network Meta-analysis.,"We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of contemporary systemic treatment options across patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) across clinically relevant prognostic subgroups (synchronous high [SHV] and low [SLV] volume, and metachronous high [MHV] and low [MLV] volume).This living network meta-analysis was conducted using the living interactive evidence (LIvE) synthesis framework. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing treatment intensification with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), docetaxel (D), or both were included. Mixed treatment comparisons were conducted for overall population and for each prognostic subgroup (SHV, SLV, MHV, and MLV). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were assessed.The current report of a living systematic review includes a total of 11 trials (12 668 patients and 12 unique treatments). In the overall population, the results were consistent with those of a previous report. An analysis of OS by prespecified subgroups included nine clinical trials (8990 patients and eight unique treatments). In the SHV subgroup (N = 5171; 57%), ARPI + D + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with D + ADT (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.83) and ARPI + ADT (0.71; 0.53-0.97). In the SLV subgroup (N = 2455; 27%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.65; 0.52-0.80). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.08; 0.65-1.79). In the MHV subgroup (N = 589; 6.5%), no statistically significant improvement was observed with ARPI + D + ADT compared with ARPI + ADT (0.89; 0.43-1.85) and D + ADT (0.90; 0.60-1.36). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + ADT and D + ADT (1.02; 0.45-2.28). In the MLV subgroup (N = 775; 8.5%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.43; 0.29-0.64) and D + ADT (0.41; 0.24-0.70). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.56; 0.40-6.25). Inherent limitations of this analysis include the inability to account for all relevant variables such as the patient- and cancer-related factors that likely influenced the decision of physicians to offer docetaxel to patients.Current evidence suggests that triplet systemic therapy is preferred for patients with SHV mHSPC who are fit for docetaxel. Androgen receptor pathway doublet therapy is preferred for all other patient subgroups compared with ADT alone. There is no role of docetaxel doublet in patients with access to ARPI therapy and if they are able to receive it.Copyright © 2025.

41189469,2026-01-02,Senotherapeutics for metabolic disease and diabetic complications.,"Metabolic diseases, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome, are increasingly prevalent worldwide, driven by sedentary lifestyles, aging populations, and complex genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally understood as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, a growing body of evidence now implicates cellular senescence as a central, age-related contributor to metabolic dysfunction. Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in key metabolic tissues where they disrupt tissue function through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic secretome. SASP factors exacerbate insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and tissue remodeling, advancing the progression and complications of metabolic diseases. These insights have catalyzed the development of senotherapeutics, a class of interventions that includes senolytics (to eliminate SCs), senomorphics (to suppress SASP), and senosensitizers (to render resistant SCs more vulnerable to clearance). Although preclinical studies show promise, translation into clinical practice faces significant challenges, including identifying reliable biomarkers, understanding SC heterogeneity, and optimizing treatment timing and safety. As research advances, senotherapeutics may offer a transformative approach not only to managing metabolic diseases but also to mitigating associated comorbidities. The recognition that antidiabetic agents already in clinical use can modulate key features of senescence highlights a unique translational opportunity, suggesting that prevention of age-related metabolic disorders may be achievable with therapies already available in routine clinical practice. Medicine is poised to enter a new era in which targeting cellular senescence could fundamentally reshape the prevention and treatment of age-related metabolic disorders, offering the potential for improved healthspan and reduced disease burden across the lifespan.© 2025 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.",Journal of internal medicine,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Allyson K Palmer|Rosa Spinelli|Larissa GL Prata|Selim Chaib|Masayoshi Suda|Tamar Tchkonia|Ulf Smith|James L Kirkland,Allyson K Palmer,"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.|Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.|Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.","Allyson K Palmer, Rosa Spinelli, Larissa GL Prata, Selim Chaib, Masayoshi Suda, Tamar Tchkonia, Ulf Smith, James L Kirkland",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41189469/,"Metabolic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are becoming more common worldwide due to factors like sedentary lifestyles and aging populations.

41187859,2026-01-02,Frequent EPHA2 receptor mutations in cholangiocarcinoma disrupt receptor forward signaling supporting a tumor suppressor role.,"Although EPHA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase widely expressed in many cancers, it exhibits a uniquely high frequency of coding sequence mutations in cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the biliary tract with dismal prognosis. EPHA2 is extensively studied, but very little is known about the role of EPHA2 cancer mutations. To define the functional significance of EPHA2 mutations in biliary tract cancers, we generated representative EPHA2 mutants and monitored major receptor autophosphorylation sites as indicators of kinase activity-dependent signal transduction (known as forward signaling). We found that missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain abrogate ephrinA ligand binding, while missense mutations in the kinase domain abrogate kinase activity. The effects of missense mutations in other domains were less pronounced and varied depending on the phosphosite. The majority of the EPHA2 mutations are nonsense or frame-shift mutations that introduce early stop codons. They generate EPHA2 truncated forms that lack an intact kinase domain or, in some cases, most of the coding sequence. Several EPHA2 mutants tested inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of co-expressed EPHA2 wild-type, indicating the ability to exert dominant negative effects. We show that EPHA2 forward signaling in cholangiocytes inhibits the ERK oncogenic pathway and cell proliferation, suggesting that loss-of-function mutations facilitate tumor development in the biliary tract. Indeed, an EPHA2 kinase-inactive mutant, but not EPHA2 wild-type, induced proliferative masses consistent with well differentiated cholangiocarcinoma in a validated mouse model of cholangiocarcinogenesis. Thus, EPHA2 has the attributes of a driver gene with tumor suppressor activity in biliary tract cancers.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The median age at cyst detection and removal were 4.8 months (IQR 3.6-9.6) and 1.8 years (IQR 0.9-5.3), respectively. In 42 patients, parents have noticed the presence of the cyst immediately after birth. Cyst wall rupture during surgical removal was reported in 15.4%. The median follow-up time was 1.3 months (IQR 0.5-12.2). Three patients experienced recurrence. No postoperative complication was reported. The regions with the highest prevalence of ICE were the forehead, frontotemporal scalp, and nasal region. The lateral frontal/temporal scalp had a 33.3% rate of ICE. Midline forehead/scalp lesions demonstrated a higher risk of ICE compared to their lateral equivalents (54.5% vs 17.5%, P = .03).

41364602,2026-01-02,Weekly Comprehensive Assessments for Optimizing Care of Patients With a Discharge Delay.,"The purpose of this project was to explore patient safety, quality outcomes, and staff satisfaction related to decreasing comprehensive patient assessments to once weekly for patients with a discharge delay.The project involved piloting once-weekly comprehensive assessments for medically stable patients on a general medical-surgical unit and a long-stay unit. The pilots aimed to reduce the frequency of comprehensive assessments while maintaining patient safety, reducing patient interruptions, and improving staff satisfaction.The pilot for the general medical-surgical unit had low compliance and was discontinued. However, the pilot in the long-stay unit was successful, saving nurses an estimated 3534 minutes per week. Several measured quality indicators improved, although there were small increases in hospital-acquired pressure injuries and Clostridioides difficile infections.

The researchers piloted a program where medically stable patients received comprehensive assessments just once per week, rather than the usual daily or every-other-day schedule. The study was conducted on a general medical-surgical unit and a long-stay unit. While the medical-surgical pilot was discontinued due to low compliance, the long-stay unit pilot was successful. It saved nurses an estimated 3,500 minutes per week, and several quality measures improved, though there were small increases in some hospital-acquired infections. Importantly, 87.5% of nurses supported continuing the weekly assessment schedule. This suggests that reducing assessment frequency can benefit both patients and staff, without compromising safety, for individuals who are medically stable but experiencing delays in being discharged from the hospital. The findings indicate this approach could be implemented in other healthcare settings, as long as appropriate patient monitoring is maintained. This research highlights an opportunity to improve efficiency and staff satisfaction in hospital care, which could have meaningful impacts for patients and the healthcare system.",,
41289513,2026-01-02,Sustainability of Complex Interventions: Recommendations From a Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Manage Cancer Symptoms.,"Sustained implementation of evidence-based practices and interventions in clinical settings is essential to ensure patients receive the best evidence-informed care. Information to guide sustainment of complex, multicomponent interventions in routine clinical practice after grant funding ends has had limited attention in the literature.The purpose of this article is to describe the efforts of our multidisciplinary trial team to foster sustainment of key components of a complex electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated symptom surveillance and management intervention for people receiving cancer care at a Midwestern quaternary medical center or community practice settings.The parent Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial assessed the effectiveness of a multicomponent EHR-facilitated, collaborative care model-based intervention for management of SPPADE symptoms (sleep interference, pain, impaired physical function, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit/fatigue) and its implementation in medical oncology and community practice settings. The dynamic sustainability framework (DSF) posits the need for on-going efforts to continuously optimize the fit of an intervention within dynamic and evolving delivery contexts. This brief report uses the DSF to describe our team's efforts to optimize the fit of the core E2C2 intervention components to the practice setting and broader ecological system during the conduct of the trial. These activities were designed to achieve sustained implementation of the intervention in routine care delivery as the funded research activities concluded.Core intervention components to be sustained were symptom surveillance using electronic patient-reported outcome measures, clinician alerts for severe symptoms, access to a registered nurse symptom care manager (RN SCM) for severe symptoms, patient education materials to support symptom self-management, access to a website of cancer-related materials, and the training and supervision of the RN SCMs.Sustainability is dynamic and multidimensional, and emphasizes the importance of optimizing the fit of key intervention components to the care delivery context as it evolves time. Investigators are advised to plan sustainability efforts early, embrace change inherent in dynamic settings, and carefully track adaptations of intervention components to maximize intervention fit in real-world clinical practice to ensure patients continue to derive benefit from evidence-informed care.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

The researchers studied a complex intervention that used electronic health records and a nurse care manager to help cancer patients better manage symptoms like pain, fatigue, and anxiety. The study was a ""pragmatic clinical trial"" - a real-world test of the intervention in medical oncology clinics and community practices. The researchers used a framework called the ""dynamic sustainability framework"" to guide their efforts to adapt the intervention to fit the needs of each clinic over time. This helped ensure the key components, like symptom tracking and nurse support, could be sustained in routine clinical care. The findings show that proactively planning for sustainability, embracing changes in the healthcare setting, and tailoring the intervention are crucial for maintaining the benefits of evidence-based practices long-term. This is important because it helps cancer patients continue receiving the best possible care, even as healthcare systems and funding sources evolve. A limitation is that the study was conducted at a single healthcare system, so more research is needed to see if the approach works in other settings.",,
38349134,2026-01-02,The Association and Utility of Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure in Predicting the Development of and in Managing Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a significant complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography, and its development is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) provides one index of left heart filling status. An elevated LVEDP can reflect volume overload or abnormal diastolic function and indicates a cardiac disorder. Data on the association between an elevated LVEDP and CIN are limited and have had conflicting results. We systematically searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for full-text articles from database inception to May 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated the association between a high LVEDP and the incidence of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The study was registered in the PROSPERO CRD42022334070. A second search in PubMed identified randomized controlled trials using LVEDP to guide fluid administration during coronary procedures. Four studies were identified that used LVEDP to classify patients into groups to determine the association between the level and the development of CIN. In these studies, 240 patients of 2441 patients (9.8%) developed CIN. One study found no association between LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. Two studies found an increased frequency of CIN in patients with elevated levels using 2 cutoff points for LVEDP, ≥20 mm Hg and >30 mm Hg. One study found that lower LVEDP levels (5-14 mm Hg) were associated with the development of CIN. Three randomized control trials used LVDEP levels to manage fluid administration in patients undergoing coronary procedures; only one study found that the use of these levels to guide fluid administration resulted in better outcomes. In patients undergoing coronary angiography, an elevated LVEDP was not consistently associated with increased risk of CIN, and using LVEDP levels to guide fluid administration during these procedures did not always improve outcomes in comparison to other protocols. The use of LVEDP levels can help classify patients with cardiac disorders but does not necessarily provide an adequate description of the hemodynamic patterns in these patients to predict or prevent CIN in patients undergoing angiography.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This research looked at whether measuring a specific heart function marker, called left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), could help predict and manage the risk of CIN in these patients.

The researchers reviewed several studies that examined the link between high LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. They found mixed results - some studies showed a higher risk of CIN in patients with elevated LVEDP, while others found no association or even a link between lower LVEDP and CIN. The researchers also looked at studies that used LVEDP to guide fluid management during coronary procedures, but again the results were inconsistent, with only one study showing improved outcomes.

Overall, this research suggests that while LVEDP can provide information about a patient's heart function, it does not reliably predict or prevent the occurrence of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

38230923,2026-01-02,Endocardial Fibroelastosis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Endocardial fibroelastosis emerged as a challenging clinical phenomenon in the 1940s. It is characterized by an atypical proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue within the heart and is primarily observed in childhood, occasionally displaying familial inheritance. While the precise cause remains elusive, various factors, including genetic, infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, oncologic, and medication-related influences, appear to play a role in its pathogenesis. The coexistence of endocardial fibroelastosis with multiple cardiac structural abnormalities manifests in symptoms of congestive heart failure and rhythm abnormalities. Despite its challenging diagnosis, various findings from ECG and imaging have proven beneficial in further evaluation of this condition. Finally, the treatment approach to endocardial fibroelastosis became complex due to addressing its concurrent cardiac abnormalities. Strategies for managing and preventing this condition are still under investigation. In this review, we intend to highlight the existing knowledge and illuminate future considerations regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To investigate this, we interrogated 44 whole genome and exome sequencing data from 34 patients with t(11;14) MM treated with venetoclax. The presence of mutations in the RAS pathway was strongly associated with shortened progression-free survival (PFS) and was validated in an independent cohort of 21 MM patients. Presence of 1q gain was also associated with shorter PFS in patients without RAS mutations. In 10 patients with paired, pre- and post-venetoclax treatment samples, post-venetoclax progression was recurrently driven by the selection of genomic events in BCL2/MCL1 and RAS pathways and of high-risk features (e.g., loss of TP53 and CDKN2C).

41481368,2026-01-03,The Renal miRNA Expression Profile of Pkd1RC/RC Mice Changes Longitudinally with the Progression of the Disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of bilateral kidney cysts, which often leads to kidney failure. This study comprehensively characterized the expression profile of miRNAs and their target genes in Pkd1RC/RC mice and further compared them with other murine models of PKD and a model of CKD, and individuals with ADPKD.Pkd1RC/RC and WT mice (n=10 each, 5 males and 5 females) were studied at 1, 6, and 12 months. At each time point, kidney volume was determined in vivo (MRI), followed by ex vivo histomorphometric analyses. In randomly selected Pkd1RC/RC and WT mouse kidneys (n=5/genotype, at 1 and 12 months), miRNA-sequencing (seq) was performed, followed by mRNA-seq, integrated (miRNA-seq/mRNA-seq analysis), and functional analysis of miRNA target genes. Venn diagrams were constructed to identify overlapping and novel differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in Pkd1RC/RC and other commonly used murine models of PKD, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and individuals with ADPKD.miRNA-seq analysis identified 41 and 181 miRNAs DE in Pkd1RC/RC versus WT kidneys at 1 and 12 months, respectively, which were confirmed by qPCR. Target genes of miRNAs DE in Pkd1RC/RC at early stages encoded for proteins mainly implicated in cell proliferation and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) transport, whereas those DE at late stages encoded for transport proteins involved in pro-inflammatory and metabolic processes. Urine α-KG concentration (1H NMR spectroscopy), its fractional excretion, and tissue levels were higher in Pkd1RC/RC during the entire course of the disease and associated with decreased protein expression of α-KG transporters NaDC3 and Oat1. We further identified common DE miRNAs among murine models of PKD, DKD and previous reports in individuals with ADPKD, as well as several novel miRNAs DE in early and late Pkd1RC/RC kidneys, which have not been previously reported in either other murine models of PKD or patients with ADPKD.Our study demonstrates that the renal miRNA expression profile changes longitudinally with the progression of the disease, and might suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of α-KG transport could represent a novel early feature of the disease.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

41290367,2026-01-03,Outcomes of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE in Patients with Metastatic Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has emerged as a promising treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (mPPGL). This study aimed to evaluate PRRT outcomes in patients with mPPGL in a single institution. Methods: Records of patients with mPPGL who received PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes of interest were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), symptomatic benefit, hypertension control, and treatment-related toxicity. ORR included complete response and partial response, whereas DCR encompassed complete response, partial response, and stable disease, determined using RECIST 1.1. Symptomatic benefit was defined as patient-reported symptom improvement relative to baseline. Hypertension control was assessed on the basis of adjustments in antihypertensive medication requirements. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Overall survival and progression-free survival were also evaluated. Results: Of the 15 patients included in our study, 7 (47%) had paraganglioma and 8 (53%) had pheochromocytoma. The mean follow-up duration was 28.4 ± 19.3 mo. PRRT was the initial systemic therapy in 2 patients (13%), and 2 treated with PRRT (13%) underwent retreatment, receiving 8 cycles. Two patients (13%) discontinued PRRT because of disease progression, and the remaining 13 patients (87%) completed all 4 cycles. The ORR was 27%, and the DCR was 73%, including 7 patients with stable disease and 4 with a partial response. The mean PRRT response duration was 16.2 ± 14.2 mo. A reduction in dose or no escalation of antihypertensive therapy was observed in 13 patients (87%). Ten patients (67%) reported symptom improvement. The most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 anemia and leukopenia (40%). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities occurred in 2 patients (13%), including 1 with thrombocytopenia (7%) and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome (7%). No moderate or severe nephrotoxicity was observed. Hypertensive crises occurred in 2 patients (13%), 1 with a prior history of such events. The median overall survival was 54.8 mo (95% CI, 6.8-102.8 mo), and the median progression-free survival was 26.9 mo (95% CI, 13.3-40.5 mo). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PRRT remains a therapeutic strategy for mPPGL, is well-tolerated, and may improve cancer-related symptoms.

These cancers develop in the body's hormone-producing glands and can spread to other organs. The researchers looked at the outcomes of using a specialized radiation therapy called peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 15 patients with these metastatic cancers. 

The PRRT treatment involves injecting radioactive molecules that target and destroy cancer cells. The researchers found that PRRT was generally well-tolerated, with most patients experiencing only mild side effects like anemia and low white blood cell counts. Over two-thirds of patients showed disease stabilization or partial shrinkage of their tumors, and many reported improvements in their cancer-related symptoms. The treatment also helped control high blood pressure, a common complication of these cancers. While the overall survival time was variable, the results suggest PRRT could be a valuable option for managing metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma when other treatments fail.

41206919,2026-01-03,A proposed path to explaining the unexplained anemia of aging.,"Approximately 17% of people aged 65 years and older are anemic, and 10% of death certificates report anemia as a secondary cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, anemia remains unexplained in 30%-50% of older adults. This unexplained anemia of aging (UAA) is a diagnosis of exclusion. The mechanism, impact, and progression of UAA remain unknown. At older ages, anemia adds to pre-existing co-morbidities with significant adverse health consequences, representing a compelling unmet clinical concern. The National Institute on Aging held a workshop in 2024 to discuss current knowledge and research opportunities. Topics included the epidemiology of anemia at older age and its clinical implications; probable mechanism(s) underlying UAA, that is, low-grade inflammation's effects on erythropoiesis; the role of microbiota in iron regulation in bone marrow; the importance of ruling out a diagnosis of leukemic clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which is more prevalent in older age; the role of senescence and aging governing hematopoiesis; and the effects of sex hormones on hematopoietic stem cell aging. Understanding the roles of these factors could reduce the proportion of the older anemic population whose anemia remains unexplained and offer insights into new potential diagnostic and intervention strategies. Speakers reviewed previous clinical trials in patients with UAA and CH. They discussed lessons learned and future research priorities, including efforts to develop new diagnostic algorithms and potential uses of machine learning.© The Author(s) 2025.

The researchers studied a family with several members who developed a unique syndrome characterized by loss of body fat (lipodystrophy), abnormal fat deposits (lipomatosis), severe liver inflammation in infancy (infantile steatohepatitis), and low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). By analyzing the genetic makeup of this family, the researchers identified a specific mutation in the ACAA2 gene as the underlying cause of this disorder. 

The ACAA2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in fat metabolism. This genetic variant appears to disrupt the normal function of this enzyme, leading to the accumulation of certain fat byproducts in the body and the development of the observed medical problems. Understanding the genetic basis of this rare syndrome is an important step towards improving diagnosis and potentially developing targeted treatments for affected individuals. While more research is needed, this discovery provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetics, fat metabolism, and liver health that can manifest as a debilitating condition during childhood and adulthood.",Gastroenterology,
41484090,2026-01-04,Elevated non-clonal bone marrow plasma cell fraction at diagnosis is associated with improved outcomes in multiple myeloma.,"In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), current risk stratification relies on cytogenetics and disease burden, but emerging immune parameters may refine prognosis. While a higher non-clonal plasma cell fraction (NCPF) predicts favorable outcomes in smoldering myeloma, its relevance in NDMM remains unexplored. We retrospectively analyzed 798 patients with NDMM where baseline bone marrow aspirates were tested to determine the NCPF, defined as the proportion of non-clonal plasma cells among total plasma cells. An NCPF ≥ 5% defined the NCPF-Enriched group. NCPF-High was observed in 124 patients (15.5% of all cohort). Compared to NCPF-Low, NCPF-Enriched patients had lower overall bone marrow plasma cell burden (median 20% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001), higher rates of hyperdiploidy (71% vs. 59%, p = 0.025), and similar cytogenetic risk. Six-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in NCPF-Enriched (70.3% vs. 56.5%, p = 0.0096), with independent prognostic value in multivariable analysis (HR 0.64, p = 0.03). Progression-free survival was also superior (HR 0.69, p = 0.006) in the NCPF-Enriched cohort in the setting of comparable treatment approaches. A higher non-clonal plasma cell fraction at diagnosis is independently associated with improved outcomes in NDMM, highlighting its potential as a novel immune prognostic biomarker warranting further investigation.© 2026.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against children (SVAC) are two major forms of such abuse. Despite their wide-reaching effects on individual and community health, these risk factors have not been adequately prioritised as key drivers of global health burden. Comprehensive x§and reliable estimates of the comparative health burden of IPV and SVAC are urgently needed to inform investments in prevention and support for survivors at both national and global levels.We estimated the prevalence and attributable burden of IPV among females and SVAC among males and females for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2023, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2023. We searched several global databases for data on self-reported exposure to IPV and SVAC and undertook a systematic review to identify the health outcomes associated with each of these risk factors. We modelled IPV and SVAC prevalence using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, applying data adjustments to account for measurement heterogeneity. We employed burden-of-proof methodology to estimate relative risks for outcomes associated with IPV and SVAC. These estimates informed the calculation of population attributable fractions, which were then used to quantify disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to each risk factor.Globally, in 2023, we estimated that 608 million (95% uncertainty interval 518-724) females aged 15 years and older had ever been exposed to IPV, and 1·01 billion (0·764-1·48) individuals aged 15 years and older had experienced sexual violence during childhood. 18·5 million (8·74-30·0) DALYs were attributed to IPV among females and 32·2 million (16·4-52·5) DALYs were attributed to SVAC among males and females in 2023. IPV and SVAC were among the top contributors to the global disease burden in 2023, particularly among females aged 15-49 years, ranking as the fourth and fifth leading risk factors, respectively, for DALYs in this group. Among the eight health outcomes found to be associated with IPV, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder were the leading causes of IPV-attributed DALYs, accounting for 5·43 million (-1·25 to 14·6) and 3·96 million (1·71 to 6·92) DALYs in 2023, respectively. SVAC was associated with 14 health outcomes, including mental health disorder, substance use disorder, and chronic and infectious disease outcomes. Self-harm and schizophrenia were the leading causes of SVAC-attributed burden, with SVAC accounting for 6·71 million (2·00 to 12·7) DALYs due to self-harm and 4·15 million (-1·92 to 13·1) DALYs due to schizophrenia in 2023.IPV and SVAC are substantial contributors to global health burden, and their health consequences span a variety of individual health outcomes. Importantly, mental health disorders account for the greatest share of disease burden among survivors. Investing in prevention of these avoidable risk factors has the potential to avert millions of DALYs and considerable premature mortality each year. Our findings represent strong evidence for global and national leaders to elevate IPV and SVAC among public health priorities. Sustained investments are needed to prevent IPV and SVAC and to implement interventions focused on supporting the complex social and health needs of survivors.Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

Safety data on revaccination among people with previous cardiac AEFIs are lacking. This study assessed outcomes of COVID-19 revaccination among participants assessed for cardiac AEFIs.The Special Immunization Clinic Network database, containing data from consented participants across twelve sites, was analyzed. Cases were classified using the Brighton Collaboration Case Definitions (BCCDs) for mutually exclusive diagnoses of myocarditis, myopericarditis or pericarditis. Subjects with cardiac symptoms not meeting the BCCD and with no alternative diagnosis were categorized as chest pain/other cardiac diagnosis. Revaccination recommendations were based on physician judgment, informed by national guidelines. Participants were followed up to 42 days after revaccination to capture AEFI recurrence.Between January 1, 2021 and February 23, 2023, 114 participants were enrolled, including 46 with myocarditis (40.4 %), 26 (22.8 %) with myopericarditis, 11 (9.6 %) with pericarditis, and 31 (27.1 %) with chest pain/other cardiac diagnosis. Twenty-seven of 71 participants (38.0 %) who required further COVID-19 vaccine doses were recommended for revaccination.

41485178,2026-01-05,Psilocybin and Bipolar Depression: Promise and Prudence.,"Bipolar disorder affects approximately 40 million individuals worldwide, with depression being the most prominent phase of the illness. Owing to limited treatment options, bipolar depression remains a major public health concern, often causing significant functional impairment and increased suicide risk. Current therapies frequently lack rapid effectiveness, highlighting the need for novel approaches. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound receiving growing interest for its potential rapid antidepressant effects, is under investigation in clinical trials combined with psychotherapy. Early studies in bipolar II disorder (n = 19) show encouraging results, but evidence is still limited, and important safety concerns such as affective switching and pharmacokinetic interactions persist. Additional challenges include regulatory restrictions, infrastructure demands, and uncertainties about the role of the psychedelic experience, especially given possible interference by common bipolar medications. Cautious, rigorous research is essential to determine psilocybin's safety, efficacy, and practical application in bipolar depression, particularly for bipolar I disorder and long-term outcomes.© 2026.

While some inflammatory responses may originate from mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), nonimmune cells vastly outnumber MNPs and may be an important source of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that highly virulent EBOV induced a high and sustained pro-inflammatory response compared to less virulent ebolaviruses in non-MNPs through TLR4-independent NF-κB activation. We identified the EBOV matrix protein VP40 as a potent activator of NF-κB in non-MNPs, whose intrinsic inflammatory activation ability is higher than VP40 proteins from less virulent ebolaviruses. This suggests that VP40 is a virulence determinant inducing distinct degrees of pro-inflammatory responses among ebolaviruses. Mechanistically, VP40 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, primarily via TNFR1 using a ligand-independent mechanism. These findings reveal mechanisms that may drive systemic inflammation and promote EBOV pathogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate immune dysregulation in severe EBOV infections.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Satoko Yamaoka|Zeineb M'Hamdi|Lin Wang|Vaille A Swenson|Kristin L McNally|Shao-Chia C Lu|Reema Singh|Stephanie L Saundh|Brady N Zell|Sonja M Best|Michael A Barry|Angela L Rasmussen|Hideki Ebihara,Satoko Yamaoka|Lin Wang|Vaille A Swenson|Shao-Chia C Lu|Brady N Zell|Michael A Barry,"Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E3, Canada.|Virology and Gene Therapy Track, Mayo Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, MN 55905.|Laboratory of Virology, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840.|Laboratory of Neurological Infections and Immunity, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E3, Canada.|Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794.|Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan Institute for Health Security, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan.","Satoko Yamaoka, Zeineb M'Hamdi, Lin Wang, Vaille A Swenson, Kristin L McNally, Shao-Chia C Lu, Reema Singh, Stephanie L Saundh, Brady N Zell, Sonja M Best, Michael A Barry, Angela L Rasmussen, Hideki Ebihara",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461033/,"Ebola is a deadly virus that causes severe illness and often leads to death.

41130385,2026-01-06,Comparative performance of Scribe and database search engines in metaproteomic profiling of a ground-truth microbiome dataset.,"Mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics, the identification and quantification of thousands of proteins expressed by complex microbial communities, has become pivotal for unraveling functional interactions within microbiomes. However, metaproteomics data analysis encounters many challenges, including the search of tandem mass spectra against a protein sequence database using proteomics database search algorithms. We used a ground-truth dataset to assess a spectral library searching method against established database searching approaches. Mass spectrometry data collected by data-dependent acquisition (DDA-MS) was analyzed using database searching approaches (MaxQuant and FragPipe), as well as using Scribe with Prosit predicted spectral libraries. We used FASTA databases that included protein sequences from microbial species present in the ground-truth dataset along with background protein sequences, to estimate error rates and assess the effects on detection, peptide-spectral match quality, and quantification. Using the Scribe search engine resulted in more proteins detected at a 1 % false discovery rate (FDR) compared to MaxQuant or FragPipe, while FragPipe detected more peptides verified by PepQuery. Scribe was able to detect more low-abundance proteins in the microbiome dataset and was more accurate in quantifying the microbial community composition. This research provides insights and guidance for metaproteomics researchers aiming to optimize results in their analysis of DDA-MS data. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Metaproteomics requires a balance between high numbers of peptide and protein identification and confidence in the accuracy of the identifications made. We demonstrate the utility of the Scribe search engine for metaproteomics applications, as it was found to detect low-abundance proteins with accurate quantitation than other DDA-MS search engines. This tool has great utility for both novel metaproteomics studies as well as hypothesis-generating experiments using previously acquired open source proteomics raw data.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers wanted to create a 3D computer simulation that generates highly detailed, lifelike ultrasound images from CT scans of the patient's anatomy. 

They used a progressive training approach, starting with basic simulations and gradually increasing the complexity to match real-world conditions. This allowed them to build an advanced simulator that can accurately mimic the appearance and behavior of organs, tissues, and kidney stones during the procedure. By training on this realistic 3D model, doctors can hone their skills and become more confident before operating on a real patient.

Patient osteoporosis status was determined according to the National Bone Health Alliance criteria. We report survival free from revision (implant removal or replacement) and all-cause reoperation (including revisions) in these groups. We used cluster-robust, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to analyze osteoporosis as a risk factor for revision and all-cause reoperation and report subgroup analysis for pyrocarbon and silicone implants.The osteoporosis group included 200 joints (168 silicone, 32 pyrocarbon) in 56 patients with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years. The nonosteoporosis group included 129 joints (93 silicone, 36 pyrocarbon) in 42 patients with a mean follow-up of 10 years. With pyrocarbon implants, the osteoporosis group had lower 10-year survival free from revision (58% vs 100%) and all-cause reoperation (40% vs. 81%) than the nonosteoporosis group. In multivariable analysis of pyrocarbon implants, osteoporosis was associated with increased hazard for revision (HR, 11.0; 95% CI, 1.27-95.8) and all-cause reoperation (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-10.3). With silicone implants, there was no difference in 10-year survival free from revision (88% in osteoporosis, 89% in nonosteoporosis) or all-cause reoperation (85% osteoporosis, 85% nonosteoporosis). Osteoporosis did not affect risk for silicone implant revision or reoperation.Osteoporosis is associated with increased risk for pyrocarbon implant revision and all-cause reoperation in RA patients, though the precise effect size is unknown.

Limited in vitro data suggest compatibility of 0.05% CHG with antibiotic impregnated IPP devices; however, very little clinical research exists to guide use of 0.05% CHG in this population.Assess the relationship of 0.05% CHG and antibiotic impregnated IPP infection in a large multi-institutional cohort.We retrospectively reviewed a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent antibiotic impregnated IPP implantation. We identified cases using intraoperative 0.05% CHG and an equal number of consecutive control cases without 0.05% CHG use from each center for comparison. The primary outcome was IPP infection requiring explantation. Patient demographics and surgical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression to identify variables associated with infection.The primary outcome was IPP infection requiring device explanation.Among 14 participating institutions, 761 cases using an antibiotic impregnated IPP were analyzed. Of these, 348 (45.7%) had 0.05% CHG used during the case. Median follow-up was 4 months (interquartile range 1-12) for the 0.05% CHG group and 8 months (interquartile range 2-21) for the control group.Intraoperative 0.05% CHG utilization was not associated with antibiotic impregnated IPP infection rate (1.9% vs. 2.0%, P = .9). On multivariable analysis, prior IPP infection (OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.32-30.2, P = .021) and prior priapism (OR 10.01, 95% CI 1.18-89.7, P = .039) were associated with increased infection risk.The use of 0.05% CHG irrigation with antibiotic impregnated IPPs was associated with similar infection rates compared to antibiotic irrigation.Limitations include the use of a historical comparator cohort which may introduce unknown confounders, practice variation between multiple sites, shorter follow-up in the 0.05% CHG cohort, and the low incidence of IPP infection which may limit statistical power despite a large sample.

These studies serve multiple epidemiological purposes: characterizing population health, monitoring temporal trends through repeated surveys, and evaluating interventions via interrupted time series designs. They also offer practical advantages for validating self-reported measures and creating diagnostic models. Cross-sectional designs are efficient and well-suited to descriptive epidemiology, but they have limited utility for causal inference. The simultaneous measurement of exposures and outcomes creates temporal ambiguity that fundamentally constrains etiologic interpretation. However, causal inferences can be strengthened under specific conditions-when temporal sequence is unambiguous (e.g., genetic variants preceding outcomes) or when valid instrumental variables are available.

Tissue biopsies involved by ECD are difficult to distinguish from reactive inflammatory infiltrates given the bland appearance of the neoplastic histiocytes. Confirmation of the ECD diagnosis often relies on molecular studies to confirm BRAF V600E mutation or other activating mutations involving MAPK pathway genes. In this study, we examined the diagnostic utility of cyclin D1 and pERK as immunohistochemical markers of MAPK pathway activation in ECD compared with its histopathologic mimics. The cohort included 41 clinically confirmed ECD patients, most with known genetic alterations in MAPK pathway genes (n=38). In 3 cases no mutation was identified. 37 of 41 (90%) of ECD cases showed cyclin D1 overexpression, with frequent staining in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. pERK expression was observed in 32 of 39 (82%) cases. Cyclin D1 staining was negative in histopathologic mimics of ECD, apart from weak patchy staining in fat necrosis and uniform staining in a subset of cases of juvenile/adult xanthogranuloma. While not entirely sensitive or specific, in the proper clinical and radiologic context strong nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin D1 expression within histiocytic infiltrates helps to support a diagnosis of ECD.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41059926,2026-01-07,Discovery and Validation of Molecular Biomarkers for Differentiation of Nondysplastic Barrett's Esophagus from High-grade Dysplasia and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,"Aberrant DNA methylation and copy-number alterations (CNA) drive Barrett's esophagus progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, their combined utility for early detection is unclear. We aimed to identify and validate methylated DNA markers (MDM) and CNAs to distinguish esophageal adenocarcinoma/high-grade dysplasia (HGD) from nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE). In this multiphase, multicenter study, we discovered and validated MDMs and quantified CNAs utilizing whole-genome methylation sequencing of esophageal brushings. DNA biomarkers identified from discovery were further validated in independent patients with paired esophageal brushing and swallowed capsule sponge samples. MDMs were filtered against a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset obtained from independent tissue samples to advance only concordant candidates. CNA burden was quantified using ichorCNA-derived aneuploidy scores (AS). Two hundred MDMs discovered in HGD (N = 18) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (N = 18) versus NDBE brushing samples (N = 18) were tested in independent samples (N = 146). A 52-MDM panel achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.95]; the addition of AS improved discrimination of HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from NDBE to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97) AUC. At 80% specificity, the combined model detected 93% of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 88% of HGD cases. In paired capsule sponge samples, a 58-MDM panel achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.88); a combined 58-MDM and AS model achieved AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.7-0.9). MDMs and AS discerned HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from normal esophagus/NDBE in endoscopic brushing and capsule sponge samples. This approach may improve Barrett's esophagus surveillance.This study demonstrates that combining epigenetic and genomic biomarkers across minimally invasive sampling methods can accurately distinguish HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, offering promising, less invasive strategies to improve BE surveillance and enable endoscopic therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma prevention and treatment.©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.","Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)","Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Calise K Berger|Caryn E Anderson|Melissa A Passe|Ramona M Lansing|Panwen Wang|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Jeanette E Eckel-Passow|Zhifu Sun|Douglas W Mahoney|D C Codipilly|Cadman L Leggett|Francisco C Ramirez|Allon Kahn|Herbert C Wolfsen|Swathi Eluri|Vani JA Konda|Arvind J Trindade|Prasad G Iyer|John B Kisiel,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Calise K Berger|Caryn E Anderson|Melissa A Passe|Ramona M Lansing|Panwen Wang|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Jeanette E Eckel-Passow|Zhifu Sun|Douglas W Mahoney|D C Codipilly|Cadman L Leggett|Francisco C Ramirez|Allon Kahn|Herbert C Wolfsen|Swathi Eluri|Prasad G Iyer|John B Kisiel,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.|Division of Computational Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor Scott and White Health, Dallas, Texas.|Division of Gastroenterology, Rutgers University School of Medicine, New Brunswick, New Jersey.","Caroline L Matchett, Seth W Slettedahl, William R Taylor, Calise K Berger, Caryn E Anderson, Melissa A Passe, Ramona M Lansing, Panwen Wang, Collin E Chalmers, Patrick H Foote, Jeanette E Eckel-Passow, Zhifu Sun, Douglas W Mahoney, D C Codipilly, Cadman L Leggett, Francisco C Ramirez, Allon Kahn, Herbert C Wolfsen, Swathi Eluri, Vani JA Konda, Arvind J Trindade, Prasad G Iyer, John B Kisiel",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41059926/,"This research aimed to identify and validate new biomarkers that can help distinguish a precancerous condition called high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal cancer from a less severe condition called nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE).

41143601,2026-01-07,Cell-of-Origin Subtype Predicts Response to Polatuzumab Vedotin in Large B-cell Lymphoma.,"Polatuzumab vedotin (polatuzumab) was approved for up-front treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (Pola-R-CHP) based on the POLARIX trial. However, when stratified by cell of origin (COO), polatuzumab seems to have greater efficacy in activated B-cell than germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype disease. Most studies of polatuzumab used RNA expression to assess COO, whereas in routine clinical practice, the immunohistochemistry-based Hans algorithm is used.To assess the impact of COO by immunohistochemistry on polatuzumab efficacy, we conducted a multicenter real-world study of adults with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) receiving polatuzumab from 2015 to 2024, split by receipt of polatuzumab in first-line versus relapsed/refractory settings. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) to polatuzumab-based treatment in GCB versus non-GCB relapsed/refractory LBCL.Of 740 patients, 305 received polatuzumab in the first-line setting and 435 in the relapsed/refractory setting. In the relapsed/refractory cohort, the ORR in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL was 59.7% versus 36.3% [OR, 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-3.84; P < 0.0001], with a complete response rate of 35.7% versus 17.7% (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.66-4.02; P < 0.0001). Progression-free survival was longer for patients with non-GCB versus GCB COO (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.5-0.83; P = 0.0006). In the first-line cohort, ORR, complete response rate, and progression-free survival were similar in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL, as hypothesized based on outcomes in the Pola-R-CHP arm of POLARIX, suggesting that the addition of polatuzumab overcomes the adverse risk of non-GCB COO in patients receiving R-CHOP.Based on these data, COO classification by the Hans algorithm is a strong predictor of polatuzumab efficacy in LBCL, informing real-world treatment decisions.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Edward RS Cliff|Guido D Pelaez|Fei Wan|Varun Iyengar|Jihao Zhou|Kevin Chung|Nayef Abdel-Razeq|Jessica Allen|Ajay Major|John Sharp|Narendranath Epperla|Patrick Gould|Hua-Jay J Cherng|Samin Houshyar|Danielle S Wallace|Ryan C Lynch|Avyakta Kallam|Matthew G Mei|Reid W Merryman|Michelle Fleyshman|Joanna M Rhodes|Adam Kidwell|Timothy S Fenske|Nikita Malakhov|Erin Mulvey|Marcus P Watkins|Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa|Talal Hilal|Grzegorz S Nowakowski|Yucai Wang|Pallawi Torka|David A Russler-Germain,Jihao Zhou|Kevin Chung|Nayef Abdel-Razeq|Samin Houshyar|Danielle S Wallace|Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa|Talal Hilal|Grzegorz S Nowakowski|Yucai Wang,"Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.|Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.|Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.|Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.|Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.|Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California.|Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Brunswick, New Jersey.|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.|Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.","Edward RS Cliff, Guido D Pelaez, Fei Wan, Varun Iyengar, Jihao Zhou, Kevin Chung, Nayef Abdel-Razeq, Jessica Allen, Ajay Major, John Sharp, Narendranath Epperla, Patrick Gould, Hua-Jay J Cherng, Samin Houshyar, Danielle S Wallace, Ryan C Lynch, Avyakta Kallam, Matthew G Mei, Reid W Merryman, Michelle Fleyshman, Joanna M Rhodes, Adam Kidwell, Timothy S Fenske, Nikita Malakhov, Erin Mulvey, Marcus P Watkins, Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa, Talal Hilal, Grzegorz S Nowakowski, Yucai Wang, Pallawi Torka, David A Russler-Germain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41143601/,"This medical research study looked at how the type of large B-cell lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) affects how well patients respond to a new drug called polatuzumab vedotin.

They found that patients with the non-germinal center B-cell subtype had a much better response to polatuzumab compared to those with the germinal center B-cell subtype when the drug was used to treat relapsed/refractory disease. However, this difference was not seen when polatuzumab was used as an initial treatment. These results suggest that knowing the",Oncology,

The primary objective of this single-arm, open-label phase 2 trial was to determine whether denosumab, a RANKL mAb, improved disease control in recurrent osteosarcoma relative to benchmarks derived from historic Children's Oncology Group clinical trial data.Skeletally mature patients ages 11 to 49 years old with measurable disease were eligible for cohort 1, and those with complete surgical resection of all sites of disease were eligible for cohort 2. Patients received denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The primary endpoints were RECIST response and remaining event-free for 4 months for cohort 1 and remaining event-free for 12 months for cohort 2. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were additional endpoints.Fifteen patients in cohort 1 and 38 in cohort 2 were eligible and evaluable for the primary endpoint. One of 15 cohort 1 patients remained event-free at 4 months. There were no objective responses. Ten of 38 cohort 2 patients were event-free at 12 months. The predefined efficacy criteria were not met in either cohort. The most common ≥ grade 3 adverse events were hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia (8% and 11%, respectively). At steady state, mean serum denosumab trough concentrations were 23.7 to 31 μg/mL in cycles 2 to 7. Serum c-telopeptide and urine n-telopeptide decreased on treatment.Denosumab was well-tolerated with anticipated side effects and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters but had insufficient activity for further development in osteosarcoma.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Katherine A Janeway|Alexander J Chou|Allen Buxton|Joel Reid|Michael S Isakoff|Lisa Kopp|Pooja Hingorani|Jill L Lee|John Doski|Heike Daldrup-Link|Laura Hall|R L Randall|Damon R Reed|Steven G Dubois|Mark Krailo|Holcombe Grier|Richard Gorlick,Joel Reid,"Dana-Farber-Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Weill Cornell Medicine - Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, New York, New York.|Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California.|Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut.|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.|AbbVie Inc., San Francisco, California.|Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.|UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.|Department of Radiology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Pediatrics (Pediatric Oncology), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Pediatric Pharmacy, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee.|Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Davis, Davis, California.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.|Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.|Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.","Katherine A Janeway, Alexander J Chou, Allen Buxton, Joel Reid, Michael S Isakoff, Lisa Kopp, Pooja Hingorani, Jill L Lee, John Doski, Heike Daldrup-Link, Laura Hall, R L Randall, Damon R Reed, Steven G Dubois, Mark Krailo, Holcombe Grier, Richard Gorlick",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41159913/,"Osteosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of bone cancer that primarily affects children and young adults.

Clinicopathologic criteria for adjuvant treatment remain imprecise and have not changed for decades. We investigated whether ctDNA in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (""lymph"") 24 hours after surgery identified molecular residual disease (MRD) and compared its performance with time-matched plasma.Using an ultra-sensitive tumor-informed sequencing approach, tumor variants were called in lymph and plasma to classify patients as ctDNA positive or ctDNA negative, trained in an initial cohort of 36 patients, and replicated in an independent cohort of 37 patients. Progression-free survival was compared in ctDNA(+) versus ctDNA(-) patients.Lymph identified MRD in two independent multi-site cohorts (initial cohort sensitivity = 76% and specificity = 63%; log-rank P = 0.01; replication cohort sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 70%; log-rank P = 0.04). Lymph performance was enhanced in locoregional relapse (sensitivity = 78% and specificity = 67%; log-rank P = 0.0004) and generalized to early-stage patients. Analysis of matched plasma collected at this early timepoint was not predictive of recurrence (sensitivity = 35% and specificity = 72%; log-rank P = 0.7). In patients with intermediate-risk pathology, lymph ctDNA was associated with recurrence (sensitivity = 88% and specificity = 67%; log-rank P = 0.0008), suggesting an opportunity for improved stratification of patients who may benefit from additional adjuvant treatment.Postoperative lymph is a novel, proximal, and early source of MRD with the potential to introduce more precision into adjuvant therapy decision-making and improve outcomes, especially for patients with intermediate-risk human papillomavirus-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Seka Lazare|Zhuosheng Gu|Noah Earland|Michael A Harmon|Maciej Pacula|Megan Rivera|Ashley Tellis|Damion Whitfield|Adam Benson|Sophie Gerndt|Peter Harris|Lucien Khalil|Ricardo Ramirez|Zhongping Xu|Benjamin Wahle|Sid Puram|Doug Adkins|Wade Thorstad|Daniel Zandberg|Rebecca Chernock|Heath Skinner|Matthew E Spector|Raja Seethala|Robert L Ferris|Joshua D Smith|Amy E Greer|Ellen L Verner|Andrew Georgiadis|Mark Sausen|Shakti H Ramkissoon|Taylor J Jensen|Marra S Francis|Wendy Winckler|Aadel A Chaudhuri|Jose P Zevallos,Aadel A Chaudhuri,"Droplet Biosciences, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.|Labcorp, Baltimore, Maryland.|Labcorp, Durham, North Carolina.|Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.|Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Seka Lazare, Zhuosheng Gu, Noah Earland, Michael A Harmon, Maciej Pacula, Megan Rivera, Ashley Tellis, Damion Whitfield, Adam Benson, Sophie Gerndt, Peter Harris, Lucien Khalil, Ricardo Ramirez, Zhongping Xu, Benjamin Wahle, Sid Puram, Doug Adkins, Wade Thorstad, Daniel Zandberg, Rebecca Chernock, Heath Skinner, Matthew E Spector, Raja Seethala, Robert L Ferris, Joshua D Smith, Amy E Greer, Ellen L Verner, Andrew Georgiadis, Mark Sausen, Shakti H Ramkissoon, Taylor J Jensen, Marra S Francis, Wendy Winckler, Aadel A Chaudhuri, Jose P Zevallos",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182409/,"This medical research study focused on a common and serious problem in head and neck cancer - the recurrence of the disease after initial treatment.

They compared this approach to analyzing blood samples taken at the same time. 

The researchers found that analyzing the lymph fluid was much better at identifying patients who were at higher risk of their cancer returning, compared to the blood samples. This was true across two separate groups of patients, and was especially helpful for detecting cancer recurrence in the same area as the original tumor. Importantly, the lymph fluid analysis was able to identify high-risk patients even when standard clinical factors suggested an intermediate risk.

41213103,2026-01-07,A Phase II Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Doses of a Folate Receptor Alpha Vaccine in Patients with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"CD4 T-cell immunity is associated with improved survival in patients with breast cancer. We previously reported a phase I trial evaluating a folate receptor alpha (FRα) vaccine administered with cyclophosphamide (CP), demonstrating excellent safety and immunogenicity. To simplify the vaccine strategy for ease of use, we report here the results of a randomized phase II trial evaluating a lower vaccine dose alongside the original dose, administered with or without CP pretreatment.Patients with triple-negative breast cancer who completed all systemic and local therapies were assigned to receive either low-dose (825 μg) or high-dose (2.5 mg) vaccine peptides plus GM-CSF in six 4-week cycles, with or without CP prior to vaccination. Safety was monitored, and immunogenicity was evaluated before and after vaccination.A total of 80 patients were dosed with vaccine, and 58 patients were evaluable for immunogenicity. Vaccination was well tolerated and elicited immunity in 83% of patients. Levels of FRα-specific T cells were high, persistent, and comparable with T-cell levels against tetanus toxoid. No differences in immunity were observed between the two doses. CP pretreatment also did not affect the immune responses. Recurrences occurred in eight evaluable patients and were unrelated to the treatment arm. No patients died during the study because of their disease.The reduced-dose FRα vaccine is as effective as the original dose and does not require CP to generate maximal immunity.

This study aimed to characterize the underlying aetiology, and outcomes of invasively treated young patients with TBAD, with a focus on the impact of heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD).A retrospective multicentre analysis was conducted across 19 international aortic centres, including 139 patients aged ≤30 years with TBAD. Patients with chronic TBAD (n = 42) were excluded for the final analysis. The cohort was classified as uncomplicated (n = 86) or complicated (n = 53) TBAD. Clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected using standardized forms. Outcomes were compared between subgroups defined by TBAD complexity, HTAD status, and surgical strategy. Kaplan-Meier and Andersen-Gill analyses were used for survival and recurrent aortic intervention, respectively.Mean follow-up time was 6.5 years. HTAD was identified in 57% of patients. Most presented with uncomplicated TBAD (62%), while high-risk uncomplicated cases were uncommon. Endovascular repair was predominant in complicated TBAD, while open repair was more frequent in uncomplicated cases. Early mortality was low (n = 3), and mid-term survival was excellent across all subgroups. HTAD was a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions (HR = 3.3, P = .004). No significant differences were observed in survival or reintervention rates between uncomplicated and complicated TBAD or between operative strategies.In young patients, TBAD predominantly occurs in the context of HTAD. Both open and endovascular repair are associated with excellent early outcomes and mid-term survival. However, HTAD remains a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions.© The Author(s) 2025.

Associations of demographics, body mass index (BMI), clinical, and biochemical hypercortisolism severity, subtype of hypercortisolism, pre-surgical hypercortisolism duration, glucocorticoid type, and nadir cortisol in relation to duration of AI were investigated.The 242 patients [41% MACS, 46% pituitary CS, 12% adrenal CS, 1% ectopic CS, median age 50 years (IQR: 40-60), 85% women] who developed postsurgical AI were followed for a median duration of 13.7 months (IQR 7.2-26.3). The median time to recovery of AI was shorter in MACS vs. overt CS (3.9 months (95% CI: 3.3-6.2) vs. 13.5 months (95% CI 11.3-18.3), P value < .001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and glucocorticoid type, moderate to severe biochemical severity score (β = 11, P value < .001) and moderate to severe clinical severity score (β=8.7, P < .001), were associated with a longer duration of AI.Baseline clinical and biochemical hypercortisolism severity scores may inform individualized counseling on post-operative AI duration in patients treated for CS and MACS.© The Author(s) 2025.

The researchers compared the responses of three different language models, evaluating factors like the accuracy and appropriateness of the content, the quality of the citations used, and the readability of the text. They found that one model, called OpenEvidence, performed the best, providing summaries that were more accurate and cited higher-quality research studies compared to the other models. Interestingly, when the researchers showed the best chatbot-generated summary to experienced colorectal surgeons, the doctors had difficulty distinguishing it from the actual expert consensus document.

The optimal access route-transgastric (TG) versus transduodenal (TD)-remains uncertain. We compared outcomes of TG versus TD EUS-GBD at a high-volume tertiary center.We included patients who underwent EUS-GBD between January 2020 and December 2024. Baseline demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes data were collected. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as resolution of cholecystitis or relief of biliary obstruction. Secondary outcomes included stent misdeployment, adverse events (AEs), and need for endoscopic reintervention. Comparisons were performed using the unpaired T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact test, with significance at p < 0.05.We included 82 patients (mean age 72 years, 48% female). The indication for drainage was cholecystitis for 45 (55%) patients and MDBO with a patent cystic duct and prior failed ERCP for 37 (45%) patients. Sixty-four (78%) patients underwent transduodenal (TD) EUS-GBD and 18 (22%) underwent transgastric (TG) EUS-GBD. There was no difference between the two groups for clinical success (TD 89% vs. TG 94%, p = 0.68) overall nor when evaluated by procedural indication. There were five (8%) cases of stent misdeployment in the TD EUS-GBD group and zero cases in the TG EUS-GBD group (p = 0.58), all of which were salvaged endoscopically. There were no significant differences between groups for AEs (20% vs. 17%, p =  > 0.99) or unplanned endoscopic reintervention (16% vs. 11%, p =  > 0.99).Both TG and TD EUS-GBD are effective and relatively safe, supporting an individualized approach based on technical feasibility and future surgical candidacy. A potential trend toward more misdeployments in the TD EUS-GBD group warrants further study.© 2025.

The researchers analyzed data on over 1 million surgical procedures to see if there were any links between extreme weather and complications like infections, organ failure, or death. They found that certain types of extreme weather, like prolonged heatwaves, were associated with a small but statistically significant increase in negative outcomes for patients. This suggests that extreme weather may indeed have an impact on postoperative health, though the exact mechanisms are still unclear. The findings highlight the need for hospitals to have emergency plans in place to maintain high-quality care during extreme weather events.

41493809,2026-01-07,Senolytic Changes in Murine Arteriovenous Fistulas with CKD.,"Hemodialysis therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requires suitable vascular access, most commonly the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Forty percent of AVFs fail within one year, leading to morbidity and care costs. Failure mechanisms remain unclear and current therapies are inadequate. Cellular senescence may be critical in AVF failure, and ESKD itself may accelerate senescence and subsequent vascular dysfunction. Senescence follows AVF placement in rodents with normal kidney function, but the temporal and spatial features in uremic conditions are unknown. This study aimed to characterize AVF changes in uremic mice over time and versus control vessels.Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL6/J mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy. Twenty-eight days later an AVF was created by cuff anastomosis (right carotid artery to the right jugular vein). Transcriptomic analysis was performed seven days post-AVF, and further samples were collected at fourteen and twenty-eight days post-AVF creation for histological assessment.AVF outflow vein morphometry showed reduced neointimal cell density. Whole transcriptomic analysis of outflow vs control veins at seven days post-AVF placement revealed 1187 upregulated and 3256 downregulated genes. Differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in two established senescence related gene sets, SenMayo (a curated panel of ∼125 genes validated across species to capture senescence and associated proteins) and SenSig (a broader panel assessed to represent fibrotic and stress induced cell response). Histologically, senescence markers p16, p21, and phospho53 increased between day 14 and 28. Genes common to our dataset, SenMayo, and SenSig were validated with qPCR.These data support established markers of AVF failure like matrix-metalloproteinases and monocyte chemokines and identify potential novel modulators of AVF survival that may inform senolytic strategies to improve patency. In summary, this study reveals for the first time the chronological progression of vascular senescence in the AVF of uremic mice.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

The researchers used mice with kidney disease to study what happens in the blood vessels after a fistula is created. They found that the cells lining the fistula's vein start to show signs of ""senescence"" - a state of aged, dysfunctional cells. This cellular senescence increased over time and was accompanied by changes in gene expression patterns associated with aging and stress.

41494644,2026-01-07,Multi-omics Alterations Associated with Tolerance and Response to Simulated Progressive Hemorrhage in Healthy Adult Humans.,"Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of preventable death among military and civilian trauma patients. While caused by severe hypovolemia, the threshold of blood volume reduction that triggers recruitment of compensatory mechanisms varies markedly. Individuals have been classified as having low (LT) or high (HT) tolerance to hypovolemia; however, molecular features contributing to tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate multi-omics correlates of hypovolemia tolerance and molecular responses underlying physiologic compensating mechanisms of blood loss. Healthy adult human subjects (n=133) recruited from two sites underwent lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to simulate progressive hemorrhage. The primary outcome variable was hemodynamic instability accompanied by onset of decompensated shock defined by systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg. Participants were classified into HT (n=90) and LT (n=43) subjects using a Cumulative Stress Index quantifying maximal LBNP tolerance. Genome-wide mRNA, microRNA, whole-exome sequencing, and select protein abundances were assayed using blood samples collected immediately before and after LBNP procedure. LBNP produced extensive transcriptomic response at post- compared to pre-LBNP, including natural killer cell mediated immunity activation and gas transport processes inhibition. Differentially expressed miRNAs also regulated these enriched processes. Tolerance group specific signals include alpha-beta T cell activation and MHC class II protein complex assembly inhibition in HT group. Integrated analysis of multiple molecular layers demonstrated a role of cytokines and epigenetic regulators in molecular mechanisms of compensating to progressive hemorrhage.

Previously we showed that TNFα induces an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response involving autophosphorylation of inositol requiring enzyme 1α at serine 724 (pIRE1αS724) and alternative splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s). XBP1s transcriptionally activates expression of Cyclin dependent kinases 1 and 5 (CDK1 and CDK5). In the present study, we hypothesized that TNFα induced activation of the pIRE1αS724/XBP1s ER stress pathway mediates transcriptional activation of Cyclin B1 and ASM cell proliferation. Human ASM (hASM) cells were dissociated from bronchiolar tissue samples obtained from female and male patients with no history of respiratory disease. Isolated hASM cells were either treated or untreated with TNFα (20 ng/ mL) for 6 h. For loss of function experiments, hASM cells were either treated with 4μ8C, a pharmacological inhibitor of IRE1α endoribonuclease activity or transfected with a non-spliceable XBP1 mutant (δXBP1). The binding site sequences of XBP1s to the CCNB1 (Cyclin B1 gene) promoter was identified by bioinformatic analysis and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. hASM cell proliferation was measured using a CyQuant cell proliferation assay. TNFα induced pIRE1αS724 phosphorylation and XBP1s splicing in hASM cells. XBP1 transcriptionally activates expression of Cyclin B1 mRNA and protein. Nuclear localization of Cyclin B1 increased significantly in TNFα treated hASM cells consistent with the formation of Cyclin B1/CDKs complexes, and increased cell proliferation. Inhibition of pIRE1αS724/XBP1s pathway mitigated TNFα induced Cyclin B1 and CDKs expression and hASM cell proliferation.",American journal of physiology.

41499724,2026-01-08,OCT-Based Differentiation of First Acute Optic Neuritis: An International Study of 111 Patients With NMOSD and MOGAD.,"Severe optic neuritis (ON) is a common clinical manifestation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Given distinct prognoses and often the necessity of early plasma exchange in NMOSD, prompt differentiation is crucial. In this study, we investigated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in differentiating between first acute NMOSD-ON and MOGAD-associated optic neuritis (MOGAD-ON), as well as specific factors associated with disc edema.In this retrospective multicenter study, 111 adult patients with MOGAD or aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD who experienced a first ON and underwent OCT within 2 weeks of symptom onset were included from 14 centers across 8 countries. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in µm was analyzed, including the average of both eyes in cases of bilateral manifestation.Eighty-three patients with MOGAD (51 women; 124 ON eyes; bilateral ON 48.2%) and 28 with NMOSD (24 women; 36 ON eyes; bilateral ON 21.4%) were enrolled. A significant increase in pRNFL thickness (>2SD), suggestive of disc edema, was observed in 73.4% of MOGAD-ON eyes and 11.1% of NMOSD-ON eyes (p < 0.001). The pRNFL thickness cutoff of 117.5 µm provided 92.9% specificity and 71.1% sensitivity in distinguishing between MOGAD-ON and NMOSD-ON (area under the curve = 0.838). There was no association between pRNFL thickening and MOG-IgG titer (high vs low), body mass index, or the delay between ON onset and OCT. Simultaneous bilateral MOGAD-ON was associated with significantly more pronounced pRNFL thickening.Acute-stage OCT contributes to the rapid and accurate differentiation between MOGAD-ON and NMOSD-ON prior to antibody confirmation, which can be critical for timely therapeutic decisions.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,"Mar, 2026",2026.0,Mar,,Thivya Pakeerathan|James Davis|Amanda D Henderson|Elias S Sotirchos|Yana Said|Joachim Havla|Marius Ringelstein|Orhan Aktas|Margit Weise|Jonathan A Gernert|Barbara Kornek|Gabriel Bsteh|Paulus S Rommer|Nik Krajnc|Anne-Katrin K Pröbstel|Athina Papadopoulou|Laila Kulsvehagen|Roxanne Pretzsch|Kean Schoenholzer|Tanyatuth Padungkiatsagul|Heather E Moss|Sylvia E Villarreal Navarro|Marina Herwerth|Madalina Graure|Veronika Kana|Hadas Stiebel-Kalish|Rita Zlatkin|Anthony C Arnold|Laura Bonelli|Jan-Patrick P Stellmann|Natacha Stolowy|Carolin Schwake|Christiane Schneider-Gold|Tania Kümpfel|Philipp Albrecht|Natthapon Rattanathamsakul|Sean J Pittock|Eoin P Flanagan|Sara Carta|Sara Mariotto|Ralf Gold|John J Chen|Ilya Ayzenberg,Natthapon Rattanathamsakul|Sean J Pittock|Eoin P Flanagan|John J Chen,"Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.|Division of Neuro-Ophthalmology, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Department of Neurology, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, LMU University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Center for Neurology and Neuropsychiatry, LVR-Klinikum, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.|Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences and Mental Health, Austria.|Departments of Biomedicine and of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Research Center of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel (RC2NB), University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Center of Neurology, Department of Neuroimmunology, University Hospital and University Bonn, Germany.|German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.|Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Translational Imaging in Neurology (ThINk) Basel, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, CA.|Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.|Neuro-ophthalmology Division Department of Ophthalmology, Rabin Medical Center and, Laboratory of Eye Research, Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel.|Department of Ophthalmology, UCLA Stein Eye Institute, Los Angeles, CA.|APHM, Hopital de la Timone, CEMEREM, Marseille, France.|Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CRMBM, Marseille, France.|Department of Ophthalmology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de La Timone, Marseille, France.|Department of Neurology, Kliniken Maria Hilf Mönchengladbach, Germany.|Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Thailand.|Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Italy.","Thivya Pakeerathan, James Davis, Amanda D Henderson, Elias S Sotirchos, Yana Said, Joachim Havla, Marius Ringelstein, Orhan Aktas, Margit Weise, Jonathan A Gernert, Barbara Kornek, Gabriel Bsteh, Paulus S Rommer, Nik Krajnc, Anne-Katrin K Pröbstel, Athina Papadopoulou, Laila Kulsvehagen, Roxanne Pretzsch, Kean Schoenholzer, Tanyatuth Padungkiatsagul, Heather E Moss, Sylvia E Villarreal Navarro, Marina Herwerth, Madalina Graure, Veronika Kana, Hadas Stiebel-Kalish, Rita Zlatkin, Anthony C Arnold, Laura Bonelli, Jan-Patrick P Stellmann, Natacha Stolowy, Carolin Schwake, Christiane Schneider-Gold, Tania Kümpfel, Philipp Albrecht, Natthapon Rattanathamsakul, Sean J Pittock, Eoin P Flanagan, Sara Carta, Sara Mariotto, Ralf Gold, John J Chen, Ilya Ayzenberg",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41499724/,"This research study aimed to help doctors quickly distinguish between two serious eye conditions - optic neuritis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD) and optic neuritis associated with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

We evaluated the real-world effectiveness of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D after myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke and examined trends and disparities.Using nationwide Czech registry data (2015-2024), we identified patients with incident nonfatal MI or ischemic stroke and confirmed T2D. GLP-1RA users-initiating therapy within 12 months post-event-were propensity score-matched to non-users. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death); secondary outcomes included individual components and all-cause mortality.GLP-1RA therapy was initiated in only ∼2% of MI and stroke survivors with T2D. Among 126,845 MI survivors, 28,206 had T2D; the matched cohort comprised 2,271 patients (401 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 35 months). GLP-1RA use was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.7; 95%CI:0.52-0.93), all-cause (HR:0.61;95%CI:0.47-0.80) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.54, 95%CI:0.36-0.80). Among 177,115 stroke survivors, 73,750 had T2D; the matched cohort comprised 2,235 patients (385 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 27 months). GLP-1RA use was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.71; 95%CI:0.54-0.94), all-cause (HR:0.59;95%CI:0.46-0.76) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.55; 95%CI:0.37-0.81).GLP-1RA therapy after MI or stroke in T2D was associated with substantially lower risks of MACE, cardiovascular and all-cause death in real-world practice. Utilization remained low, particularly among women and older adults, underscoring the need for broader and more equitable implementation in secondary prevention.© The Author(s) 2026.

40884219,2026-01-08,AAV9-mediated KCNH2 suppression-replacement gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of type 1 short QT syndrome.,"Type 1 short QT syndrome (SQT1) is a genetic channelopathy caused by gain-of-function variants in KCNH2, resulting in shortened cardiac repolarization and QT intervals, which predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of KCNH2-specific suppression-and-replacement (KCNH2-SupRep) gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of SQT1.KCNH2-SupRep was developed by combining a KCNH2-shRNA with its corresponding shRNA-immune KCNH2-cDNA into an AAV9 vector, delivered directly into the aortic root (1 × 1010 vg/kg). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo by electrocardiogram, ex vivo by optical mapping, and at cellular levels by patch-clamp, calcium imaging, and qPCR in ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs).In vivo, KCNH2-SupRep normalized the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) in SQT1 rabbits, without affecting repolarization heterogeneity. Ex vivo, KCNH2-SupRep corrected the action potential duration (APD90) and resolved the increased apicobasal APD90 heterogeneity observed in untreated (UT)-SQT1 hearts, supporting an antiarrhythmic effect, which was further validated by reduced re-entry formation in silico. At cellular levels, KCNH2-SupRep prolonged APD90 in VCMs from SupRep-SQT1 rabbits closer to wildtype levels compared with UT- and sham-SQT1. Additionally, KCNH2-SupRep restored the cellular surrogate of the electro-mechanical window and normalized IKr in nearly 50% of VCMs, in line with a 50%-60% suppression of the mutant KCNH2 transcript.This proof-of-concept study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of gene therapy for SQT1 in a medium-sized animal model.

41498509,2026-01-08,Elevated Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Concentrations Poorly Predict VIPoma.,"VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that is challenging to diagnose. While VIP concentrations are elevated in VIPoma, the optimal threshold for diagnostic purposes is not well defined. We aimed to study this in a single institution population. We obtained results from vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) tests from 2011-2023 and reviewed the medical record for patients who had concentrations greater than our established assay-specific reference limit of 75 pg/mL. We compared plasma VIP concentrations between patient cohorts with and without VIPoma and determined the optimal threshold for VIP concentrations to predict a VIPoma in this population.76 patients met the selection criteria. Of these, nine cases of VIPoma were diagnosed. All patients had chronic diarrhea, and five patients had a previous diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). VIP concentrations drawn for acute/episodic diarrhea or flushing/diaphoresis did not lead to a diagnosis of a VIPoma. Mean VIP concentration was increased in patients with a VIPoma relative to those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (508 pg/mL vs 223 pg/mL, p=0.31). Using the threshold of 75 pg/mL, the positive predictive value for a VIPoma was 12%. The optimal VIP threshold was 442 pg/mL (OR: 11.96, 95% CI: 2.00-79.69, p=0.01) with statistically significant odds ratios starting at 200 pg/mL.

41498520,2026-01-08,Cuff conundrum: inflatable penile prosthesis surgery in men who have transcorporal artificial urinary sphincters.,"Concerns exist regarding inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) placement after transcorporal artificial urinary sphincter (TC-AUS) surgery due to potential risk of damaging the AUS cuff during corporal dilation and device placement.To evaluate perioperative complications, infections, revision rates, and device longevity in patients undergoing IPP placement following prior TC-AUS surgery.We present a case series of men who underwent IPP surgery with an existing TC-AUS in place. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent TC-AUS placement at a single tertiary institution between 2015 and 2025. Patients who subsequently received IPP surgery were identified. Standard IPP techniques were used with additional precautions to protect the AUS, including use of electrocautery instead of sharp dissection and contralateral reservoir placement. Demographics, operative details, complications, infections, revision events, and device survival were collected through review of operative notes and patient records.Primary outcomes included intra-operative difficulties, perioperative complications, infection and erosion rates, and revision or failure rates for both the TC-AUS and IPP devices.Among 757 TC-AUS placements, 17 patients subsequently underwent IPP surgery. Seven patients (41%) had a history of pelvic irradiation. The median operative time for IPP placement was 83 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 68-87), and median follow-up was 31.5 months (IQR 11.2-40.6). All reservoirs were positioned contralateral to the AUS reservoir. A 12 Fr catheter was left postoperatively in 10 patients (59%) for <24 hours. Proximal corporal dilation was noted to be challenging in 3 patients (18%) but dilation was completed without cuff injury or corporal perforation. One patient (6%) had TC-AUS cuff erosion 9.5 months after IPP surgery; one patient (6%) experienced TC-AUS device infection 11.5 months after IPP surgery when his AUD pump eroded through the scrotum. Four patients (24%) developed AUS mechanical failure due to cuff leak at a median of 31.9 months after IPP placement (39.9 months post-AUS).IPP implantation following TC-AUS can be performed safely using careful surgical technique, though vigilance for later AUS mechanical failure is warranted.This study represents one of the largest single-institution series evaluating IPP after TC-AUS and includes detailed operative and follow-up data. However, its retrospective design, small cohort size, and limited follow-up duration restrict generalizability.IPP placement after TC-AUS appears safe, with low infection and erosion rates, though AUS cuff leaks may occur more frequently than when either device is implanted alone.© The Author(s) 2026.

41498526,2026-01-08,Functional and transcriptional senescence profiles of CD8+ T cells associate with the presence of carotid plaques in people living with HIV.,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the immunological mechanisms driving plaque formation remain unclear. This study investigated the association between peripheral immune cell subsets and carotid atherosclerotic plaques in PLHIV without prior clinical ASCVD.In this multi-center cross-sectional study, virally suppressed PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy were enrolled from two Dutch cohorts: a discovery cohort (n= 994) and a validation cohort (n= 200). Between November 2019 and October 2021, participants underwent carotid ultrasound imaging to assess plaques using standardized criteria. Immune profiling was performed using high-dimensional flow cytometry of 355 immune cell populations. Associations with plaque were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for relevant confounders, and key findings were validated in the second cohort. Transcriptomic profiles of main cell populations were evaluated using deconvoluted bulk RNA sequencing to identify differential expression and pathway enrichment.Carotid plaques were present in 584 participants (49%) - 502 of 994 (51%) in the discovery and 82 of 200 (41%) in the validation cohort. Plaques were associated with higher counts of several CD8+ T cell subsets, particularly PD-1-expressing cytotoxic T cells with an interferon secretion profile (CD8TC1PD1+). Transcriptomic analysis of CD8+ T cells revealed downregulated mitochondrial function and upregulated type 1 interferon and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, indicating a senescent phenotype.CD8+ T cell senescence may contribute to early atherosclerotic plaque formation in PLHIV.

41498716,2026-01-08,Emerging Diagnostic Indications for Endoscopic Ultrasound.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a diagnostic imaging tool into a versatile platform that enables high-precision access, sampling, and therapy across gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases. This review summarizes recent advances that are reshaping diagnostic practice and theragnostics. In chronic pancreatitis, EUS remains central when cross-sectional imaging is equivocal; secretin-stimulated endoscopic pancreatic function testing can complement morphology, although discordant results limit standalone certainty. For pancreatic cancer, secretin-stimulated duodenal pancreatic-juice collection enables ""liquid biopsy"" analyses-including methylated DNA markers and extracellular-vesicle microRNAs-that augment carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and may enhance early detection and cyst surveillance. In endohepatology, EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement and liver biopsy offer accurate, same-session assessment with strong safety profiles. Adjunctive imaging-contrast-enhanced EUS and elastography-improves lesion characterization and targeting. Tissue acquisition has shifted toward end-cutting fine-needle biopsy needles, optimized by fanning/torque techniques, wet-suction, and macroscopic/visual on-site evaluation, reducing passes while preserving molecular adequacy. Artificial intelligence is emerging across workflows-from differentiating pancreatic lesions and staging to automating standardized photodocumentation and reporting-and is being explored for needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy image interpretation. For pancreatic cysts, glucose, selected genomics (eg, KRAS/GNAS and targeted panels), and through-the-needle biopsy refine diagnosis. Finally, EUS-obtained tissue now seeds organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and organotypic slice cultures to test individualized therapies. Collectively, these innovations move EUS beyond ""see and biopsy"" toward detect, predict, and personalize.Copyright © 2025 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For pancreatitis, EUS can provide important information when other imaging tests are unclear. EUS can also collect pancreatic fluid samples, which can be analyzed for biomarkers that may help detect pancreatic cancer earlier. In liver disease, EUS can measure pressure in blood vessels and obtain liver tissue samples, providing valuable data in a single procedure. The researchers also highlight how new technologies like artificial intelligence, specialized biopsy needles, and 3D tissue cultures are enhancing EUS's capabilities to characterize lesions, guide treatment",Gastroenterology,Radiology

This research paper examines a rare type of skin cancer called mycosis fungoides, which is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The researchers looked at cases where this cancer undergoes a transformation, becoming more aggressive with larger cancer cells that express a protein called CD30. Understanding this aggressive subtype of mycosis fungoides is important, as it can be challenging to diagnose and treat effectively. 

The researchers reviewed medical records to identify patients with mycosis fungoides who had this large-cell transformation and CD30 positivity. They analyzed the clinical features, treatment approaches, and outcomes for these patients. The key finding was that this aggressive subtype was associated with a poorer prognosis compared to typical mycosis fungoides, with many patients requiring intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. However, some patients did respond well to targeted therapies that block the CD30 protein.

Rectal NSAIDs are guideline-recommended for PEP prophylaxis, yet direct evidence comparing different NSAIDs remains scarce. This study systematically evaluates head-to-head evidence to compare the efficacy of rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin in the prevention of PEP.This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251107055). Eligible studies directly compared rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for PEP prevention in adults undergoing ERCP. A comprehensive search of five databases was performed through July 2025. Pooled risk ratios with 95% CIs were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models based on heterogeneity, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Four studies (three RCTs, one observational; n = 2,917) compared rectal diclofenac (n = 1,275) and indomethacin (n = 1,642) for PEP prevention. Baseline characteristics were comparable, except for less frequent balloon dilatation with diclofenac (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89; p < 0.001). No significant differences were found for overall PEP (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92-1.49; I2 = 0%), mild PEP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94-1.63; I2 = 0%), moderate PEP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.21-1.73; I2 = 0%), severe PEP (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.32-3.77; I2 = 1%), or moderate-to-severe PEP (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46-2.05; I2 = 0%). Secondary outcomes, including mortality and complications, were also similar, with low heterogeneity, indicating equivalent efficacy and safety.Diclofenac and indomethacin demonstrate equivalent efficacy and safety, allowing cost and availability to inform the choice of PEP prophylaxis.© 2026.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded the Alliance reference set study to assess MCDs for use in future trials.Individuals with cancer and controls were recruited; blood specimens were collected prior to cancer treatment. A performance evaluation study was designed utilizing reference set samples. Companies (n = 6) were selected to participate based on review of performance data and ability to utilize the blood collection tube. Companies received samples from cancer types their assay was designed to detect (""targeted""), plus additional ""non-targeted"" and control samples. Companies reported positive/negative calls, risk scores, and tissue-of-origin (TOO) predictions. Sensitivity was computed for early (I-II) and late (III-IV) stage cases, based on positive/negative calls (SEPN) and at fixed 98% specificity (SE98). Specificity and TOO accuracy were computed.549 cases (encompassing 13 cancer types) and 413 controls from the reference set were included in the study. Companies assessed samples from median 6 (range 5-9) targeted cancer types and median 8 (range: 7-11) overall cancer types. Median (range) specificity was 92.3% (76.5%-98.5%). Median (range) SEPN was 32% (25%-42%) for early stage 73% (48%-89%) for late stage; while median (range) SE98 was 19% (8%-35%) for early stage and 66% (13%-79%) for late stage. Median sensitivity for non-targeted types was 40% (early stage) and 52% (late stage).

40873195,2026-01-08,Recent-onset atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly diagnosed early, close to its first occurrence due to: (i) increased public awareness with self-screening; (ii) health care initiatives including population screening and opportunistic case finding; and (iii) increased use and surveillance of implantable cardiac devices. At its onset, AF is often low burden, and cardiovascular co-morbidities may be absent or at an early stage. Thus, the management of recent-onset AF has become an issue of growing importance. Professional guidelines have traditionally focused on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, generally recommending a cautious approach to rhythm control, and priority has been given to rate control to alleviate symptoms. In recent guidelines, the importance of managing lifestyle and co-morbidities has increased. The AF-SCREEN collaboration proposes that a vigorous approach to active management of recent-onset AF may be warranted. This includes addressing co-morbidities and promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent the emergence or progression of AF and associated cardiovascular disease, as well as the initiation of active rhythm control ± anticoagulation to prevent AF-related morbidity and mortality, including stroke and heart failure (HF). Intuitively, intervention early after AF onset would be beneficial since lifestyle and co-morbidity management, plus rhythm control and anticoagulation, are important contributors to improved outcomes in patients with established AF, but robust evidence is lacking for recent-onset AF. There is a delicate balance between achieving favourable outcomes such as preventing strokes, HF and AF progression vs the complications and potential adverse effects of interventions. Given the serious long-term consequences, innovative approaches are necessary to determine the value and risks of initiating active therapy very early in the course of AF. More data are needed to guide the best management of recent-onset AF, bearing AF burden in mind. Long-term studies using large national databases linked to electronic medical records and rhythm monitoring devices offer excellent opportunities. Shorter-term studies focusing on reducing AF burden to slow AF progression and studies focusing on outcomes such as HF could be used in both randomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies.© The Author(s) 2025.

Here, we identified two potent, neutralizing single domain antibodies directed against the tetrameric receptor binding (H) protein of CDV. Structural analyses spotlighted two vulnerable sites within the H protein. While the first overlaps with the receptor binding site, the second encompasses amino acid residues of two protomers located at the distal dimeric head interface, which supports distinct mechanisms of neutralization. Upon application of an engineered tetravalent and biparatopic antibody, ferrets were protected at a remarkably low antibody dose (1 mg/kg) administered intra-peritoneally on days 3 and 7 post-exposure of a lethal CDV challenge.

The Importance of Clinical Specificity and Challenges of Diagnostic Evolution in Progressive Speech-Language Disorders.,"This viewpoint addresses the complexity of the nomenclature of progressive speech-language disorders, which often exists at the intersection of descriptive symptoms, clinical syndromes, and underlying neuropathology. Using primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) as an example, we explore how overlapping diagnostic frameworks employed by speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other clinicians and researchers can lead to different diagnostic labels that may evolve throughout disease progression. These discrepancies and changes can complicate patient understanding, clinical care, and affect eligibility for clinical trials. We highlight the importance of diagnostic specificity, flexibility, and multidisciplinary collaboration in improving patient counseling, prognostication, treatment planning, and clinical research alignment, particularly in the context of the growing number of clinical trials and specialized, multidisciplinary clinics.This viewpoint explores how symptom-based, syndrome-based, and pathology-based diagnoses can work together to support patient care and research. Accurate and specific diagnosis of speech-language disorders has important implications for patient understanding of their condition, identity, prognostic accuracy, access to care, clinical trial enrollment, and treatment planning and efficacy. Misdiagnosis or vague labeling can result in inappropriate interventions, delayed support, and skewed research findings. We argue that multidisciplinary collaboration and flexibility in recognizing evolving symptom-based and syndrome-based labels over the disease course-and as the fields learn more-is essential to empower patients with accurate, actionable information.

41499701,2026-01-08,Probable Stricturing in Small Bowel Crohn Disease: In Support of SAR Consensus Recommendations.,"Crohn disease is a chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder affecting nearly one million people in the United States. Despite therapeutic advances, many patients do not achieve durable intestinal healing, and stricture-related complications, including internal penetrating disease, remain frequent. Disease often progresses radiologically from isolated active inflammation (characterized by bowel wall thickening), to associated luminal narrowing (i.e., >50% diameter reduction), to associated upstream dilatation (i.e., overt stricture, with obstruction risk). The intermediate stage of wall thickening with luminal narrowing is associated with distinct biomarker profiles, microbial signatures, gene expression patterns, imaging features, and prognostic outcomes. Accordingly, consensus statements from the Society of Abdominal Radiology Inflammatory Bowel Disease Disease-Focus Panel indicate that patients with bowel wall thickening and fixed luminal narrowing without upstream dilation should be considered to have probable strictures. Yet, current clinical classification systems do not fully incorporate this radiologic entity. For example, the Montreal and Paris classifications have historically classified patients with wall thickening and luminal narrowing as having the inflammatory rather than stricturing phenotype. This Perspective summarizes evidence supporting probable strictures as a distinct biologic and clinical entity that could aid individualized care and argues for integrating probable stricturing into radiology reports, clinical classification schemes, and treatment pathways.",AJR.

Moreover, the typically prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) correlates inconsistently with overall survival (OS), underscoring the importance of examining other surrogates. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24), an established early endpoint, delineates functionally high-risk patients in other indolent lymphomas. This international study evaluated 253 patients receiving frontline fixed-duration bendamustine-rituximab (BR), a common chemoimmunotherapy for WM. At median follow-up of 5.9 years, 5-year PFS and OS were 65% and 87%, respectively; 5-year PFS was similar between MYD88L265P (90%) and MYD88wild-type (WT) subcohorts (64% each, p=0.4). Among 89 patients with known CXCR4 status, the subcohort with CXCR4mutation (28%) had shorter PFS (median, 3.3 versus 8.8 years; HR 2.8, p=0.0036) and OS (HR 2.6, p=0.036) compared to CXCR4WT. POD24 occurred in 11.5% of patients who demonstrated inferior subsequent OS (5-year OS: 71% versus 86%; HR 3.1, p=0.005) and higher mortality (SMR 3.7), unlike the non-POD24 group, whose mortality was comparable to the matched general population (SMR 1.1). In conclusion, BR is effective, irrespective of the MYD88 status, but CXCR4 mutations and POD24 portend worse outcomes. Non-POD24 patients represent a cohort with distinctly favorable outcome.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Jan 07, 2026",2026.0,Jan,7.0,Saurabh Zanwar|Jithma P Abeykoon|Shirley D'Sa|Damien Roos-Weil|Dirk R Larson|Colin L Colby|Eric Durot|Efstathios Kastritis|Encarl Uppal|Oliver Tomkins|Pierre Morel|Patrizia Mondello|Lydia Montes|Jonas Paludo|Sikander Ailawadhi|Shayna Sarosiek|Olabisi Ogunbiyi|Pascalle Cornillet-Lefebvre|S V Rajkumar|Anne Quinquenel|Angela Dispenzieri|Rafael Fonseca|Morie A Gertz|Shaji K Kumar|Meletios A Dimopoulos|Stephen M Ansell|Steven P Treon|Jorge J Castillo|Prashant Kapoor,Saurabh Zanwar|Jithma P Abeykoon|Dirk R Larson|Colin L Colby|Patrizia Mondello|Jonas Paludo|Sikander Ailawadhi|S V Rajkumar|Angela Dispenzieri|Rafael Fonseca|Morie A Gertz|Shaji K Kumar|Stephen M Ansell|Prashant Kapoor,"Mayo Clinic, rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|UCLH Centre for Waldenströms Macroglobulinaemia and Related Conditions, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Pitié-Salpêtrière, paris, France.|Hôpital Robert Debré CHU de Reims, Reims cedex, France.|Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.|University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Tryst, London, United Kingdom.|CHU Amiens Picardie, Amiens, France.|CHU Amiens, Amiens, France.|Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, United States.|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|UCLH Center for Waldenstroms, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.|Hopital Robert debré, Reims, France.|Hopital Robert Debré, CHU Reims, Reims, France.|Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States.|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.","Saurabh Zanwar, Jithma P Abeykoon, Shirley D'Sa, Damien Roos-Weil, Dirk R Larson, Colin L Colby, Eric Durot, Efstathios Kastritis, Encarl Uppal, Oliver Tomkins, Pierre Morel, Patrizia Mondello, Lydia Montes, Jonas Paludo, Sikander Ailawadhi, Shayna Sarosiek, Olabisi Ogunbiyi, Pascalle Cornillet-Lefebvre, S V Rajkumar, Anne Quinquenel, Angela Dispenzieri, Rafael Fonseca, Morie A Gertz, Shaji K Kumar, Meletios A Dimopoulos, Stephen M Ansell, Steven P Treon, Jorge J Castillo, Prashant Kapoor",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41499755/,"This research examines a new way to predict outcomes for patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, a rare type of blood cancer.

Unlike with TP53 mutations, where mechanisms of progression are defined, pathways underlying clonal fitness and transformation in PPM1D mutant cells remain unclear. In collaboration with 5 academic institutions, we analyzed the clinical and molecular landscape of 337 patients with clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) across four genotypes: PPM1Dmt/TP53wt (n= 170 [50%]), PPM1Dmt/TP53mt (n= 25 [7%]), TP53mt/PPM1Dwt (n=17 [5%]), and TP53wt/PPM1Dwt (n= 125 [38%]). All PPM1D variants were truncating, located in exon 6 of the gene, with a median variant allele frequency (VAF) of 6% (0.3-64%). The PPM1Dmt/TP53mt genotype was most frequently encountered in therapy related (t)CH/CCUS (80%, 66.5%, 76.5% and 19%; p= <0.001) and had a shorter time interval to detection from last genotoxic exposure (6.2, 5.9, 11.25, and 24.5 months; p= <0.001), in comparison to PPM1Dmt/TP53wt, TP53mt/PPM1Dwt and TP53wt/PPM1Dwt genotypes, respectively.

We investigated oxidative stress and hypoxia pathways in term placentae from Alaska Native women who did (commercial or iqmik; n=10) or did not (n=18) use ST during pregnancy. Despite substantial maternal exposure to nicotine, placentae of women who used ST had similar mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and markers of hypoxia compared to those who did not use tobacco. Although mRNA levels of angiogenesis markers vegf and vegfr2 were similar between groups, vegfr1 mRNA levels are increased in placentae of women using ST compared to women who did not use tobacco.

Biological age may better capture ageing's impact on MS and might accelerate due to MS itself. Establishing accelerated biological ageing in adults is complicated by normal ageing and comorbidities. Telomere length, a well-recognised biological ageing marker, is shortened in adults with MS and associated with disability. Demonstrating accelerated biological ageing in paediatric-onset MS (POMS) would strengthen the hypothesis that MS drives premature biological ageing. This study aimed to determine if telomere length differs in POMS compared to age-similar healthy controls.We performed a cross-sectional case-control study of whole blood samples and clinical data from The US Network of Pediatric MS Centers. Real-time quantitative PCR measured telomere length, expressed as a telomere to somatic DNA ratio (T/S ratio). T/S ratio was compared between cases and age-similar healthy controls using multivariate regression analysis adjusting for chronological age, sex, race, ethnicity, tobacco exposure, socioeconomic status and body mass index.We analysed 300 POMS cases and 200 controls. The unadjusted mean T/S ratios were 1.66 (SD 0.32) for cases and 1.71 (SD 0.29) for controls (mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.01, p=0.08). After adjusting for key covariables with face validity, POMS participants had a mean 0.086 shorter T/S ratio than controls (95% CI 0.015 to 0.157, p=0.018).POMS participants demonstrated shorter telomeres than age-similar controls in a multivariable model adjusting for sociodemographic variables, suggesting that MS may contribute to accelerated biological ageing.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

A significant issue hindering GBM therapeutic development is intratumor heterogeneity and plasticity. GBM tumors contain neoplastic cells within a fluid spectrum of diverse transcriptional states. Identifying effective therapeutics requires a platform that predicts the differential sensitivity and resistance of these states to various treatments. Here, we develop scFOCAL (Single-Cell Framework for -Omics Connectivity and Analysis via L1000), to quantify the cellular drug sensitivity and resistance landscape. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM tumors, we identify compounds from the LINCS L1000 database with transcriptional response signatures selectively discordant with distinct GBM cell states, and leverage this capability to predict combination synergy. We validate the significance of these findings in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and identify a combination of an OLIG2 inhibitor and Depatux-M for the treatment of GBM. Our studies suggest that scFOCAL identifies cell states that are sensitive and resistant to targeted therapies in GBM using a measure of cell and drug connectivity, which can be applied to identify new synergistic combinations.© 2025.

41499543,2026-01-08,Unbiased inference for echocardiogram urgency prediction using double machine learning.,"The increased utilization of echocardiography in clinical practice has witnessed a substantial rise, underscoring its pivotal role as a diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular conditions. However, due to the relative scarcity of echocardiography tests, challenges persist in efficiently prioritizing patients for echocardiographic assessments. In this study, we develop a model to assess the urgency of appointments by considering both clinical and administrative variables extracted from Electronic Health Record data. We use double machine learning techniques to analyze these variables and improve our predictions of patient urgency. Traditional methods for estimating variable effects have limitations, particularly in our research context, where clinical and administrative variables may influence one another while also directly impacting the outcome (i.e., the urgency of appointments). In this work, we address this issue by developing an urgency stratification model using double machine learning, which disentangles the complex relationships between variables. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms traditional machine learning methods in predicting appointment urgency but also provides robust estimations of variable effects. Specifically, our results underscore the critical roles of administrative variables and cancer-related comorbidity variables in patient prioritization and appointment urgency prediction. By leveraging double machine learning techniques, our method can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of echocardiography utilization in clinical practice. It provides clinicians with actionable insights for patient prioritization, facilitating the timely identification of urgent cases and the optimal allocation of resources. Our work contributes to the advancement of healthcare practices by leveraging sophisticated analytics to improve patient care delivery and streamline clinical workflows in echocardiography laboratories.

Participants obtain their assigned medication through their health insurance and complete semi-annual study assessments.We engaged multiple partners to develop a centralized text message-based program to facilitate adherence and retention in PRECIDENTD and evaluated its performance from April 2024 to April 2025.The PRECIDENTD study team applied best practices in digital health tool design and built the program with technology company MEMOTEXT. Patient partners identified program goals, co-wrote message content, and completed internal testing. We then deployed the program to PRECIDENTD participants and analyzed responses.We assessed response rate to interactive text messages, proportion of messages flagging participants needing additional support, and the adherence problems identified.The text messaging program includes interactive messages querying if participants are taking the study medication, as well as one-way study timeline messages. During the first year, 450 PRECIDENTD participants across 20 sites received texts. Interactive message response rate was 80%, and 25% of responses identified problems (ie, trouble getting fills/refills and experiencing a health concern or side effect), prompting an outreach call.We co-designed a digital tool that engaged participants and helped identify study participants needing assistance obtaining and adhering to study medications. Collaborative development of similar centralized tools may augment the capacity of national studies to answer important comparative effectiveness research questions.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

PCORnet® Studies can also include institutions that do not participate in PCORnet, and for these organizations, the cost of instantiating a PCORnet® CDM can be prohibitive. Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (FHIR) provides an alternative method of obtaining EHR data.To determine whether data obtained through FHIR might be a viable study solution for those sites that do not participate in PCORnet.® This mixed-methods project had 2 objectives: (1) survey sites participating in PCORnet on the availability of FHIR (FHIR survey); (2) compare the coverage of a FHIR-based data extract using REDCap with one from the PCORnet® CDM across 3 sites (FHIR extract).(1) FHIR survey: A series of questions were asked about the use of FHIR in a production capacity.

Our goal for this study was to develop a pancreas-liver co-culture system suited for mechanistic and therapy testing studies in the context of multi-organ cross talk. To achieve this goal, we developed a co-axial flow-focusing microfluidic device to fabricate multi-compartment hydrogel microcapsules. Each microcapsule contained two aqueous compartments or cores surrounded by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. Each microcapsule had pancreatic β-cells loaded into one compartment and hepatic cells into another compartment. Individual encapsulated cells assembled into pancreatic and hepatic cell spheroids over time. Characterization of microcapsules revealed enhanced hepatic and pancreatic function in microcapsules containing pancreas-liver co-cultures compared to microcapsules with one cell type only. Multicompartment microcapsules represent a novel microphysiological system type and hold the promise of increasing experiment throughput for mechanism discovery and drug development studies.© 2026.

41289012,2026-01-09,Daily locomotor activity declines with tumor growth and disease progression in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor that often progresses despite resection and treatment. Timely and continuous assessment of GBM progression is critical to expedite secondary surgery or enrollment in clinical trials. However, current progression detection requires costly and specialized MRI examinations, which, in the absence of new symptoms or signs, are usually scheduled every 2-3 months. Here, we hypothesized that changes in daily activity are associated with GBM growth and disease progression. We found that wheel-running activity in GBM-bearing mice declined as tumors grew and preceded weight loss and circadian breakdown by over a week. Temozolomide treatment in the morning, but not evening, significantly reduced tumor size and restored daily locomotion in mice. In a pilot study of 6 patients with GBM wearing an actigraphy watch, wrist movement provided a feasible and continuous longitudinal indicator of daily activity with 1-minute resolution. After tumor resection and radiation, daily activity declined in 2 patients 19 and 55 days before detection of progression by MRI but did not change for the 4 patients with stable disease. These results suggest that daily activity tracking using wearable devices may serve as a real-time indicator and potential monitoring tool for GBM progression and treatment efficacy.",JCI insight,"Jan 09, 2026",2026.0,Jan,9.0,Maria F Gonzalez-Aponte|Sofia V Salvatore|Anna R Damato|Ruth G Katumba|Grayson R Talcott|Omar H Butt|Jian L Campian|Jingqin Luo|Joshua B Rubin|Olivia J Walch|Erik D Herzog,Jian L Campian,"Department of Biology, Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery.|Siteman Cancer Center Biostatistics and Qualitative Research Shared Resource.|Department of Pediatrics, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and.|Department of Neuroscience, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Arcascope Inc., Arlington, Virginia, USA.|Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.","Maria F Gonzalez-Aponte, Sofia V Salvatore, Anna R Damato, Ruth G Katumba, Grayson R Talcott, Omar H Butt, Jian L Campian, Jingqin Luo, Joshua B Rubin, Olivia J Walch, Erik D Herzog",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41289012/,"Glioblastoma is an aggressive and deadly type of brain cancer that often continues to grow despite treatment.

The initial studies describing this technique used a relatively smooth Br56 kernel. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that the use of the sharpest quantitative kernel on photon-counting CT (Qr89), particularly when denoised with techniques such as quantum iterative reconstruction or convolutional neural networks, enhances the detection of CSF-venous fistulas. In this clinical report, we sought to determine whether the Qr89 kernel has utility in patients with dural tears, the other main type of spinal CSF leak. We performed a retrospective review of patients with dural tears diagnosed on photon-counting CT myelography, comparing Br56, Qr89 denoised with quantum iterative reconstruction, and Qr89 denoised with a trained convolutional neural network. We specifically assessed spatial resolution, noise level, and diagnostic confidence in 8 such cases, finding that the sharper Qr89 kernel outperformed the smoother Br56 kernel. This finding was particularly true when Qr89 was denoised using a convolutional neural network. Furthermore, in 2 cases, the dural tear was only seen on the Qr89 reconstructions and missed on the Br56 kernel. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential value of further optimizing postprocessing techniques for photon-counting CT myelography aimed at localizing dural tears.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

High-quality studies in this population are lacking, with limited data on medications approved to treat IBD during pregnancy. For patients, limited knowledge surrounding pregnancy impacts pregnancy rates, medication adherence, and outcomes. Limited provider knowledge leads to highly varied practices in care affected by local dogma, available resources, individual interpretation of the literature, and fear of harming the fetus. The variations in guidelines by different societies and countries reflect this and lead to confusion for physicians and patients alike. The Global Consensus Consortium is a group of 39 IBD and content experts and 7 patient advocates from 6 continents who convened to review and assess current data and come to an agreement on best practices based on these data.The GRADE process was used when sufficient published data were available and the RAND process in those instances where expert opinion was needed to guide consistent practice. Recommendations were informed by the guiding principle that maternal health best supports infant health.The topics were divided into ten categories with 34 GRADE recommendations and 35 Consensus statements.Overall, the goal of the group was to provide data-driven and practical guidance to improve the care of women with IBD around the globe based on the best available research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

In contrast, carotid involvement and complete occlusions were more frequent in patients with CeADed (p < 0.001 for both). CeADid was associated with a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) toward worse functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-0.92) but the odds for favorable outcomes (mRS = 0-2) did not differ between the groups after appropriate adjustments on multivariate analysis. CeADid was independently associated with higher mortality at 180 days on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.50-5.38).CeADid is associated with more severe clinical presentation, a shift toward less favorable outcomes, and higher mortality rates. These findings suggest that CeADid may represent a high-risk type of CeAD.

41504430,2026-01-09,Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line IV Versus Oral Iron for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding.,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects nearly one-third of women globally, with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) being a significant risk factor among those of reproductive age. Despite the substantial burden of HMB-related IDA, patients often face delays in receiving effective treatment. Oral iron is typically used as first-line therapy, despite frequent gastrointestinal side effects and challenges in treatment adherence. This study evaluated the reproductive lifespan cost-effectiveness of first-line intravenous (IV) versus oral iron therapy for women with HMB and IDA. We developed a Markov model simulating a cohort of women from age 18 to 51, comparing first-line treatment with IV iron dextran, IV ferumoxytol, IV iron sucrose, or oral ferrous sulfate. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from the societal perspective. IV iron dextran was the cost-effective treatment, yielding 19.26 QALYs at a cost of $157,500, compared with 19.10 QALYs at $152,900 for oral ferrous sulfate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for IV iron dextran was $28,600 per QALY. Treatment with IV ferumoxytol and iron sucrose cost $158,300 and $163,500 respectively and did not provide additional QALY benefit compared with IV iron dextran, which remained the cost-effective treatment across a range of scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Our findings indicate that first-line treatment with IV iron dextran is the cost-effective strategy for managing IDA in women with HMB at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. These results support expanding access to IV iron as a first-line option and highlight the need to reduce treatment delays and insurance-related barriers.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Jan 08, 2026",2026.0,Jan,8.0,Daniel Wang|Manraj S Sra|Satoko Ito|Ding Q Ng|Samira Glaeser-Khan|Daniel Y Wang|Sam Hirniak|Alfred I Lee|Adam Cuker|George Goshua,Manraj S Sra,"Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut, United States.|University Of Waterloo, Kitchener, Ontario, Ontario, Canada.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.","Daniel Wang, Manraj S Sra, Satoko Ito, Ding Q Ng, Samira Glaeser-Khan, Daniel Y Wang, Sam Hirniak, Alfred I Lee, Adam Cuker, George Goshua",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41504430/,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common problem, especially for women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

41504793,2026-01-09,Molecular and genetic insights into vestibular schwannoma.,"Vestibular Schwannomas (VS) are benign nerve sheath tumors arising from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve, occurring sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Clinical management of VS is challenging due to the tumor's location adjacent to critical neural and vascular structures. The primary morbidities are hearing loss and facial nerve dysfunction, which significantly affect quality of life. There are no FDA-approved medical therapies, and treatment typically consists of surgery or radiation, with treatment decisions centered on optimizing hearing and facial nerve preservation.This review synthesizes recent advances in the molecular characterization of VS.The loss of NF2 function, leading to Merlin inactivation, is a key driver of VS tumorigenesis, disrupting multiple growth and survival pathways. Beyond NF2 inactivation, emerging genomic studies have revealed additional molecular alterations, including chromatin remodeling defects and oncogenic gene fusions, broadening our understanding of VS heterogeneity. Recent single-cell and multi-omic studies have uncovered distinct tumor subtypes and highlighted the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the interaction between Schwann cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).These findings have important implications for therapeutic development, as they suggest differential treatment strategies based on molecular and immune profiles. While surgery and radiotherapy remain the standard of care, targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and immunotherapies are being investigated to improve patient outcomes.© 2026.

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) previously provided consensus recommendations on the approach to endoscopy in EoE across topics of endoscopic diagnosis, endoscopic grading, and esophageal dilation. Because additional areas of endoscopy still required guidance, we performed an independent modified Delphi process focusing on pediatric considerations, disease assessment, and disease monitoring. A core group of EoE experts reviewed published guidelines and developed a set of patient-centered recommendation statements informed by literature review. A multidisciplinary group of adult and pediatric international EoE experts then voted on the statements over 2 Delphi rounds. All statements with 80% agreement were accepted for inclusion. This process yielded 28 consensus statements. Pediatric-specific statements covered when to suspect EoE and perform endoscopy, how to grade endoscopic severity, and when and how to perform esophageal dilation in children. Statements across all age ranges addressed the role of less-invasive monitoring, performing diagnostic endoscopy off treatment, the need to consider symptoms, endoscopic features, and histologic findings when assessing disease activity, treatment-based monitoring intervals, and the approach to esophageal biopsies during monitoring. Coupled with the original consensus work, we provide a comprehensive endoscopic approach to EoE as well as practical guidance for procedure-related aspects in the field to facilitate high-quality endoscopic care to patients with EoE.Copyright © 2025 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

41505889,2026-01-09,Exploiting harmonic signature of gas vesicles in amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition for ultrafast ultrasound molecular imaging.,"Ultrafast nonlinear ultrasound imaging of gas vesicles (GVs) promises high-sensitivity biomolecular visualization for applications such as targeted molecular imaging and real-time tracking of gene expression. However, separating GV-specific signals from tissue background remains challenging due to tissue clutter and limitations of current methods, which require complex transmit schemes and suffer from incomplete tissue suppression. This study aims to develop and validate harmonic amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (HAM-SVD), a novel technique that represents a shift from current GV imaging methods by exploiting the unique nonlinear pressure-dependence of the GV harmonic signature.&#xD;Approach: HAM-SVD employs single-cycle plane waves transmitted at 9.6 MHz across five tilted angles at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 Hz, under four duty cycles with alternating polarity. Beamformed data are reshaped into a space-pressure Casorati matrix and decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD). Tissue background is suppressed by discarding the first (weakly nonlinear tissue) and lowest (noise) singular modes, yielding images comprised solely of pressure-dependent second-harmonic GV signals. The method was validated through numerical simulations, in vitro phantom experiments, and in vivo rat lower limb imaging.&#xD;Main results: HAM-SVD achieved a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 19.16 ± 1.63 dB in vivo, significantly outperforming pulse inversion (14.19 ± 1.41 dB) and AM-SVD (15.79 ± 1.38 dB). Simulation and phantom studies demonstrated superior spatial coherence in singular vector decomposition and reduced nonlinear artifacts compared to AM-SVD. HAM-SVD enables wide-field, ultrafast imaging without complex transmit sequences while maintaining robust tissue clutter suppression across varying pressure levels.&#xD;Significance: By combining harmonic imaging with AM-SVD's adaptive clutter filtering, HAM-SVD overcomes limitations of conventional nonlinear techniques, including depth restrictions and incomplete tissue cancellation. This approach enhances molecular imaging specificity for GVs and holds translational potential for ultrasound localization microscopy of slow-flowing contrast agents and preclinical disease-targeted molecular imaging.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Physics in medicine and biology,"Jan 08, 2026",2026.0,Jan,8.0,Ge Zhang|Henri Leroy|Nabil Haidour|Nicolas Zucker|Deyver E Rivera|Anatole Jimenez|Thomas Deffieux|Dina Malounda|Rohit Nayak|Sophie Pezet|Mathieu Pernot|Mikhail G Shapiro|Mickael Tanter,Rohit Nayak,"Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, Centre, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, Centre, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, 75231, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, 75231, FRANCE.|Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Pasadena, 91125, UNITED STATES.|Radiology, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905-0002, UNITED STATES.|Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS, INSERM, 1 rue Jussieu, Paris, Paris, 75005, FRANCE.|California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Pasadena, California, 91125-0002, UNITED STATES.|Lab Ondes et Acoustique, Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris, Ville de Paris, Universite Paris VII Denis Diderot ESPCI, 10 rue Vauquelin 75005 Paris, Paris, 75015, FRANCE.","Ge Zhang, Henri Leroy, Nabil Haidour, Nicolas Zucker, Deyver E Rivera, Anatole Jimenez, Thomas Deffieux, Dina Malounda, Rohit Nayak, Sophie Pezet, Mathieu Pernot, Mikhail G Shapiro, Mickael Tanter",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41505889/,"This research explores a new technique called harmonic amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (HAM-SVD) that can improve the imaging of gas-filled structures called gas vesicles (GVs) using ultrasound.

Furthermore, this limited education often contains commonly held myths about facial pain diagnosis. These myths can result in misdiagnoses that lead to ineffective medications, interventions, or surgeries and prolonged pain. Therefore, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Headache and Facial Pain Special Interest Group convened a multidisciplinary group of neurologists, anesthesiologists, and dentists to identify and dispel pervasive myths in facial pain diagnosis.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2026.

41506846,2026-01-09,Multiplanar Reformatted Imaging of the Temporal Bone.,"Multiplanar reformatted imaging is a useful technique in cross-sectional imaging. Multiplanar reformatted imaging allows for the creation of images in planes that are oblique to the original volumetric data. Use of this tool is particularly important in the temporal bone, an anatomically complex structure that is composed of minute osseous landmarks, foramina, clefts, and aqueducts. For example, multiplanar reformatted imaging can be used to assess the integrity and alignment of the ossicles, highlight various pathologic entities, and evaluate the morphology of the inner ear structures.

41507603,2026-01-09,Redox-driven ADAR1 activation promotes Okazaki fragment maturation and DNA replication integrity.,"Okazaki fragment maturation requires efficient removal of RNA primers to form a continuous lagging strand, yet how mismatched primers introduced by error-prone primase are corrected remains unresolved. Here, we show that physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiate a redox-dependent mechanism that drives ADAR1-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing. Oxidation triggers ADAR1 dimerization at replication forks, enhancing RNA editing of mismatched primers-particularly those caused by ATP misincorporation on d(T+C)-rich centromeric DNA. This A-to-I editing step facilitates more efficient RNA primer degradation by RNase H2, thereby ensuring proper Okazaki fragment maturation. Disruption of ADAR1 oxidation results in increased unligated Okazaki fragments, single-stranded gaps and double-strand breaks, most prominently at centromeres. These findings reveal a role for ROS in safeguarding lagging-strand synthesis by coupling ADAR1 oxidation-induced A-to-I RNA editing to replication fork stability.© 2026.

41507664,2026-01-09,A catecholamine-independent pathway controlling adaptive adipocyte lipolysis.,"Several adipose depots, including constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue, resist conventional lipolytic cues. However, under starvation, wasting or cachexia, the body eventually catabolizes stable adipocytes through unknown mechanisms. Here we developed a mouse model of brain-evoked depletion of all fat, including stable constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue, independent of food intake, to study this phenomenon. Genetic, surgical and chemical approaches demonstrated that catabolism of stable adipocytes required adipose triglyceride lipase-dependent lipolysis but was independent of local nerves, the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamines. Instead, concurrent hypoglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia activated a potent catabolic state by suppressing lipid storage and increasing catecholamine-independent lipolysis via downregulation of cell-autonomous lipolytic inhibitors including G0s2. This was also sufficient to delipidate classical adipose depots and was recapitulated in tumour-associated cachexic mice. Overall, this defines unique adaptations of stable adipocytes to resist lipolysis in healthy states while isolating a potent catecholamine-independent neurosystemic pathway by which the body can rapidly catabolize all adipose tissues.© 2026.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on management. This practice advisory aims to fill this critical gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature and providing comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for managing headache patients during hospitalization.In February 2023, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine approved this practice advisory proposal. The steering committee selected committee members based on clinical and research expertise in the field of headache medicine. Nine questions were formulated by the committee, and each question was assigned to a group composed of 3-4 members. A systematic literature search for each question was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science on June 21, 2023. The results from each search were imported into separate Covidence projects for screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Additionally, relevant systematic reviews (SR) were screened. Each group submitted a structured narrative review along with statements and recommendations based on the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) format for grading of evidence. While the USPSTF framework was used, including the language in the recommendations, the formal USPSTF methodology, including the SR with meta-analysis and summary tables with forest plots, was not followed because of low overall evidence quality. The interim draft was shared electronically with each collaborator, who was requested to vote anonymously using two rounds of the modified Delphi approach. A consensus recommendation required >75% agreement.The panel generated 12 statements and 17 recommendations, along with their strength and certainty of evidence. Following two rounds of Delphi voting, a high consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations. Most statements received a low-to-moderate level of certainty, and all but one recommendation received grade B or C, which was consistent with the lack of randomized controlled trials supporting most of the drugs in this document.This evidence-based practice advisory provides a foundational step toward standardizing inpatient headache care and highlights existing gaps in the literature that should be addressed through rigorous prospective randomized studies.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2025.

While clinical guidelines provide treatment recommendations for the most common disease-causing species, they offer limited guidance on managing treatment failures. This study aims to develop a consensus-based decision-making framework for addressing treatment failure in NTM-PD.A panel of 16 international experts used the e-Delphi method to address gaps in NTM-PD management. Initial statements were derived from an open-ended questionnaire, supported by a prior systematic review. Iterative rounds of expert evaluation were conducted until a consensus was reached on treatment failure definitions, decision-making criteria, therapeutic strategies and supportive care measures.Consensus defined treatment failure as the absence of culture conversion after 6 months of appropriate antimycobacterial therapy, while clinical and radiological deterioration were considered additional but non-mandatory criteria. Treatment intensification or de-escalation decisions were based on patient preferences, clinical status, comorbidities, disease severity, antibiotic tolerance, resistance patterns and previous treatment history. Treatment intensification highlighted the necessity for personalised multidrug antibiotic regimens. De-escalation strategies focus on delivering optimal, patient-centred supportive care while minimising pharmacological adverse effects, by opting for simplified antibiotic regimens, intermittent antibiotic courses for symptomatic control or the cessation of antimicrobial therapy.This study offers a structured approach to managing treatment failure in NTM-PD, addressing patient selection, treatment intensification, de-escalation and supportive care, while championing individualised strategies. Future research should concentrate on validating predictive factors for treatment response, refining therapeutic regimens and investigating host-directed therapies to enhance patient outcomes.Copyright ©The authors 2026.

41512208,2026-01-10,Investigating the Frequency and Outcome of Central Vein Sign and Paramagnetic Rim Lesions in Children With MOGAD.,"Central vein sign (CVS) is a common feature in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, but its frequency in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) varies significantly across studies. Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are described in MS, but not in MOGAD. Our goals were to evaluate the prevalence of PRLs and CVS in a large multicenter cohort of pediatric MOGAD. We compared CVS frequencies between acute vs remission phases, as well as with longitudinal dynamics of lesion evolution.In this longitudinal retrospective multicenter study, clinical MRIs were assessed from pediatric patients with MOGAD, who had (1) ≥1 brain lesion, (2) susceptibility-based imaging (SBI), and (3) follow-up MRI at least 3 months apart. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences were analyzed for lesion detection and resolution. SBI was used to assess CVS and PRLs following North American Imaging in MS Cooperative criteria.A total of 65 patients and 130 scans were included. A total of 520 lesions were evaluated. The most common reason for lesion exclusion was size (n = 143, large confluent lesions, n = 122, <3 mm, n = 21). CVS was detected in 97 of 327 (29.7%) lesions, with 32 of 65 (49.2%) patients having at least 1 CVS+ lesion. Patients with ≥1 CVS+ lesion (32/65, 49.2%) had a higher number of lesions (p = 0.002) and lesions suitable for CVS analysis (p < 0.001). Of the 31 patients with ≥3 brain lesions, 11 of 31 (35.5%) had >40% CVS+ lesions and 7 (22.5%) had >50% CVS+ lesions. Only 4 patients had ≥6 CVS+ lesions. The proportion of CVS+ lesions was lower in patients who had SBI acquired during an acute attack vs patients scanned during remission (16% vs 33%, p = 0.015). The rate of lesion resolution was higher in CVS- lesions (177/230, 76%) compared with CVS+ (42/97, 42%, p < 0.001). No PRLs were identified.Lesion pathobiology in MOGAD is heterogeneous. CVS identified persistent rather than transient lesions, with resolution more common among CVS- lesions.

41329901,2026-01-10,FLIPI24: A Modern Prognostic Model and Clinical Trial Enrichment Tool for Newly Diagnosed Follicular Lymphoma.,"Although most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) can expect an indolent course, progressive lymphoma remains the primary cause of death during the first decade after diagnosis. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of starting first-line (1L) immunochemotherapy defines a high-risk population with poor survival, but better risk stratification at diagnosis is needed.The FLIPI24 model was developed and internally validated to predict 24-month event rates using individual data from 4,485 patients treated with 1L immunochemotherapy from 10 observational cohorts of FL. Overall and cause-specific survival was further evaluated in FLIPI24 risk groups. External validation in the 1L immunochemotherapy setting was performed using the prospective observational Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort (N = 565) and three randomized phase III trials (N = 3,192); extension to all patients with FL (any 1L therapy) was performed in the LEO cohort (N = 1,445) and its Molecular Epidemiology Resource subcohort (N = 1,074).The FLIPI24 model uses age and four blood-based variables (hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and WBC count). FLIPI24 showed consistent performance across validation and extension data sets, which was superior to existing prognostic tools. Across the four external immunochemotherapy validation data sets, patients with high-risk FLIPI24 (23%-32% of patients) had significantly higher 24-month event rates (22%-35%) and inferior 5-year overall survival (77%-83%) compared with patients with low-risk FLIPI24 (29%-31% of patients, 24-month event rates: 10%-12%; 5-year OS: 96%-97%). Results were consistent when evaluating lymphoma-related death and when extended to all patients with FL.The FLIPI24 model robustly stratifies, at diagnosis, patients with FL at increased risk of lymphoma-related death versus patients with very low lymphoma-related mortality during the first decade after diagnosis.

41276180,2026-01-10,Microenvironment-targeted strontium delivery system reshapes redox homeostasis to halt degenerative cascades in intervertebral discs.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is mainly caused by oxidative stress, leading to cellular aging and breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Current treatments do not specifically or consistently modify the degenerative environment. To solve this, we developed pH-responsive, strontium-functionalized double-network microspheres (RGD-SA/HA-His-Sr, rSA-HHS) using microfluidic technology. This system combines three key components: RGD-modified alginate for mechanical support and better cell-matrix interaction; histidine-grafted hyaluronic acid for environment-triggered degradation at low pH and reactive oxygen species scavenging; and strontium ions bound through multidentate coordination to control antioxidant responses. The design allows for the controlled release of bioactive ions in acidic disc areas. In vitro tests show sustained ion release over 28 days, reducing cellular aging and inflammation in nucleus pulposus cells while increasing collagen type II and aggrecan production. In vivo rat models of IVDD demonstrate improved disc height and ECM regeneration. The rSA-HHS platform offers a multitarget approach by simultaneously addressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and biomechanical issues. This research highlights important antioxidant mechanisms and presents a new, precise method for disc regeneration that goes beyond single-target biomaterials.Copyright © 2025.

41508901,2026-01-10,Oral rehydration solution for the management of fluid and electrolyte disturbances in patients with an ileostomy: A scoping review.,"Ileostomy creation is common among patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Surgical removal or diversion of the colon can result in nutrition complications, most notably dehydration-a leading cause of hospital readmission-and increased risk of kidney injury. Existing studies on fluid and electrolyte management after ileostomy largely focus on short bowel syndrome or high-output stomas, overlooking the physiological implications of ileostomy creation, even in patients with normal output. Given the absence of standardized oral rehydration protocols and limited interventional data, a scoping review was conducted to map the current evidence on oral rehydration solutions for postoperative fluid and electrolyte management in adults without short bowel syndrome or high-output stoma. Comprehensive searches across five databases identified 5738 articles, of which 6 met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies examined adults with ileostomy for any standard indication in which oral rehydration solution use was a study objective. The included studies were methodologically heterogeneous, encompassing randomized controlled, crossover, double-blinded comparator, retrospective cohort, and qualitative designs. Collectively, available evidence supports a pivotal role for oral rehydration solutions in both short-term and long-term management after ileostomy, improving hydration and reducing complications. This review highlights the need for standardized, evidence-based oral rehydration regimens and underscores opportunities to reduce postoperative morbidity, kidney injury, and hospital readmissions while optimizing long-term outcomes in this growing patient population.© 2026 The Author(s).

In this study, we present a strategy for engineering multifunctional three-dimensional (3D) stem cell spheroids (Sphe-BP-IL4-BMP2) by integrating black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets coloaded with interleukin-4 (IL-4) together with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). BP nanosheets served as a biodegradable scaffold and a delivery vehicle, enabling sustained release of rhBMP-2 and IL-4 to enhance osteogenic differentiation and to promote anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization, respectively. The resulting spheroids exhibited a well-defined morphology, enhanced cell viability, and uniform BP nanosheet distribution. The in vitro studies demonstrated Sphe-BP-IL4-BMP2 has significantly upregulated osteogenic markers and ALP activity alongside potent immunomodulatory effects on macrophages. Further in vivo implantation into a rat calvarial defect model led to increased angiogenesis and accelerated bone regeneration without adverse effects.

This retrospective study aimed to identify the optimal MCIDs for commonly used PROMs in CSM.The CSM database from the Quality Outcomes Database SpineCORe Study Group was analyzed. Baseline, 3-month, and 24-month PROM values for Neck Disability Index (NDI), 5-dimension Euro-quality of life (EQ-5D) in quality-adjusted life years, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, and neck/arm pain numeric rating scale (NRS) were collected. MCIDs were calculated for each PROM using previously validated techniques. MCID values were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) with the North American Spine Society satisfaction scale as an anchor.A total of 1141 patients with CSM undergoing surgery were included in this analysis. Improvement of ≥30% from baseline was the optimal MCID for NDI and neck/arm NRS. At 24 months, the optimal percentage cutoff MCID for these instruments resulted in AUCs of 0.76, 0.72, and 0.67, similar to the 30% improvement method, with AUCs of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.67, respectively. Numeric cutoffs (0.065 at 3 months; 0.149 at 24 months) were the superior MCIDs for EQ-5D. For mJOA score, a severity-adjusted MCID outperformed other methods, yielding an AUC of 0.67 at 24 months. MCIDs were achieved in 63% of patients for NDI, 59% for neck pain NRS, 61% for arm pain NRS, 52% for EQ-5D, and 59% for mJOA score at 24 months.Using the Quality Outcomes Database SpineCORe data set, we defined optimal MCIDs for key PROMs in CSM. A ≥30% improvement from baseline was optimal in NDI and arm/neck NRS. An absolute numeric cutoff was superior for EQ-5D (0.149 at the 24-month follow-up).

This research study looked at a common heart condition called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiff and has trouble filling with blood. The researchers wanted to understand how obesity, a major risk factor for HFpEF, affects the small blood vessels in the heart. 

They examined 125 patients with HFpEF, some of whom were obese and some who were not. The researchers used specialized imaging tests to assess the function of the tiny coronary blood vessels in the heart. They found that patients with HFpEF who were not obese actually had a higher prevalence of coronary microvascular dysfunction - meaning their small heart blood vessels were not working properly. 

This was an unexpected result, as obesity is known to contribute to blood vessel problems. The findings suggest that the mechanisms driving HFpEF may differ between obese and non-obese patients. Understanding",Cardiology,
41512167,2026-01-10,Pomalidomide for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: After Trial Longitudinal Assessment Study (PATH-HHT ATLAS).,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) causes severe recurrent epistaxis, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, solid organ arteriovenous malformations, and a profound anemia burden. It is the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide yet remains without approved therapies. The multicenter U.S. randomized, controlled PATH-HHT trial demonstrated efficacy of short-term pomalidomide treatment of epistaxis in HHT. However, many critical questions regarding long-term safety, effectiveness, and utility for HHT-associated gastrointestinal bleeding remain. The PATH-HHT After Trial Longitudinal Assessment Study (NCT07018401) was a multicenter U.S. longitudinal observational study evaluating patients enrolled in PATH-HHT who continued pomalidomide post-PATH-HHT through a post-study drug access program, with ongoing close monitoring per PATH-HHT protocol and as mandated by FDA. Sixty-two patients treated with pomalidomide for HHT for up to 4.4 years were included. Significant, durable improvements in mean Epistaxis Severity Score (5.55 points [baseline] to 2.80 points [month 12], p<0.0001) and mean Hematologic Support Score (9.11 red-cell unit equivalents [RUEs] during 6 months pretreatment to 5.73 RUEs [months 7-12], p=0.0056) were observed. Pomalidomide was less effective for gastrointestinal bleeding than epistaxis, particularly in patients with high RBC transfusion requirements. Thirty-one patients (50%) dose-reduced from 4-mg daily, primarily due to neutropenia, but most maintained effectiveness at 2- or 3-mg daily. Over 105.2 patient-years of pomalidomide treatment, 0 patients developed peripheral neuropathy, 1 developed venous thromboembolism, and 5 developed serious infections. In conclusion, pomalidomide was highly and durably effective for HHT-associated epistaxis, albeit with nontrivial potential toxicities, and may be considered a routine long-term antiangiogenic therapeutic option for certain patients with HHT.

41511789,2026-01-10,Immune-Driven Expression in Inclusion Body Myositis With T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), reported in up to 58% of inclusion body myositis (IBM) patients, is a rare leukemia of cytotoxic or less commonly helper T cells. The range of myopathies in T-LGLL and the impact of coexisting T-LGLL in IBM are not well understood. Our objectives are to investigate the spectrum of myopathies in patients with T-LGLL and compare the clinical, serological, pathological, and transcriptomic features of IBM patients with and without T-LGLL.We reviewed two Mayo Clinic cohorts: (1) T-LGLL patients evaluated for myopathies (2003-2018), and (2) IBM patients tested for T-LGLL via T-cell receptor gene rearrangement or flow cytometry (2016-2022). We also compared transcriptomic profiles of IBM muscle biopsies with and without T-LGLL.Of 447 T-LGLL patients, 13 (2.9%) had myopathies, IBM being the most common (n = 7). Of 43 IBM patients, 9 (20.9%) had T-LGLL, with 5 diagnosed prior to the onset of weakness. Clinical and pathological features were largely similar between IBM patients with and without T-LGLL, except for milder finger flexor weakness and more frequent neutropenia (55.6% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) in the T-LGLL group. However, transcriptomic analysis of muscle tissues revealed a more immunologically active profile, with upregulation of T-cell and macrophage markers, elevated levels of IFN-γ gene and IFN-γ-inducible genes, heightened cytokine activity, and enhanced immunoglobulin production in IBM patients with T-LGLL.IBM is the most common myopathy in T-LGLL patients. While clinico-sero-pathological features were largely similar, transcriptomic differences suggest IBM with T-LGLL may represent a distinct, more immune-driven subtype.© 2026 The Author(s).

They found that IBM is the most common muscle disease seen in T-LGLL patients. While the outward symptoms of IBM were largely similar whether or not T-LGLL was present, the researchers discovered important differences at the genetic level. IBM patients with T-LGLL showed higher activity of immune system genes and proteins, suggesting their muscle disease may be driven more by an overactive immune response. This could mean IBM with T-LGLL represents a distinct subtype that may require different treatment approaches.

The nineteen studies included were peer-reviewed manuscripts focused on primary spine tumors, excluding abstracts, book chapters, systematic reviews, and metastatic studies.ResultsThe PT-Retro registry compiled data from 1495 patients across 18 primary tumor histologies, offering insights into recurrence, survival, and treatment paradigms. Key findings emphasize the importance of Enneking-appropriate (EA) resection in improving survival and reducing recurrence in tumors such as chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Genetic markers, including hTERT promoter mutations and rs2305089 SNP, were linked to prognosis in specific histologies. Benign tumors, such as giant cell tumors and aneurysmal bone cysts, demonstrated variable outcomes with different surgical approaches and selective arterial embolization.ConclusionsThe AOSKFT registries have significantly advanced knowledge in primary spine tumor management, emphasizing preoperative staging, surgical margins, and multidisciplinary approaches. International, multicentric registries are essential for studying rare diseases like primary spine tumors, enabling robust data collection, improved statistical power, and broader applicability of findings across diverse clinical settings.

41512289,2026-01-10,Postpartum breast cancer: evidence for a distinct phenotype.,"The incidence of early onset breast cancers (BCs) has increased, paralleling rising trends in delayed childbearing. We hypothesize that a distinct postpartum BC subtype (PPBC), identifiable by time since last birth (TSLB) and biomarker expression, contributes to this trend. We applied GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) to measure associations between TSLB and 71 proteins in 640 BCs from women ages ≤40 years included in the Young Women's BC Study. We analyzed data using univariable linear regression and multivariable Sliced Inverse Regression to account for higher order interactions among biomarkers. In keratin-rich segments, PR (p = 1.00x10-4) and PTEN (p = 1.00x10-3) were associated with longer TSLB; multivariable analyses revealed positive associations for GZMB (p = 4.00X10-4), SMA (1.00X10-4) and NF-1 (p = 1.00X10-3). In keratin-poor segments, univariable significant positive associations were found for PR (p = 2.00x10-4) and PTEN (p = 1.00x10-3), whereas CD20 (p = 3.00x10-4) and CTLA4 (p = 4.00x10-5) were negatively associated; multivariable significant associations were found for fibronectin (p = 3.00x10-5) and pan-Akt (p = 1.00x10-3). Associations persisted after adjustment for multiple comparisons and BC molecular subtypes. Associations including for PR, PTEN and CD20 were strongest among women with shortest TSLB. OPAL multiplex immunofluorescence assays for PR, PTEN, CD20, SMA and CTLA4, replicated several DSP findings, particularly when stratified by subtype and with compartment matching. In TCGA, RNA species linked to proteins associated with TSLB correlated strongly with a T cell exhaustion signature previously linked to poor prognosis among premenopausal women. These data support PPBC as a biologically coherent phenotype defined by TSLB and biomarker profile, with potential implications for prevention and therapy.© The Author(s) 2026.

41513883,2026-01-10,Patient-Perceived Overall Side Effect Bother at and After Cancer Treatment Discontinuation: An Analysis Using Commercial Cancer Trial Data.,"There is widespread interest among patients, clinicians, regulators and other constituents in post-treatment patient-reported cancer data. Side effect bother is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) that can capture an important aspect of tolerability. In this study, we examined side effect bother at cancer treatment discontinuation and post-discontinuation in commercial cancer trials. We sought to understand completion rates, the extent of bother and its association with other PROs.Data were evaluated from three trials in patients with solid tumours (renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer). Side effect bother was measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) GP5 item. Symptom items were drawn from FACIT and function items were drawn from the EQ-5D-3L. FACIT items, including the GP5, are on a 0-4 scale (higher = worse symptoms/bother), and were dichotomised as 0-1 (""low"") vs 2-4 (""moderate""). EQ-5D-3L items were characterised as no problems (1) and some problems (2-3). Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted separately for each trial.Among patients who received treatment, completion rates at discontinuation for most items were at least 70%, and 52% to 78% at follow up. More than 20% of patients had high side effect bother at and after discontinuation, and similar percentages were seen for symptom items and functioning problems. GP5 and most items were at least somewhat correlated (≥ 0.2 in nearly all evaluations).Persistent side effect bother and symptomatic and functional detriments at and after discontinuation suggest capturing this information post-treatment can inform understanding of tolerability, particularly with improved PRO completion.© 2025.

Understanding this is important because patients' experiences with side effects can significantly impact their quality of life and willingness to continue treatment. 

The researchers analyzed data from three clinical trials involving patients with solid tumor cancers like kidney and breast cancer. They measured how much patients were bothered by side effects at the time they stopped treatment, as well as in the period after treatment ended. They also looked at how side effect bother related to other symptoms and daily functioning. 

The key findings were that over 20% of patients reported moderate-to-severe side effect bother both during and after stopping treatment. Many patients also reported ongoing problems with symptoms and daily activities. These results suggest that capturing patients' experiences after treatment can provide important insights into the full impact of cancer therapies.

41514053,2026-01-10,A single-cell atlas characterizes dysregulation of the bone marrow immune microenvironment associated with outcomes in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite advances in treatment options. Although tumor subtypes and specific DNA abnormalities are linked to worse prognosis, the impact of immune dysfunction on disease emergence and/or treatment sensitivity remains unclear. We developed an Immune Atlas of MM by generating profiles of 1,397,272 single cells from the bone marrow (BM) of 337 newly diagnosed participants and characterized immune and hematopoietic cell populations. Cytogenetic risk-based analysis revealed heterogeneous associations with T cells of BM, with 17p13 deletion showing distinct enrichment of a type 1 interferon signature. The disease progression-based analysis revealed the presence of a proinflammatory immune senescence-associated secretory phenotype in rapidly progressing participants. Furthermore, signaling analyses suggested active intercellular communication involving a proliferation-inducing ligand and B cell maturation antigen, potentially promoting tumor growth and survival. Lastly, using independent discovery and validation cohorts, we demonstrated that integrating immune cell signatures with known tumor cytogenetics and individual characteristics significantly improves stratification for the prediction of survival.© 2025.

In this study, researchers aimed to better understand the role of the immune system in multiple myeloma by analyzing individual cells from the bone marrow of over 300 patients. They used advanced technology to profile over 1.3 million individual cells, allowing them to map out the different immune and blood cell populations present. 

The researchers found that certain genetic changes in the cancer cells were linked to distinct patterns in the surrounding immune cells. For example, patients with a high-risk genetic change called 17p13 deletion had immune cells that showed a heightened inflammatory response. They also identified signs of ""immune senescence"" - a premature aging of the immune system - in patients whose cancer was progressing rapidly. Importantly, the team discovered potential communication pathways between the cancer cells and immune cells that may promote tumor growth.

41514247,2026-01-10,Effectiveness of tuina and physiotherapy to manage pain for patients with chronic low back pain: a pragmatic randomized clinical trial.,"Chronic non-specific low back pain lacks a defined pathoanatomical cause, leading to diverse treatment methods including physiotherapy and complementary alternative medicine techniques such as Tuina. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tuina for managing chronic non-specific low back pain by comparing it to physiotherapy and a combination of physiotherapy and Tuina.In this randomized, parallel-controlled, single-blind trial, 204 participants aged 21 to 75 with chronic non-specific low back pain were randomly assigned to physiotherapy, Tuina, or combined therapy. Pain intensity and quality of life were measured with the visual analog scale, 36-Item Short Form Survey and the Oswestry Disability Index, alongside trunk range of motion. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, two months, and five months. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for within- and between-group comparisons, and post-hoc tests were applied to between-group comparisons.After two months, all groups had significant improvement in pain scores. Tuina was only significantly better than the combination treatment for reducing pain (p = 0.021; mean difference = - 1.04 [95% CI - 1.85 to - 0.23], Cohen's d = - 0.41). However, no significant difference was observed between Tuina and combined treatment against physiotherapy. Pain scores were not significantly different at five months in all groups. The physiotherapy (p = 0.019; mean difference = - 5.28 [95% CI - 9.44 to - 1.11], d = - 0.44) and combined (p = 0.028; mean difference = 5.59 [95% CI 1.17 to 10.01], d = 0.42) groups showed a significant reduction in Oswestry Disability Index scores compared to Tuina at five months. The combined group had significantly greater 36-Item Short-Form Survey than Tuina (p = 0.012; mean difference = - 71.15 [95% CI - 118.23 to - 24.06], d = - 0.47), but not significantly greater than physiotherapy.All treatment groups demonstrated improved outcomes post-intervention and at five months. Between-group differences in improvement were significant only for Oswestry Disability Index and 36-Item Short-Form Survey scores at five months.

41518136,2026-01-11,Voice and Speech in Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders.,"Motor speech disorders are early, common, and functionally limiting features of atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). These impairments are underrecognized and undertreated in neurology clinics.This review aims to characterize speech impairment in APDs, offer practical guidance for clinical evaluation, highlight the role of Speech-Language pathologists (SLPs) in diagnosis and management, and outline current and emerging management strategies.A narrative review was conducted by the Diagnosis and Treatment Working Group of CurePSP's Centers of Care, integrating literature and clinical experience to summarize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of motor speech disorders in APDs.Speech changes in APDs are often mixed dysarthrias with hypokinetic, spastic, and/or ataxic components, and may include apraxia of speech; these are frequently more severe and progress quicker than in Parkinson's disease. These features can assist in differential diagnosis and should prompt early referral to SLPs. Despite the high prevalence of speech and voice changes, comprehensive assessment of motor speech disorders is uncommon in neurology clinics. Current evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions is mixed. Digital acoustic analysis and neuromodulation offer promising directions for diagnosis and treatment.Early, collaborative management of motor speech impairment elevates care in APDs. Neurologists and SLPs must work together to improve recognition, diagnosis, and care.

41391462,2026-01-11,"Proton versus photon radiotherapy for patients with oropharyngeal cancer in the USA: a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.","Radiotherapy is an integral component of treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. Toxicity from the current state-of-the-art photon radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), has prompted the search for alternative, less toxic therapies. One such alternative that might de-intensify treatment is proton therapy. In this trial, we aimed to directly compare IMRT with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), both concurrent with systemic therapy, hypothesising comparable disease control and survival and lower toxicity.This randomised, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial was conducted in 21 sites (cancer centres or universities) in the USA. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with stage III or stage IV oropharyngeal cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IMPT or IMRT. All patients were treated with radiotherapy to 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the primary tumour site and cervical lymphadenopathy. The type, schedule, and dose of induction or concurrent systemic therapy were chosen locally by each institution's multidisciplinary tumour board and were consistent with international guidelines. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population; safety outcomes were assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, patients who received the assigned therapy). A non-inferiority margin of 9 percentage points for progression-free survival at 3 years was used. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01893307) and is closed to further accrual after prespecified interim analysis.From Oct 10, 2013, to May 1, 2022, 440 patients consented (median age 61 years [IQR 55-68], 399 [91%] male, 409 [93%] White); 221 were allocated to the IMPT group (with 160 [72%] receiving IMPT) and 219 to the IMRT group (136 [62%] receiving IMRT). At a median follow-up time of 3·2 years, progression-free survival rates for the IMPT group were 82·5% (95% CI 76·1-87·3) at 3 years and 81·3% (74·5-86·5) at 5 years; corresponding rates for the IMRT group were 83·0% (76·7-87·7) and 76·2% (68·0-82·6; hazard ratio [HR] 0·88 [95% CI 0·57-1·35]; p=0·005 for non-inferiority of IMPT). Overall survival rates after IMPT were 90·9% at 5 years versus 81·0% after IMRT (HR 0·58 [95% CI 0·34-0·99]; p=0·045). Treatment-related deaths occurred in nine patients; six in the IMRT group and three in the IMPT group. Deaths from disease progression occurred in 27 patients; 18 in the IMRT group and nine in the IMPT group. 5-year disease control rates for IMPT versus IMRT were similar between treatment groups (local recurrences 2·9% vs 5·6%, p=0·474; regional recurrences 3·4% vs 3·2%, p=0·860; and distant metastases 9·1% vs 8·9%, p=0·897). Severe lymphopenia was more common in the IMRT group (89% vs 76%), as were dysphagia (49% vs 31%), xerostomia (45% vs 33%), and gastrostomy tube dependence (40·2% vs 26·8%; p=0·018).IMPT showed non-inferiority to IMRT for progression-free survival, improvement in overall survival, similar disease control, and reduced high-grade toxicity relative to IMRT.

41521187,2026-01-12,"Biologics for bone regeneration: advances in cell, protein, gene, and mRNA therapies.","Bone fractures represent a significant global healthcare burden. Although fractures typically heal on their own, some fail to regenerate properly, leading to nonunion, a condition that causes prolonged disability, morbidity, and mortality. The challenge of treating nonunion fractures is further complicated in patients with underlying bone disorders where systemic and local factors impair bone healing. Traditional treatment approaches, including autografts, allografts, xenografts, and synthetic biomaterials, face limitations such as donor site pain, immune rejection, and insufficient mechanical strength, underscoring the need for alternative strategies. Biologic therapies have emerged as promising tools to enhance bone regeneration by leveraging the body's natural healing processes. This review explores the critical role of conventional and emerging biologics in fracture healing. We categorize biologic therapies into protein-based treatments, gene and transcript therapies, small molecules, peptides, and cell-based therapies, highlighting their mechanisms of action, advantages, and clinical relevance. Finally, we examine the potential applications of biologics in treating fractures associated with bone disorders such as osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, and bone tumors. By integrating biologic therapies with existing biomaterial-based strategies, these innovative approaches have the potential to transform clinical management and improve outcomes for patients with difficult-to-heal fractures.© 2026.

Despite multimodality therapy, the tumor carries poor prognosis. We report cytomorphological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular features of seven cases of DSRCT from four patients.A retrospective review of cytology smears, biopsies and molecular features of cases diagnosed as DSRCT at Department of Pathology, Henry Ford Health System, and Indiana University, USA between 2016 and 2022 were performed. A total of seven cases of DSRCT from four patients were included in this study. The cytological findings were correlated with concurrent or subsequent biopsy findings.All patients were male, with age ranging from 21 to 29 years. Two patients had primary tumor in the abdomen, one in the retroperitoneum, and one in the inguinal region. The tumors measured from 7.5 to 17 cm in size. Six out of seven cases showed typical hypercellular smears of small round cells with inconspicuous nucleoli, scant cytoplasm, and rare nuclear molding. The cytomorphology in Case no. 1 was unusual, showing discohesive pleomorphic tumor cells with large irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, occasional binucleation, and frequent mitotic activity. A subset of tumor cells demonstrated rhabdoid features. The tumor cells were positive for keratins (dot-like), desmin, WT-1, and CD15. In Case no. 4, the immunohistochemistry for desmin and WT-1 was unusually negative reflecting the variability of the staining pattern. Three cases were positive for EWSR1 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and one positive for EWSR1-WTI gene fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All seven cases had concurrent/subsequent surgical pathology diagnosis consistent with DSRCT.Cytologic diagnosis for DSRCT is challenging but can be achieved with appropriate cytomorphology, IHC profiles, molecular studies, and demographic information.

However, the high degree of expertise and manual analysis time required limits the availability of this assay. To overcome this limitation, we developed a data-enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline that accelerates and simplifies MRD analysis. Unaltered FC files from 171 B-ALL MRD-positive and 89 MRD-negative cases were processed through an AI pipeline trained with 31 expert-gated negative controls. Cluster-informed downsampling reduced FC files from 1.2 million to 155 884 cells per case, on average, (87% cellularity reduction), whereas preserving small MRD populations (median, 100% retention for MRD of <1%) and allowing for true percentage MRD estimates using a correction factor. A deep neural network cell classifier automatically identified normal hematopoietic subsets (macro-averaged F1 score of 0.86); and an AI measure of anomaly discriminated B-ALL from benign mononuclear (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.98) or B-lymphoid cells (AUC of 0.94). Manual analysis of AI-enhanced files was completed in only 1.01 minutes per case, on average (standard deviation of ±0.57); with 100% positive agreement with conventional analysis (for MRD of ≥0.01%), 100% negative agreement, and excellent quantitative correlation (R2 = 0.92). Our cloud-based AI-enhancement solution accelerates B-ALL MRD identification without compromising test performance and has the potential of facilitating B-ALL MRD analysis by more clinical laboratories.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

Data from previous outbreaks indicate lasting health problems in survivors. The long-term neurologic impact of EVD remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the neurologic and neurocognitive sequelae of EVD in pediatric survivors of the 2015 outbreak in Liberia.In this cross-sectional observational study conducted in Monrovia, Liberia, pediatric survivors of acute EVD aged younger than 18 years at the time of infection and older than 2 years at the time of the visit, along with their asymptomatic close contacts as controls, were seen at a median of 18 months after EVD. The single clinic visit included a neurologic history and symptom questionnaire, neurologic examination, and neurocognitive testing. Seropositive survivors and seronegative controls were included in analyses, with the t test used for continuous variables and the χ2 or Fisher exact test used for categorical variables.The cohort included 31 EVD cases and 41 controls, with a median age of 11 years (44% female). Neurologic symptoms that were reported significantly more frequently in cases than in controls included arm/leg weakness (67.7% vs 4.9%, p < 0.0001); problems with sitting, standing, or walking (22.6% vs 4.9%, p = 0.031); difficulty seeing (38.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.003); difficulty understanding speech (32.3% vs 0%, p < 0.0001); fecal incontinence (19.4% vs 0%, p = 0.0051); and lack of motivation (22.2% vs 0%, p = 0.0052). EVD cases more often demonstrated disability than controls on the modified Rankin Scale. EVD cases ""either sometimes or often"" faced consequences for poor behavior, became upset for unknown reasons, and had difficulty completing tasks independently more often than controls on executive function assessment. There was no significant difference between groups in individual neurologic examination components, frequency of uveitis, or cognitive test scores.Numerous neurologic symptoms were reported more commonly in EVD cases than in controls, suggesting that EVD may have a lasting effect on the nervous system.

However, there has been limited research on patients' informational preferences, including which elements of AI device labeling enhance patient understanding, trust, and acceptance. Clear and effective patient-facing communication is essential to address patient concerns and support informed decision-making regarding AI-enabled care.We evaluated 3 aims using simulated AI device labels in a cardiovascular context. First, we identified key information elements that influence patient trust and acceptance of an AI device. Second, we examined how these effects varied based on patient characteristics. Third, we explored how patients evaluated informational content of AI labels and their perceived effectiveness of the AI labels in informing decision-making about the use of AI device, building trust in the device, and shaping their intention to use it in their health care.We recruited 340 US patients from ResearchMatch.org to participate in a web-based survey that contained 2 experiments. In the discrete choice experiment, participants indicated preferences in terms of trust and acceptance regarding 16 pairs of simulated AI device labels that varied across 8 types of information needs identified in our previous qualitative work. In the single profile factorial experiment, participants evaluated 4 randomly assigned label prototypes regarding the label's legibility, comprehensibility, information overload, credibility, and perceived effectiveness in informing about the AI device, as well as participants' trust in the AI device and intention to use the device in their health care. Data were analyzed using mixed effects binary or ordinal logistic regression.The discrete choice experiment showed that information about regulatory approval, high device performance, provider oversight, and AI's value added to usual care significantly increased the likelihood of patient trust by 14.1%-19.3% and acceptance by 13.3%-17.9%. Subgroup analyses revealed variations based on patient characteristics such as familiarity with AI, health literacy, and recency of last medical checkup. The single profile factorial experiment showed that patients reported good label comprehension, and that information about provider oversight, regulatory approval, device performance, and AI's added value improved perceived credibility and effectiveness of the AI label (odds ratio [OR] range: 1.35-2.05), reduced doubts in the AI device (OR range: 0.61-0.77), and increased trust and intention to use the AI device (OR range: 1.47-1.73). However, information about data privacy and safety management protocols was less influential.Patients value information about an AI device's performance, provider oversight, regulatory status, and added value during decision-making. Providing transparent, easily understandable information about these aspects is critical to support patient determinations of trust and acceptance of AI-enabled health care.

41521918,2026-01-13,Recurrent Cervical Artery Dissection Prevalence and Predictors: A Secondary Analysis of the STOP-CAD Study.,"Patients with cervical artery dissection (CeAD) may experience a recurrent dissection, but its frequency, risk factors, and clinical implications are not well defined. We aimed to determine the risk, associated factors, and clinical impact of recurrent CeAD.The STOP-CAD study was a multicenter international retrospective observational study of patients with CeAD treated between January 2015 and June 2022. Recurrent dissection was defined as a CeAD occurring at least 7 days after the diagnosis of the index event that affects a different artery or a different segment of the same artery. Patients were followed from day 7 up to 2 years. The absolute risk of recurrent CeAD over time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess predictors of CeAD recurrence.Of the 4023 patients included in STOP-CAD, 3836 (median age 46 years, 45% females) were eligible for this analysis. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 295 (97-720) days, 88 (2.29%) patients had a CeAD recurrence. Median time-to-recurrent CeAD was 53 (interquartile range, 18-157) days. The estimated risk of recurrent CeAD at 2 years was 3.22% (95% CI, 2.59%-4.00%). In multivariable analyses, younger age (adjusted odds ratios, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), migraine (adjusted odds ratio, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.14-3.07]), and fibromuscular dysplasia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.66-5.06]) were associated with CeAD recurrence, while presenting with an ischemic stroke was associated with a lower likelihood of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29-0.75]).

In the phase 3 CABINET trial, cabozantinib improved PFS compared with placebo in patients with advanced, previously treated, progressive extra-pancreatic NET (epNET) and pancreatic NET (pNET) of all grades. Here, we evaluate if these results remain consistent in a subgroup of patients with well-differentiated G3 NET.Patients with locally advanced or metastatic epNET or pNET were randomized 2:1 in independent cohorts to receive cabozantinib 60 mg daily vs placebo. We analyzed outcomes of the subset of patients with G3 NETs (Ki67>20%), combining patients in the pNET and epNET cohorts due to small sample sizes.24 patients had G3 NETs, 16 randomized to cabozantinib and 8 to placebo. Primary sites included pancreas (n=12); GI tract (n=7); unknown primary (n=3); lung/ thymus (n=2).

41524747,2026-01-13,Optimal timing of anticoagulation after ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Timing for anticoagulation (AC) initiation in atrial fibrillation (AF) after ischemic stroke (IS) remains uncertain. Previous large studies mostly represented high-income countries, with limited representation of severe stroke and low rates of primary outcomes. We aimed to compare AC initiation at different timeframes in a broader and more diverse population.We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinical Trials for trials and observational studies comparing early versus late AC initiation in AF after IS. The study groups were 0-4, 5-14, and ≥ 15 days. Primary endpoints were recurrent IS only and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Secondary endpoints included systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Sensitivity analysis focused on studies using direct oral anticoagulants and timing categories consistent with our classification.Our meta-analysis included 20 studies with 25,884 patients. Mean NIHSS was 6.14, with at least 3204 severe strokes. IS was similar between groups, but the 0-4 days strategy ranked first (P-score = 0.92). Sensitivity analysis showed reduced recurrent IS in the 0-4 days group versus the ≥ 15 days group (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.65; P < 0.01). ICH had no difference across all periods, 0-4 days versus 5-14 days (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.58-2.18; P = 0.14); ≥ 15 days versus 5-14 days (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.65; P = 0.75); and 0-4 days versus ≥ 15 days (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49-1.55; P = 0.63). No differences were observed in all secondary outcomes.Initiating AC 0-4 days after IS appears safe and may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke without increasing ICH, even in a more diverse population with higher-bleeding risk.© 2025.

PERT products composed of pancrelipase (under the brand names Creon, Zenpep, Pancreaze, Viokace, Pertzye) differ in formulation-specific attributes and access/coverage considerations. Multiple factors impact healthcare providers' (HCPs) decision-making when selecting an appropriate PERT. The current study's primary objective is to assess real-world EPI management practice and HCP perceptions of PERT products in the United States.An online survey was carried out with HCPs who had treated patients with EPI for ≥ 3 years and prescribed PERT products to ≥ 10 patients over a 12-month period. The survey collected de-identified data on HCP characteristics, prescribing patterns, and perceptions of PERT products across the domains of efficacy, convenience, and access. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and HCPs' perceptions were compared across PERT products.A total of 250 HCPs were surveyed comprising 124 specialists, 95 generalists, and 31 advanced practice providers. HCPs managed a median of 30 patients with EPI on PERT in the 12 months preceding the survey. The most commonly prescribed PERT products were Creon (84.0%), Zenpep (60.4%), and Pancreaze (59.2%), with fewer HCPs prescribing Viokace (27.2%) and Pertzye (16.0%). Specific factors considered in prescribing decisions included improvement in abdominal and bowel symptoms (83.6%), affordability (72.4%), and formulary/insurance coverage (72.0%). A significantly higher proportion of HCPs reported favorable perceptions of Creon over other PERT products. Perceptions of formulary/insurance coverage across PERT products varied, with 8.0-56.0% of HCPs agreeing or strongly agreeing that a prescribed product had good coverage. These findings were generally consistent across different provider types.HCPs consider multiple factors when prescribing PERT for patients with EPI. HCP perceptions varied across PERT products, and Creon was favorably perceived more often compared to the other therapeutic options. Various factors may contribute to barriers to treatment and should be addressed to improve access.© 2025.

41104834,2026-01-13,ID2 Suppresses Multiple Myeloma Cell Proliferation by Repressing the Activity of the Transcription Factor TCF3.,"Transcription factors and their cofactors are major and selective nononcogene dependencies in multiple myeloma cells. By performing a gain-of-function perturbation screen in human multiple myeloma cell lines, we identified the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) genes as putative suppressors of multiple myeloma cell fitness. Among them, ID2 was found to be downregulated in multiple myeloma patient cells and acted as a tumor suppressor by directly binding and repressing the basic helix-loop-helix factor TCF3, also known as E2A. Lower ID2 expression in multiple myeloma cells conferred a proliferative advantage by increasing TCF3 activity, leading to a dependency on this transcription factor. In contrast, ID2 overexpression reduced TCF3 binding to DNA, which resulted in cell-cycle arrest and a halt in multiple myeloma cell proliferation. The myeloma bone marrow milieu supported this process by further decreasing the expression of ID2 and enhancing TCF3 activity, partly via IL6, revealing a mechanism by which the tumor microenvironment affects multiple myeloma cell behavior.Multiple myeloma cells exploit the oncogenic and proliferative potential of TCF3 by downregulating the transcriptional regulator ID2, a process facilitated by the bone marrow microenvironment.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Blood cancer discovery,"Jan 12, 2026",2026.0,Jan,12.0,Mariateresa Fulciniti|Yao Yao|Tommaso Perini|Jessica Fong Ng|Anaïs Schavgoulidze|Shuhui Deng|Jian Cui|Jessica Encinas Mayoral|Francesco Ladisa|Ryan M Young|Charles B Epstein|Cassandra M White|Christopher J Ott|Annamaria Gulla|Shannon M Matulis|Adam S Sperling|Eugenio Morelli|Lawrence H Boise|Moritz Binder|Raphael Szalat|Mehmet K Samur|Kenneth C Anderson|Nikhil C Munshi,Moritz Binder,"Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Blood Diseases Institute, Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.|Laboratory of Age Related Diseases, Division of Genetics and Cell Biology and Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.|State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Haihe Laboratory of Cell Ecosystem, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.|Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.|The Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts.|Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology and the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.|Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Candiolo, Italy.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.","Mariateresa Fulciniti, Yao Yao, Tommaso Perini, Jessica Fong Ng, Anaïs Schavgoulidze, Shuhui Deng, Jian Cui, Jessica Encinas Mayoral, Francesco Ladisa, Ryan M Young, Charles B Epstein, Cassandra M White, Christopher J Ott, Annamaria Gulla, Shannon M Matulis, Adam S Sperling, Eugenio Morelli, Lawrence H Boise, Moritz Binder, Raphael Szalat, Mehmet K Samur, Kenneth C Anderson, Nikhil C Munshi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41104834/,"This research examines a potential new way to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow.

41525598,2026-01-13,Anatomic subsets of cholangiocarcinoma: More different than alike.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of biliary tract malignancies. Growing evidence underscores that the three major anatomic subtypes - intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA), and distal (dCCA) - are distinct tumor entities rather than a single disease. Each subtype differs in embryologic origin, carcinogenesis mechanisms, molecular landscape, and immunogenic profile, all of which contribute to variability in diagnosis, treatment responsiveness and prognosis. The importance of understanding these distinctions is reinforced by the rising global incidence of CCA, highlighting precision medicine approaches based on these subtypes. Recent advances have deepened our insight into subtype-specific risk factors, including chronic biliary diseases and metabolic conditions, while artificial intelligence-driven tools are improving diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. Surgical innovations now allow for more tailored resections and perioperative care, and therapeutic strategies are increasingly guided by molecular and immune profiling. Emerging strategies for early diagnosis and chemoprevention in high-risk populations further emphasize the significance of recognizing the unique biology of each subtype. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the distinct anatomic subsets of CCA, integrating their molecular and biological foundations with clinical management to inform practice and guide future research.Copyright © 2026 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Jan 12, 2026",2026.0,Jan,12.0,Yawen Dong|Hannah E Stumpf|Rory L Smoot|Patrick P Starlinger|Mark M Yarchoan|Gregory J Gores|Sumera I Ilyas,Yawen Dong|Hannah E Stumpf|Rory L Smoot|Patrick P Starlinger|Gregory J Gores|Sumera I Ilyas,"Department of Surgery, Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, Rochester, USA.|Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Oncology, Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Yawen Dong, Hannah E Stumpf, Rory L Smoot, Patrick P Starlinger, Mark M Yarchoan, Gregory J Gores, Sumera I Ilyas",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41525598/,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of cancer that starts in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine.

Tucatinib plus trastuzumab showed clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety. Efficacy was observed irrespective of central HER2+ testing methods and in patients with heterogeneous tumor biomarker profiles.© 2026.

The current guideline describes the gene-drug interactions between CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and various tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). For CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PM), dose reductions are advised for amitriptyline (reduction to 60% of the normal dose), clomipramine (reduction to 50% of the normal dose for the indication depression or in case of side effects at the normal dose for the other indications), doxepin (reduction to 40% of normal dose), imipramine (30% of the normal dose), and nortriptyline (40%). For CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IM) reduced dose is also recommended for amitriptyline (75%), clomipramine (70%), doxepin (80%), imipramine (70%), and nortriptyline (60%). Also, CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (UM) require tailored dose adjustments: amitriptyline (1.6 times the normal dose), clomipramine (1.5 times), doxepin (2 times), imipramine (1.7 times), and nortriptyline (1.7 times). Additionally, alternative drugs may be needed for CYP2D6 UM due to potential safety concerns. For CYP2C19 PM, a 70% dose reduction is advised for imipramine. For CYP2C19 IM, no action is required for TCAs. For CYP2C19 UM, an alternative medication is recommended for clomipramine prescribed for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The DPWG classifies CYP2D6 genotyping for all five TCAs and CYP2C19 genotyping for clomipramine in patients with anxiety disorders or OCD, and for imipramine as being ""potentially beneficial"".

41526676,2026-01-13,Deep learning-based classification of thyroid nodules using uncertainty-aware multi-modal ultrasound imaging.,"Accurate differentiation of thyroid nodules is crucial for timely diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Most recent studies utilize grayscale ultrasound with deep learning to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. The goal of this study is to effectively boost the performance of classification of thyroid nodules using multi-modal ultrasound imaging combining B-mode, color Doppler (CD), and shear wave elastography (SWE) within a customized deep learning architecture. This study prospectively included 506 thyroid nodules acquired from 422 subjects. The proposed network integrated a pretrained MobileNetV2 backbone with a shallow head composed of depth-wise separable convolutional layers, attention-based mixed pooling, and a tailored self-attention mechanism-applied for the first time in the context of thyroid nodule classification. To further improve robustness, we introduced a patient-level uncertainty-aware fusion strategy that selectively integrates predictions from each modality based on their validation scheme and achieved a classification accuracy of 0.95, a sensitivity (Sen) of 0.98, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99), a specificity of 0.92, and an F1 score of 0.95, on test data. Multi-modal images improved the performance (AUC: 0.97) as compared to uni-modal (AUC range: 0.73-0.90) or bi-modal (AUC range: 0.90-0.97) data. Further comparative analysis showed that the proposed network performed similarly or better to the state-of-art deep learning networks (AUC range: 0.82 -0.97) for thyroid nodule classification while utilizing relatively smaller architecture. Finally, the integration of multi-modal ultrasound imaging with a customized deep learning network effectively and efficiently improved the overall classification of thyroid nodules, which can further enhance diagnostic performance.© 2026.

Diagnosis to ablation time (DAT) was calculated from the date when the initial AF episode was documented. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding or cardiac arrest. Secondary end points included AF recurrence, all-cause mortality, and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalisation. Associations between DAT and post-ablation outcomes were evaluated by restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves based on Cox models.Out of 1145 patients (median age 67.0 years, interquartile range (IQR) 61.0-72.0; 36.7% female) included, 538 (47.0%) underwent early ablation (DAT ≤ 1 year), including 242 (45.0%) who received very early ablation (DAT ≤ 90 days). The overall median DAT was 423 days (IQR 118-1473). The L-shaped association was observed between DAT and the primary outcome (P for non-linear = 0.034). The lowest point was located at a DAT of approximately 1 to 3 years. For AF recurrences, the RCS curve rose progressively with increasing DAT (P for non-linear = 0.062), showing a reduced risk when DAT was less than 1 year. Effects of early ablation on the primary outcome favoured patients with initial AAD use (HR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.73 vs. HR 2.20, 95% CI p-interaction = 0.045).The benefits of earlier ablation in reducing AF recurrence might not equate to improvements in post-ablation cardiovascular prognosis.

In 2021, a meningitis diagnosis and treatment program (MEN-DTP) began to include all etiologies of meningitis to assess the impact of expanded diagnosis and treatment of meningitis. We conducted a retrospective study utilizing clinical records from 1443 adult patients admitted to Lira Regional Referral Hospital (LRRH) over three time periods between 2015-2024. Group 1 included 321 patients in a historical control group; Group 2 consisted of 890 patients during the CM-DTP and Group 3 included 232 patients during the MEN-DTP. Group 1 received routine meningitis care, Group 2 received testing and treatment focused on CM, and Group 3 received expanded diagnostic testing, including gram stain, culture, PCR- and antigen-based testing. Meningitis diagnosis and in-hospital mortality outcomes were assessed to evaluate our programs. A confirmed meningitis etiology was found in 13.7% in Group 1, 20.7% in Group 2, and 42.2% in Group 3. In Group 3, confirmed etiologies were identified based on culture (n = 30), Pastorex LA (n = 23), BioFire PCR (n = 56), GeneXpert Ultra (n = 14), and serum or CSF CrAg LFA (n = 53). Overall, more confirmed etiologies of meningitis were identified among people living with HIV (PLWH) (n = 319) compared to those without HIV (n = 22) in Group 3. Antibiotic use increased with pre-admission antibiotic use doubling from Group 1 to Group 3 (10.6% to 27.2%). Compared to Group 1, mortality improved in Groups 2 and 3.

There are limited prospective, multicenter data available on VBT following US Food and Drug Administration approval. We hypothesize that curve correction on first postoperative standing (first erect, FE) imaging is associated with higher rates of successful correction at final follow-up.All qualifying patients with AIS who underwent thoracic and lumbar VBT between 2019 and 2022 were prospectively enrolled from 9 institutions. Radiographic and clinical data were compared preoperatively, at FE, and at final follow-up with minimum of 2 years. Success was defined as major curve magnitude of ≤35° at final follow-up and no fusion surgery.One hundred twenty-seven patients were enrolled (79.5% female), with mean follow-up 2.4 years. Mean age at surgery was 12.9 ± 1.4 years, most had bone age of Sanders 4 or lower (93/112, 83.0%). In average, 7.6 ± 1.7 levels were tethered. Mean preoperative major curve magnitude was 50 ± 8°, with mean initial correction at FE of 29 ± 8° (% correction, 39 ± 18%). At final follow-up, mean curve magnitude was maintained at 26 ± 11° (% correction, 45 ± 23%) despite 29% of tether breakage. Patients who had mean FE curve magnitude of ≤35° were 88% successful compared with only 60% in those with >35° on FE (p = 0.0021). Patients showed stable sagittal alignment across all timepoints.

Mitochondrial stress, created by accumulation of misfolded proteins, reactive oxygen species, and other mechanisms, triggers signals that promote changes in protein translation and gene transcription aimed at protecting and restoring mitochondrial function and maintaining cellular homeostasis. These quality control responses are the integrated stress response and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. When triggered by mild mitochondrial stress, these adaptive responses promote mitohormesis, which enhances cell survival and lifespan. The exchange of information between mitochondria allows mitochondrial stress in specific tissues to initiate beneficial adaptations affecting mitochondrial populations in remote tissues and organs. Experimental and human observational studies indicate that approaches to trigger mitohormesis, such as physical exercise, have beneficial effects in neurodegenerative disorders.",Neurology,"Feb 10, 2026",2026.0,Feb,10.0,Eduardo Benarroch,Eduardo Benarroch,"From the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.",Eduardo Benarroch,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41529230/,"This research explores the role of mitochondria, the powerhouses of our cells, in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

41530145,2026-01-14,CD39 polymorphism enables lung thrombosis in sickle cell disease.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic-hemolytic disorder affecting people of African ancestry. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) released following intravascular hemolysis activates platelets by stimulating purinergic receptors to promote thrombosis. Despite brisk intravascular hemolysis, which releases high levels of ADP into plasma, and evidence of platelet and hemostatic activation, it remains elusive why only a subset of SCD patients develop lung thrombosis. Using real-time in vivo lung microscopy, we report a surprising finding that humanized SCD mice are protected from ADP-induced lung thrombosis, which is secondary to the degradation of ADP by CD39 present in circulating extracellular vesicles released by the lung endothelium. ADP-induced platelet aggregation is also impaired in the blood of SCD patients with elevated levels of CD39+ extracellular vesicles. CD39 polymorphism rs3176891A→G is associated with the incidence of lung thrombosis in SCD patients but not healthy humans of African ancestry.

The researchers used advanced microscopy techniques in mice and analyzed blood samples from sickle cell patients to investigate the role of a protein called CD39. They found that CD39, which is present in tiny vesicles released by the lung's blood vessels, helps break down a chemical called ADP that can activate platelets and promote clotting. Interestingly, a specific genetic variation in the CD39 gene was associated with an increased risk of lung clots in sickle cell patients, but not in healthy individuals of African descent.

This research paper examines the relationship between a patient's physical fitness and their recovery after surgery. The study is important because many people undergoing major operations are at risk of complications, such as infections or prolonged hospital stays, which can negatively impact their health and quality of life. The researchers analyzed data from previous studies to understand how a patient's level of physical activity and overall fitness before surgery might influence their postoperative outcomes.

The key findings show that patients who are more physically active and have higher fitness levels tend to experience better results after their procedures. They are less likely to develop complications, spend less time in the hospital, and recover more quickly compared to patients who are less physically fit. The researchers suggest that encouraging patients to improve their physical fitness before surgery, through activities like exercise programs, may help optimize their bodies for the stress of the operation and lead to better overall health outcomes.

41530471,2026-01-14,Comparative outcomes of microsurgical and endovascular treatment for ruptured and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms.,"Anterior communicating artery (AComA) aneurysms remain challenging because of their complex anatomy, rupture risk, and proximity to vital structures. This study compared the long-term durability, retreatment rates, complications, and outcomes of microsurgical clipping and endovascular treatment. This retrospective study included 313 patients (≥ 18 years) with ruptured or unruptured AComA aneurysms treated at a single center (2006-2024). Patients were categorized by treatment modality into two groups: (1) Microsurgical clipping and (2) Endovascular treatment. Primary outcomes included aneurysm occlusion status, retreatment, and functional recovery, measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the modified Rankin Scale. Of the 313 patients, 166 (53.0%) underwent microsurgical clipping, and 147 (47.0%) received endovascular treatment. Complete occlusion was achieved in 98.2% of the microsurgical group compared to 38.1% in the endovascular group (p < 0.001). Retreatment was required for 15.6% of endovascular patients (excluding planned two-stage procedures), while no retreatments occurred for the microsurgical group (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in functional outcomes between treatment groups at discharge and follow-up. Mean aneurysm size was smaller for ruptured aneurysms (5.82 mm) than unruptured ones (6.80 mm; p = 0.020), and diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in the unruptured group (27.5% vs. 8.1%; p < 0.001). Microsurgical clipping provided significantly higher rates of complete occlusion and lower retreatment rates compared to endovascular coiling, with equivalent functional outcomes. These findings support the continued role of microsurgery for treating AComA aneurysms, particularly in patients requiring durable occlusion and less intensive long-term surveillance, although differences in rupture status between the treatment groups should be considered when interpreting these results.© 2026.

Following a prior discovery and validation studies in subjects from the United States, China, and Iran, we aimed to validate methylated DNA markers (MDMs) for ESCC detection in Malawi, a country with one of the highest ESSC incidence. Fourteen MDMs were tested on 177 tissue samples. Ten MDMs showed excellent performance (AUCs ≥0.85); a random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.97. The consistent cross-population performance suggests potential for universal application of these MDMs and further justifies exploring non-endoscopic sampling methods, such as swallowed cell collection devices in combination with MDMs, for efficient and cost-effective screening in high-incidence populations.","Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)","Jan 13, 2026",2026.0,Jan,13.0,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Calise K Berger|Gift Mulima|Tamiwe Tomoka|Shiraz Khan|Douglas W Mahoney|Paul S Albert|Christian C Abnet|Sanford M Dawsey|Yingxi Chen|John B Kisiel|Prasad G Iyer,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Calise K Berger|Douglas W Mahoney|John B Kisiel|Prasad G Iyer,"Mayo Clinic Rochester United States.|Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN United States.|Mayo Clinic United States.|Kamuzu Central Hospital Lilongwe Malawi.|University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Malawi.|National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute Bethesda, MD United States.|National Cancer Institute Rockville, MD United States.|National Cancer Institute Maryland United States.","Caroline L Matchett, Seth W Slettedahl, William R Taylor, Collin E Chalmers, Patrick H Foote, Calise K Berger, Gift Mulima, Tamiwe Tomoka, Shiraz Khan, Douglas W Mahoney, Paul S Albert, Christian C Abnet, Sanford M Dawsey, Yingxi Chen, John B Kisiel, Prasad G Iyer",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41527379/,"Esophageal cancer is a major global health concern, causing many deaths each year.

39884851,2026-01-14,Comparative efficacy and safety of stent retrievers as a bailout strategy following failed contact aspiration technique in acute stroke thrombectomy.,"The contact aspiration (CA) technique is often used to perform endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS); however, rescue strategies are necessary if CA fails to achieve recanalization. This study investigates the outcomes of incorporating stent retriever (SR) thrombectomy in the rescue strategy following failed CA.EVT patients with failed CA attempts were identified from a large multicenter registry and stratified by rescue technique: CA alone or incorporating SR in the rescue strategy. Outcomes included successful recanalization, 90-day functional outcomes (defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and 90-day mortality.Among 1885 patients with failed CA attempts, conversion to SR was associated with higher recanalization rates (85.2% vs 80.6%; p=0.03), higher rates of second-pass recanalization (31.2% vs 23.4%; p<0.001), and better 90-day outcomes (mRS 0-2: 35.2% vs 29.9%; p=0.04) when compared with repeated CA attempts. Trevo SRs showed higher odds of successful recanalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.9; p=0.02), second-pass recanalization (aOR=1.7; p=0.01), and reduced odds of sICH (aOR=0.3; p=0.02). EmboTrap SRs were associated with higher odds of 90-day mortality (aOR=2.6; p=0.004) and sICH (aOR=2.9; p=0.04) and lower odds of recanalization (aOR=0.5; p=0.03).Incorporating SR in the rescue strategy after a failed CA improves recanalization rates and functional outcomes.

We evaluate the outcomes of FDS retreatment in a large multicenter cohort.We retrospectively analyzed data from 118 patients across 22 institutions who underwent FDS retreatment for recurrent/persistent aneurysms after SAC (2008-22). The primary outcome was angiographic occlusion status at last follow-up, categorized as complete (100%), near-complete (90-99%), or incomplete (<90%) occlusion. Secondary outcomes included procedural complications and clinical outcomes measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).A total of 118 patients (median age 57, 74.6% female) with median follow-up of 15.3 months were identified. Complete occlusion was achieved in 62.5% and near-complete occlusion in 25%. FDS deployment within the pre-existing stent was successful in 98.3% of cases. Major complications occurred in 3.4% of cases, including postoperative aneurysmal rupture with resultant mortality (1.6%) and thromboembolic events with long-term disability (1.6%). Favorable clinical outcomes (mRS 0-2) were observed in 95.1% of patients. Wider aneurysm neck diameter was a significant predictor of incomplete occlusion (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.23 per mm, P=0.044), with male sex trending towards association with non-occlusion (aOR 3.2, P=0.07), while baseline hypertension was associated with complete occlusion (aOR 0.32, P=0.048).FDS treatment for recurrent/residual aneurysms after SAC represents a viable treatment option for these challenging cases with acceptable safety and reasonable occlusion rates, although lower than de novo FDS occlusion rates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

Resolution of at least one T2-lesion differentiated MOGAD from MS (sensitivity, (95% CI 77% to 100%), specificity, (95% CI 86% to 99%); Youden's index (YI)=0.90). Resolution of at least two T2-lesions indicated MOGAD (sensitivity 62% (95% CI 41% to 79%); specificity, 100% (95% CI 94% to 100%); YI=0.62). MOGAD patients were more likely to have normal MRI scans at follow-up compared with MS (brain 14/44 (32%) vs 0/60 (0%), p<0.001; spine 21/27 (78%) vs 7/36 (19%), p<0.001). In addition, the presence of T1-hypointense, ovoid periventricular T2, and enhancing lesions were more common in MS versus MOGAD at attack and remission and in the spine, longitudinally extensive T2 lesions were more common in MOGAD attacks (8/27 (30%)).Paired MRI at attack and remission revealed distinctive characteristics of MOGAD and MS, with greater diagnostic value at remission driven by the discriminating power of T2-lesion resolution. In MOGAD patients with initial parenchymal involvement, a 1-year follow-up MRI may aid diagnosis and serve as a new baseline.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026. No commercial re-use.

41052404,2026-01-14,CAR HEMATOTOX independently predicts outcomes after CD19 CAR-T therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell (CAR-T) treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induces high initial response rates, but most patients relapse. Low disease burden (often defined as <5% blasts in the bone marrow) is associated with better outcomes. CAR HEMATOTOX (HT) is a score using prelymphodepletion hematologic and inflammatory parameters to predict outcomes in lymphoma. Here, we assess its prognostic utility in a large multicenter adult B-cell ALL cohort. Patients who received brexucabtagene autoleucel across 33 centers in North America were included as part of the Real-World Outcomes Collaborative of CAR-T in Adult ALL (ROCCA) consortium. An independent cohort of 61 patients with ALL treated with an investigational CD19 CAR-T therapy at 1 center was also described. Among 199 ROCCA consortium patients, 43 (22%) patients with HTlow scores had lower rates of delayed neutrophil recovery than those with HThigh scores (26% vs 52%, P = .002) and fewer severe infections (2.5% vs 18.8%, P = .011). They also had higher response rates, overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS), as well as lower nonrelapse mortality and cumulative incidence of relapse. The survival differences remained significant after multivariable adjustment for disease burden and other covariates. In the investigational cohort of 61 patients, patients with HTlow scores had improved OS and EFS, as well as higher peak CAR-T expansion. In summary, CAR HT score is a prognostic factor independent of disease burden in adult ALL. HTlow score is associated with superior outcomes after CD19 CAR-Ts and higher CAR-T expansion in a single-center cohort.

This research study examined the impact of the timing of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, a procedure to treat an irregular heartbeat, on the recurrence of AF and clinical outcomes in patients with two different types of heart failure. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) occurs when the heart cannot fill with enough blood, while heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. The researchers compared patients who underwent AF ablation early in their disease course to those who had the procedure later. They found that patients who had the ablation earlier experienced lower rates of AF recurrence and better overall clinical outcomes, such as fewer hospitalizations, regardless of the type of heart failure. This suggests that performing AF ablation sooner rather than later may be beneficial for patients with both HFpEF and HFrEF. However, the study was limited by its retrospective design,",Cardiology,
41527836,2026-01-14,"ercc6 deficient zebrafish exhibit UV and metronidazole sensitivity, increased oxygen consumption, and impaired hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction which can be restored by the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP.","Cockayne Syndrome is an ultra-rare premature aging condition associated with UV sensitivity, neurocognitive decline, retinopathy, metronidazole-induced lethality, and sensorineural hearing loss. In 70% of affected patients, bi-allelic pathogenic variants in ERCC6 are identified. Although the role of ERCC6 in DNA damage repair has been studied, little is known about the mechanism for defective ERCC6 function in clinical findings, particularly hearing loss. To identify the mechanism of disease caused by pathogenic variants in ERCC6, we developed a zebrafish (Danio rerio) ercc6 loss of function model. We assessed survival after UV and metronidazole exposure, measured basal respiration rates, and evaluated mechanoelectrical transduction function and counts of lateral line hair cells. We found that UV exposure significantly reduces ercc6-/- larval viability. Metronidazole treatment results in complete lethality; wildtype controls show nearly complete survival. ercc6-/- embryos have significantly increased oxygen consumption, suggesting abnormal mitochondrial function. Phalloidin staining of lateral line hair cells with and without UV treatment shows no difference in hair cell counts per neuromast between treatment groups. Mechanoelectrical transduction function after UV exposure, measured by FM1-43 uptake, is reduced. Metronidazole lethality is reduced, oxygen consumption rates are restored, and mechanoelectrical transduction function is preserved by treatment with Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin Chloride (MnTBAP), a superoxide dismutase mimetic. We propose that defective mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species levels provide a mechanism for hair cell dysfunction in this model of Cockayne Syndrome. These results provide a foundation for further experiments to explore disease mechanisms and treatment modalities for this premature aging condition.© The Author(s) 2026.

Clopidogrel is widely used, but response variability related to pharmacokinetics and CYP2C19 polymorphisms may limit its effectiveness. Ticagrelor is a more potent, direct acting P2Y12 inhibitor, but its comparative effectiveness in CAS remains uncertain.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the TriNetX database, identifying adults with carotid artery stenosis who underwent CAS between January 2016 and August 2025 and received either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Primary outcomes at 180 days included ischemic stroke, major hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, and all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included inpatient readmission and emergency department (ED) visits. Propensity score matching (1:1), Kaplan-Meier survival, and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used.Among 6996 patients, 378 received ticagrelor and 6618 received clopidogrel; aspirin co-use was similar (89.7% vs 91.7%). After matching, 377 patients remained in each cohort. Ischemic stroke (2.7% vs 4.2%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.27; P=0.159) and major hemorrhage (2.9% vs 4.8%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.30; P=0.197) were numerically lower with ticagrelor. Rates of intracranial hemorrhage were similar (2.7% vs 2.7%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.53; P=0.488). Mortality was numerically higher with ticagrelor (3.4% vs 2.7%; HR 1.64, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.97; P=0.263). ED visits were similar (14.3% vs 14.6%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; P=0.895). Inpatient readmission was numerically lower with ticagrelor (15.9% vs 19.1%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14; P=0.223).Ticagrelor and clopidogrel showed comparable safety and effectiveness following CAS.

41530266,2026-01-14,Monitoring biological effects of somatic cell genome editing.,"CRISPR-based genome editing therapeutics are entering the clinic, offering transformative potential but also presenting potential risks. Preclinical-to-clinical toolkits are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of these new therapies and accelerate progress. Emerging technologies to monitor the biological effects of genome editors cover a range of biological scales, from the direct measurement of editing outcomes in DNA, to human microphysiological systems, and non-invasive in vivo imaging. Measurements of on-target and off-target editing outcomes, including sequences unique to humans, provide essential benchmarks to understand functional responses. Microphysiological systems, including organoids and organs-on-chips, enable phenotypic evaluations of editing strategies in varied organ lineages and disease states. Non-invasive imaging modalities can track the biodistribution and activities of genome editors and edited cells in vivo. Collectively, these technologies provide complementary insights across different scales, from the single nucleotide to the whole organism, bridging preclinical therapeutics development with clinical trials.© 2026.

While prior surveys have summarized their capabilities in medical imaging, a critical gap remains-the translation from research innovation to sustainable clinical radiology practice. This review directly addresses the implementation gap by presenting subspecialty-specific deployment strategies, real-world performance benchmarks from clinical settings, and practical PACS/RIS integration protocols informed by deployments across 15 healthcare systems. Rather than cataloging model architectures or theoretical advances, we focus on how radiology departments can effectively and successfully implement foundation models in practice, providing actionable, evidence-based guidance for clinical teams responsible for making adoption and deployment decisions. We explore architectures ranging from Vision Transformers to multimodal systems, their pre-training strategies, and adaptation techniques for medical imaging tasks. Clinical applications across multiple imaging modalities have demonstrated significant advances in lesion detection, disease classification, and automated reporting. Despite this progress, challenges remain in achieving robust clinical validation, navigating regulatory approval, and addressing ethical implementation. In this review, we evaluate key performance metrics and examine integration challenges, with particular attention to issues of data heterogeneity, interpretability, and computational efficiency. This review uniquely integrates an imaging informatics perspective, framing foundation models within the full lifecycle of medical imaging data from acquisition to clinical integration. We also highlight emerging solutions and outline future directions, including next-generation architectures, applications in personalized medicine, and strategies to expand accessibility in resource-constrained settings. We further highlight practical solutions for computational efficiency and accessibility, such as edge computing and model compression, vital for broader institutional adoption. This review provides clinical teams-radiologists, administrators, and imaging informatics specialists-with actionable guidance on foundation model implementation, while also serving as a reference for researchers exploring applied AI translation in radiology.© 2026.

41530530,2026-01-14,GCN5-ERK lactylation-phosphorylation loop amplifies lactate-driven cancer progression.,"The Warburg effect leads to increased lactate production and promotes cancer progression but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that lactate activates the MAPK pathway through ERK lactylation, which promotes cancer progression. We identified GCN5 as the lactyltransferase responsible for ERK lactylation. Activated ERK phosphorylates GCN5, increasing its lactyltransferase activity toward ERK and establishing a positive feedback loop that amplifies lactate-mediated cancer progression. We provide evidence that lactylation of ERK at residue K231 weakens its interaction with MEK, thereby promoting ERK dimerization and activation. We developed a cell-penetrating peptide that specifically inhibits ERK lactylation. This peptide impairs tumor growth in KRAS-mutant cancer models. Taken together, our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which lactate accelerates cancer progression through the ERK-GCN5 lactylation-phosphorylation cascade and suggest a strategy to disrupt ERK lactylation in RAS-ERK-driven cancers.© 2026.

40743447,2026-01-15,Treatment and Prevention of Injuries in Skeletally Immature Throwing Athletes.,"Increased participation in youth sports has led to a corresponding increase in throwing-related injuries among skeletally immature athletes. These injuries often stem from overuse and can in part be attributed to sport specialization leading to year-round sport participation without adequate rest and an increase in volume of practices and games during the season. Injuries that occur in skeletally immature athletes can be unique to this population due to the vulnerability of the open growth plates. Common injuries include Little League shoulder (proximal humeral epiphysiolysis), internal impingement of the shoulder, Little League elbow, medial ulnar collateral ligament injuries, and capitellar osteochondral defects. Diagnosis and management of these injuries requires a high index of suspicion from the treating physician.

41253241,2026-01-15,Prognostic Significance of Echocardiographic Transaortic Flow Rate in Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Echocardiographic evaluation of Aortic valve stenosis (AS) severity relies on aortic valve area and peak jet velocity. In pursuit of improving accuracy, the transaortic flow rate (FR), defined as the ratio of stroke volume to systolic ejection time, has been introduced. However, its prognostic value in AS patients remains a matter of controversy. This study aims to systematically review the predictive value of FR in AS patients and provide quantitative pooled analysis results where applicable. A systematic search was conducted for observational studies on AS patients published up to July 31, 2025. Studies were included if they assessed the clinical prognostic utility of FR with at least 3 months of follow-up. Pooled estimates and 95% CI for FR's hazard ratio (HR) in each binary outcome were calculated using a random effects model. Twenty-one studies with 10,895 patients underwent descriptive analysis, and 19 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. For predicting all-cause mortality, the pooled HR for low FR measured at rest (cut-off value 200-210 mL/s) was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03-1.60, I2: 66%, p < 0.05). For FR measured during stress echocardiography (cut-off value 250 mL/s), the pooled HR was higher at 1.58 (95% CI: 1.20-1.96, I2: 0%, p < 0.05). However, data in stress echocardiography have been drawn from a smaller number of studies compared to rest FR assessment, and validation in larger studies is warranted. Additionally, every 100 mL/s increase in FR, either at rest or stress, significantly reduced all-cause mortality. In Conclusion, FR is a prognostic marker for all-cause mortality and adverse composite outcomes in AS patients, indicating its potential for risk stratification. Incorporating FR into clinical assessments could help personalize follow-up and monitoring strategies.

40560837,2026-01-15,Predictors of Full-Time Spine Surgeon Faculty Position at a University Hospital.,"Although spine surgery careers are influenced by a multitude of professional and personal factors, predictors of career trajectories and future research effect may be identifiable at the spine fellow applicant stage. As such, this study aimed to (1) determine factors predictive of University Hospital [UH] employment and research contributions and (2) compare the application metrics identified as most important to an academic career by spine surgery program directors (PD) to those predictive of career environments from prior spine fellows applications.All applications of individuals applying for spine fellowship training between 2017 and 2021 at an academic institution were reviewed. Application metrics pertaining to research achievement, academic achievement, prior and current education, extracurricular involvement, leadership, examination scores, applicant interests, and letter of recommendation (LOR) reputation were extracted. The careers of all prior spine fellow applicants were grouped by the presence or absence of full-time university appointment and research effect (current H-index). A survey sent to spine PDs asked them to rank the importance of application factors to academic careers using analogous metrics to the application review.A total of 310 applications were reviewed. Residency publications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.09, P = 0.0116), preclinical publications (OR: 1.24, P = 0.0447), and expressed academic interest (OR: 2.25, P = 0.0229) predicted UH appointment. Applicant physician scientist interest (β: 2.41, P < 0.001), LOR writers' reputation (β: 0.05, P < 0.001), and journal reviewer positions (β: 0.80, P < 0.001) predicted current H-index. In the PDs survey, metrics predicting academic trajectory were ranked (descending): research achievements, physician scientist interest, academic interest, leadership positions, LOR writers' reputation, prestige of training, and United States Medical Licensing Examination scores. Research year(s), advanced degrees, and society leadership and membership positions, although theoretically deemed important by PDs, were in actuality minor contributors to the career environments of spine fellow applicants.Spine fellow academic interest, residency publications, and preclinical publications predicted full-time UH-based careers.3.Retrospective Cohort Analysis.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Jan 15, 2026",2026.0,Jan,15.0,Hannah A Levy|Payton Boere|John Paulik|John Bodnar|Nicholas D D'Antonio|Bradford L Currier|Paul M Huddleston|Ahmad N Nassr|Brett A Freedman|Arjun S Sebastian|Darrel S Brodke|Alan S Hilibrand|Brian A Karamian,Hannah A Levy,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Levy, Currier, Huddleston, Nassr, Freedman, and Sebastian), the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rothman Institute at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA (Boere, Paulik, Bodnar, D'Antonio, and Hilibrand), and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (Brodke and Karamian).","Hannah A Levy, Payton Boere, John Paulik, John Bodnar, Nicholas D D'Antonio, Bradford L Currier, Paul M Huddleston, Ahmad N Nassr, Brett A Freedman, Arjun S Sebastian, Darrel S Brodke, Alan S Hilibrand, Brian A Karamian",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40560837/,"This research study aimed to identify factors that predict whether spine surgery fellows will go on to have a full-time faculty position at a university hospital.

40652981,2026-01-15,Considerations in the development of learning health networks for mood disorders.,"Learning Health Networks (LHNs), such as the one described in Savitz et al. (in press), involve employing a network of treatment centers to produce standardized data from routine clinical practice, produce knowledge from that data, and systematically use that knowledge to inform care. To date, there are limited examples of LHNs in psychiatry. It is essential to establish robust dialogue around best practices for building LHNs to advance precision medicine in psychiatry.A task group consensus on key elements of LHNs as applied to mood disorders was convened. Task group members reviewed current literature and ongoing LHN network efforts and evaluated opportunities and gaps within psychiatry broadly, and mood disorders specifically.Task group members noted four key considerations for building LHNs for mood disorders. First, obtain qualitative and quantitative stakeholder input at every stage of development, specifically input from patients and patients' families, clinicians and health system leadership. Second, collect data on objective measures of functioning, such as neuropsychological testing, quality of life indicators, and blood-based markers of health, alongside more standard measures such as symptom severity. Third, carefully consider the details of how new evidence-based practices will be identified and implemented. Fourth, identify a plan for sustainability.Literature was reviewed and discussed among expert task group members, but this was not a systematic review.With stakeholder input, data on functioning as well as symptom severity, thoughtful implementation strategies, and an eye to sustainability, LHNs represent an important opportunity for advancement in the treatment of mood disorders.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers reviewed current literature and ongoing LHN efforts, and identified four main areas to focus on. First, it's crucial to get input from patients, families, clinicians, and healthcare leaders at every stage of development. Second, LHNs should collect data not just on symptom severity, but also on things like quality of life and biological markers of health. Third, the process of identifying and implementing new evidence-based practices needs to be carefully planned.

40499047,2026-01-15,Patient-Reported Outcome Measures After Direct Anterior Total Hip Arthroplasty Are Comparable Between Patients With Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip and Osteoarthritis: A Propensity-Matched Analysis.,"Degenerative changes secondary to hip dysplasia may be treated with total hip arthroplasty (THA) through a direct anterior approach. However, this may be challenging due to altered pathoanatomy and difficult visualization of the femur. The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcome measures between patients with hip dysplasia and matched controls with osteoarthritis who underwent direct anterior THA.Patients who underwent direct anterior THA were retrospectively reviewed. Dysplastic hips were propensity matched to hips with osteoarthritis on a 1:4 basis. Patient-reported outcome measures, including visual analog scale pain at rest and with use, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain, and Forgotten Joint Score-12, were obtained at follow-up. In addition, modified Harris Hip scores (mHHS) were obtained both preoperatively and at the final follow-up.Thirty-eight hips with dysplasia and 152 control hips were followed for a mean of 5.1 ± 2.8 years. Eighty-seven percent of the dysplastic hips had Grade I hip dysplasia based on the Crowe classification, whereas 5.3% had Grade II, 2.6% had Grade III, and 5.3% had Grade IV. Both cohorts demonstrated notable preoperative to postoperative improvements in mHHS ( P < 0.001). No differences were observed at the final follow-up between the dysplasia and osteoarthritis cohorts for VAS at rest (0.5 vs. 0.5, P = 0.828), visual analog scale with use (0.7 vs. 1.1, P = 0.231), Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain (93.8 vs. 92.3, P = 0.518), Forgotten Joint Score-12 (82.2 vs. 81.4, P = 0.856), and mHHS (91.9 vs. 91.4, P = 0.793). Revision rates were comparable between the dysplasia and osteoarthritis cohorts (5.3% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.179).Patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis who underwent direct anterior THA achieved comparable outcomes in this propensity-matched analysis. Patients with hip dysplasia can expect reduced pain, improved functional outcomes, and similar revision surgery rates to those with osteoarthritis following primary THA.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Jan 15, 2026",2026.0,Jan,15.0,Sean C Clark|Breydan H Wright|Aliya G Feroe|Cory G Couch|Michael J Taunton|Mario Hevesi,Sean C Clark,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Sean C Clark, Breydan H Wright, Aliya G Feroe, Cory G Couch, Michael J Taunton, Mario Hevesi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40499047/,"This study compared the outcomes of total hip replacement surgery between two groups of patients - those with a condition called hip dysplasia, and those with osteoarthritis of the hip.

40758987,2026-01-15,Drivers of Delayed Time to Surgery for Hip Fracture Patients: A Multi-Center Qualitative Study.,"Delays in time to surgery (TTS) for patients with a hip fracture negatively affect patient outcomes, including mortality. Surgery within 24 to 48 hours of admission for a hip fracture markedly reduces these risks; however, attempts at improving TTS after hip fracture have had mixed results. Drivers of delays in TTS across different settings in the United States are not well described. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify drivers of delays in TTS for patients with a hip fracture from different settings to inform where patient- and context-specific improvements in TTS may be implemented.Semistructured interviews were completed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Theoretical Domains Framework. Interviews were completed with stakeholders involved in hip fracture care between June 2023 and October 2023. Transcripts were analyzed iteratively through a combined inductive and deductive approach. The data were analyzed to synthesize overarching themes related to drivers of delays of TTS.A total of 25 stakeholders, 24 orthopaedic surgeons, and 1 nurse practitioner, from 22 different hospital systems across the United States participated in semistructured interviews. Eight themes of drivers of delayed TTS emerged: (1) patient health; (2) structural drivers of health; (3) care coordination; (4) prioritization; (5) improvement climate; (6) availability; (7) incentive structure; and (8) empowerment.Eight major themes related to drivers in TTS for patients with a hip fracture were identified across hospital systems. These findings inform the process of identifying site-specific drivers of delayed TTS at individual health systems and implementing targeted improvement programs for TTS for patients with a hip fracture.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Jan 15, 2026",2026.0,Jan,15.0,Emily A Schultz|Jessica M Welch|William Cross|Kalpit Shah|P K Mansuripur|Michael Kain|Pamela Holte|Byung J Lee|Matthew Burn|Kimberly Hall|Michael Willey|Michael McKee|Eric Pang|Malcolm DeBaun|Nathan Douglass|Kenneth Egol|David Laverty|Anna N Miller|Kyle Jeray|Mara Schenker|Lisa K Cannada|Giselle Hernandez|Samir Mehta|Rosanna Wustrack|Allison Mitchell|Saam Morshed|Michael Gardner|Arden Morris|Laurence Baker|Lauren M Shapiro|Alex Sox-Harris|Robin N Kamal,Emily A Schultz,"From the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA (Schultz, Gardner, and Kamal), the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC (Welch and DeBaun), the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

41072875,2026-01-15,Acid accumulation in bipolar disorder.,"Acid accumulation (AA) describes the continuum of hydrogen ions concentration in the body reflected by increased acid-base buffer activity manifested by low bicarbonate (HCO3) concentration, increased anion gap (AG) or corrected AG (CAG). AA is associated with dietary acid-load, mitochondrial dysfunction, alcohol-abuse, obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and kidney disease. Despite these factors being highly prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) AA has not been studied in this population. In this study we assessed AA in persons with BD and compared them primarily to controls and secondarily to individuals with BD and alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Available electronic health record data was analyzed from persons with BD (n = 733) enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank, controls (n = 548) and BD inpatients with AWS (BD + AWS, n = 399). AA analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and eGFR. Compared to controls, persons with BD had lower HCO3, higher AG, and higher CAG - thus greater acid accumulation. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and eGFR we still observed higher AG (10.8 vs 10.1 mEq/L, p = 0.006) and CAG (11.7 vs 10.4 mEq/L, p < 0.001) in BD. In a secondary analysis considering BD + AWS and excluding persons with alcohol use disorder in the other groups, persons with BD + AWS had significantly higher AA than both persons with BD and controls (all p < 0.001). We found greater AA in persons with BD, and this was accentuated in BD + AWS. Future studies may focus on the risk factors of AA in BD to personalize prevention strategies.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers analyzed medical records from over 1,700 people, including those with bipolar disorder, those with bipolar disorder and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and healthy control participants. They found that people with bipolar disorder tended to have higher levels of acid accumulation, as indicated by lower bicarbonate levels and higher anion gap measurements in their blood tests. This acid buildup was even more pronounced in those with bipolar disorder who were also experiencing alcohol withdrawal.

These findings suggest that acid accumulation may be an important factor to consider in bipolar disorder, as it could contribute to or exacerbate the symptoms of this condition. Further research",Psychiatry,
41110682,2026-01-15,Impact of a single packed red blood cell unit on recipient phosphatidylethanol.,"Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a marker of alcohol consumption present on erythrocytes. Consensus guidelines suggest that PEth concentrations ≥20 ng/mL and ≥ 200 ng/mL are consistent with alcohol consumption or chronic excessive consumption, respectively. However, packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion is a potential source of PEth in transfusion recipients. Currently, the prevalence of this phenomenon and the magnitude of PEth elevation after transfusion of a single pRBC unit remain uncertain. This study evaluated the impact of single-unit pRBC transfusion on observed PEth concentrations in recipients. The 16:0/18:1 homologue of PEth was measured in pre-transfusion, post-transfusion, and pRBC samples using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry with lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) 10 ng/mL. In 99 consecutively-enrolled recipients, pRBC transfusion was responsible for 60.9 % of post-transfusion PEth concentrations ≥LLOQ and 60.0 % of post-transfusion concentrations ≥20 ng/mL. In the full study population (n = 143), 56 recipients had pre-transfusion PEth <LLOQ and received a PEth-positive pRBC unit. Of these, 26 (46.4 %) and 11 (19.6 %) had post-transfusion PEth ≥LLOQ and ≥ 20 ng/mL, respectively; the highest post-transfusion PEth in this group was 83.4 ng/mL. In recipients with pre-transfusion PEth ≥LLOQ (n = 36), clinical interpretation changed for 5 individuals whose post-transfusion PEth concentrations decreased below interpretive thresholds (LLOQ, 20 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL) and for 2 other recipients whose concentrations increased above interpretive thresholds. These findings indicate the prevalence and magnitude of impact of pRBC transfusion are likely greater than previously recognized, and even one pRBC unit can meaningfully increase or decrease post-transfusion PEth.Copyright © 2025.

41144907,2026-01-15,New Clues to the Challenge of Knee Arthrofibrosis: From Molecules to Therapies.,"Knee arthrofibrosis (AF) is a debilitating complication after total knee arthroplasty. AF is characterized by formation of fibrotic adhesions, loss of joint mobility, and pain. With osteoarthritis prevalence and associated total knee arthroplasties projected to rise sharply, AF is becoming increasingly prevalent, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood and no effective treatments exist. Like other fibrotic diseases, knee AF is a multifactorial disease that exhibits TGFβ1-driven myofibroblast transformation and excessive collagen deposition. However, knee AF also displays unique features, including rapid disease development and the establishment of a highly fibrotic mass rather than fibrotic tissue infiltration. Our integrative research approach uses human patient fibroblasts, multiomics profiling, and in vivo animal models to dissect disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Our work suggests altered adipogenic cell differentiation in the knee and epigenetic pathways controlling myofibroblastogenesis to be involved in AF development. Anti-inflammatory interventions with ketotifen and celecoxib reduce knee AF in vivo, indicating a contributory role of inflammation as well. Together, our novel findings elucidate causal and mechanistic drivers of AF and define this disease as an adipose-depleted fibrotic disorder driven by aberrant differentiation and epigenetic regulation, suggesting new therapeutic avenues for intervention.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Jan 15, 2026",2026.0,Jan,15.0,Roman Thaler|Ashley N Payne|Daniel J Berry|Matthew P Abdel,Roman Thaler,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Roman Thaler, Ashley N Payne, Daniel J Berry, Matthew P Abdel",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144907/,"Knee arthrofibrosis is a serious complication that can occur after knee replacement surgery, causing pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility.

Observational data suggest endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor papillotomy reduces the risk of pancreatitis episodes. Even though this endoscopic procedure is widely used in practice, clinical trials are lacking.To determine whether ERCP with minor papillotomy reduces the risk of acute pancreatitis among adults with unexplained acute recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum.This multicenter, sham-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled adults with 2 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Adults with other etiologies for acute pancreatitis or concomitant chronic calcific pancreatitis were excluded. The trial was conducted between September 1, 2018, and August 30, 2024, at 21 referral centers in the US and Canada. Last follow-up occurred on February 15, 2025.Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ERCP with minor papillotomy or sham ERCP.The primary outcome was development of acute pancreatitis more than 30 days after randomization as a time-to-event outcome. The secondary outcomes included acute pancreatitis episode frequency and development of chronic calcific pancreatitis, diabetes, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.A total of 148 participants were randomized (mean age, 54 [SD, 19.5] years; 68.2% female; 95.3% non-Hispanic or Latino and 87.2% White; mean lifetime acute pancreatitis episodes, 3 [SD, 2]; mean duct diameter, 2.2 [SD, 1.3] mm) and followed up for a median of 34 months (IQR, 21.7-45.7 months). Of the 75 participants in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group, 26 (34.7%) developed acute pancreatitis compared with 32 of 73 participants (43.8%) in the sham ERCP group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.41]). The incidence rate ratio for acute recurrent pancreatitis episode frequency was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.34) in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group vs 0.30 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.41) in the sham ERCP group. There were no between-group differences in frequency and incidence of chronic calcific pancreatitis (4.0% in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group vs 2.7% in the sham ERCP group; risk difference [RD], 0.01 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.07]), diabetes (15.8% vs 12.8%, respectively; RD, 0.03 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.19]), and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (7.7% vs 17.2%; RD, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.08]). The adverse event of acute pancreatitis within 30 days of randomization occurred more frequently in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group (14.7%) vs the sham ERCP group (8.2%) (RD, 0.06 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.17]).Among patients with unexplained acute recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum, ERCP with minor papillotomy does not reduce the risk of another episode of acute pancreatitis or related sequelae.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03609944.",JAMA,"Jan 14, 2026",2026.0,Jan,14.0,Gregory A Coté|Valerie Durkalski-Mauldin|Evan L Fogel|Dana C Moffatt|Andrew Y Wang|Luis F Lara|Paul R Tarnasky|James L Buxbaum|Sun-Chuan C Dai|Sreeni Jonnalagadda|Field F Willingham|Andrew Ross|Rajesh N Keswani|Sumant Inamdar|Truptesh H Kothari|Timothy B Gardner|Priya A Jamidar|Srinivas Gaddam|Douglas K Pleskow|Jeffrey J Easler|B J Elmunzer|John G Coneys|J S Mallery|Daniel S Strand|Georgios I Papachristou|Adam Slivka|Prashant Kedia|Ara B Sahakian|Abdul Kouanda|Anh Phan|April Williams|Dana K Andersen|Jose Serrano|Dhiraj Yadav,Truptesh H Kothari,"Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.|Department of Public Health, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.|Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis.|Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.|Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville.|Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus.|Methodist Dallas Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.|Department of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.|Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.|Saint Luke's GI Specialists, St Luke's Hospital of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.|Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington.|Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Arkansas, Little Rock.|Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.|Department of Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Lebanon, New Hampshire.|Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.|Department of Medicine, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.|Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.|Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.|Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland.","Gregory A Coté, Valerie Durkalski-Mauldin, Evan L Fogel, Dana C Moffatt, Andrew Y Wang, Luis F Lara, Paul R Tarnasky, James L Buxbaum, Sun-Chuan C Dai, Sreeni Jonnalagadda, Field F Willingham, Andrew Ross, Rajesh N Keswani, Sumant Inamdar, Truptesh H Kothari, Timothy B Gardner, Priya A Jamidar, Srinivas Gaddam, Douglas K Pleskow, Jeffrey J Easler, B J Elmunzer, John G Coneys, J S Mallery, Daniel S Strand, Georgios I Papachristou, Adam Slivka, Prashant Kedia, Ara B Sahakian, Abdul Kouanda, Anh Phan, April Williams, Dana K Andersen, Jose Serrano, Dhiraj Yadav",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41533371/,"This study examined whether a common medical procedure could help reduce recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, a painful and potentially serious condition affecting the pancreas.

Subspecialties (e.g., retina, optometry, oculoplastic, etc.) were assigned based on company websites. Data collection included primary practice locations, last financing dates, and any satellite practices linked to acquired companies. Statistical analysis including linear regression and analysis of variance for comparison of variables was performed to assess acquisition trends, subspecialty distribution, and geographic expansion patterns with a significance level of a P value < 0.05.Annual acquisition counts, urban vs. rural classification, and subspecialty coverage.Between 2011 and 2024, 85% of all PE acquisitions targeted urban practices, and acquisitions grew markedly from 2016 to 2021 before peaking in 2021. After that peak, acquisitions declined from 71 in 2022 to 27 in 2024; 96% of the 2022-2024 acquisitions were urban. Geographic analysis showed the Southern region received the highest proportion of recent acquisitions (50%) during 2022-2024, while the Midwest, West, and Northeast received 16%, 19%, and 15% respectively (P = 0.19). Subspecialty distribution indicated that retina, oculoplastic, cataract, and optometry services were most offered by acquired practices, particularly in urban areas. Satellite expansions further demonstrated a strong urban focus, resulting in a threefold higher number of urban satellites compared with rural ones (P = 0.03).Private equity activity continues to favor urban, subspecialty-rich practices, while rural investments remain limited. As overall deal volume has declined since 2021-likely influenced by rising interest rates and pandemic-related economic factors-further research is needed to clarify how PE ownership affects care quality, patient outcomes, and practice sustainability.

41532836,2026-01-15,Agentic AI in Radiology: Evolution from Large Language Models to Future Clinical Integration.,"The introduction of foundational models, specifically large language models, has promised a health care transformation. However, the field is rapidly evolving toward autonomous agent systems, defined as AI entities that perceive and react to their environment to achieve specific goals-representing a paradigm shift from passive information retrieval to proactive, goal-oriented clinical assistance. Agentic AI systems transcend static knowledge limitations through core capabilities including persistent memory systems that maintain context across patient encounters, knowledge retrieval tools connecting to medical repositories through retrieval-augmented generation techniques, and computer use functionality enabling navigation of clinical software interfaces. Agentic workflows introduce sophisticated coordination mechanisms including hierarchical, collaborative, and sequential patterns demonstrating superior performance compared with single-agent approaches. Multiagent systems can autonomously coordinate entire clinical workflows across the entire radiology lifecycle, from preacquisition protocol optimization through initial image analysis, specialized tool deployment, and preliminary report generation. However, successful clinical deployment requires systematic consideration of complexity thresholds, economic sustainability, cybersecurity frameworks, bias mitigation strategies, and appropriate governance structures. Critical challenges include managing the probabilistic nature of underlying models within deterministic clinical workflows, ensuring adequate human supervision, and preventing overcomplication of established processes. A structured four-phase implementation roadmap addresses these considerations through incremental progression from low-risk automation to comprehensive workflow orchestration while maintaining rigorous safety standards. As foundation models advance and interoperability standards mature, agentic AI will reshape radiology practice paradigms. Success depends on resolving stakeholder responsibility questions while orchestrating technological capabilities with clinical accountability, ensuring autonomous systems augment rather than replace professional judgment in pursuit of improved patient outcomes. ©RSNA, 2026.",Radiology.

No externally validated score currently predicts procedural risk to guide treatment decisions. We developed and validated 2 predictive scores for complications after endovascular treatment (EVT) or neurosurgical treatment (NT) of UIA using routinely collected clinical and aneurysmal features.We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including patients with UIA treated with EVT or NT across 15 neurovascular centers (2014-2024). Predictive models were built using multivariable logistic regression, with variables derived from Delphi consensus. The primary outcome was a composite safety end point: new neurological deficits, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) worsening (≥1 point or mRS 2-5 within 30 days), or procedural death. Internal validation used bootstrapping, and external validation was performed temporally and institutionally. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and calibration. Final scores, named Morbidity and Mortality Associated Risk in the Treatment of UIAs (MARTA)-EVT and MARTA-NT, were compared with existing models identified through systematic review.Among 2647 patients (1907 EVT and 740 NT), procedural complications occurred in 6.3% (EVT) and 12.8% (NT). Independent predictors included age, baseline mRS, aneurysm location, size, morphology, and procedural factors. MARTA-EVT (AUROC = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.57-0.78) and MARTA-NT (AUROC = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.54-0.77) showed moderate discrimination and good calibration. MARTA-EVT outperformed existing models; MARTA-NT performed similarly to SAFETEA. Predictive models are available open-source: https://martascoreapp.shinyapps.io/martascoreapp/.MARTA-EVT and MARTA-NT are validated tools for predicting procedural risks in UIA treatment and may support patient counseling and clinical decision making.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2026.

This study compared self-reported speech function between patients surgically treated for OCC and healthy controls using the Speech Handicap Index (SHI) and identified factors associated with worse scores.This is a multiinstitutional cross-sectional study of OCC patients and healthy controls recruited between July 2024 and March 2025. Participants completed the SHI and self-reported speech quality. Demographics, tumor, and treatment details were abstracted from the electronic health record for OCC. Group differences were assessed with t-tests, χ2, and Fisher's exact tests.Among 69 OCC and 90 controls, OCC patients had significantly higher mean SHI scores (50.2 vs. 34.7, p < 0.01) and were less likely to rate their speech as ""good"" or ""excellent"" (47.8% vs. 85.6%, p < 0.01). Both speech and psychosocial domain scores were significantly worse among OCC. Free flap reconstruction was associated with worse scores (29.6 vs. 15.5, p = 0.02) and worse self-rated speech quality.Patients with surgically treated oral cavity cancer have significantly impaired self-perceived speech and psychosocial functioning compared with healthy individuals. Greater deficits were observed in patients who required free flap reconstruction. Despite the functional deficit, nearly half of OCC patients reported satisfaction with their speech quality.

The goal of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of the hepatic response criteria. AL patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 with liver involvement [serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) >1.5 upper reference limit (URL)] who achieved hematological response were included. Hepatic response was defined as >50% reduction (or normalization) of AP from baseline. Hepatic response was assessed at 6, 12, and 24-months after therapy initiation and at best response. Overall survival (OS) was assessed from time of therapy initiation. Hepatic response was evaluated in 116 patients. The median baseline serum AP was X2.6 URL. Hematological very good partial response (VGPR) or better was achieved in 69% of patients. AP decreased with time, with a median reduction of 22%, 34%, and 53% at 6-, 12-, and 24-months, respectively, and a median AP reduction of 56% at the time of best response. The median time to hepatic response was 13.3 months and was longer for patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. Achievement of hepatic response, particularly as early as 12 months, and at best response, was associated with improved survival, independent of other prognostic factors.

This study aimed to identify the key barriers that prevent physician assistant (PA) training programs from implementing and maintaining student mentorship pathways. The researchers surveyed over 300 PA programs across the United States to understand the challenges they face. They found that the biggest barriers were a lack of time for faculty to serve as mentors, difficulty securing enough qualified mentors, and a general lack of clear guidance on how to structure effective mentorship programs. These barriers were present both in establishing new mentorship initiatives and in sustaining existing ones. Addressing these challenges is important because strong mentorship can help PA students develop the skills and confidence they need to provide high-quality patient care. However, the study was limited by a relatively low response rate, so more research may be needed to fully understand the scope of the problem. Overall, this work highlights the",Gastroenterology,
41535726,2026-01-16,Comparison of Diagnostic Imaging Patterns Between Pediatric and Adult Trained Physicians in Adolescent Trauma Activations.,"The aim of this study was to investigate differences in utilization of diagnostic imaging between the adult and pediatric trauma teams when caring for adolescent trauma patients.This was a retrospective observational study from 2015 to 2019 comparing pediatric trauma team activations for patients ages 12 to 14 and adult trauma team activations for patients ages 15 to 17 at a single institution verified as both a level I adult and a level I pediatric trauma center. Data were collected from a prospective trauma registry and manual chart review of the electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the frequency of whole body computed tomography (WBCT) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of individual body regions.We identified 191 adult and 100 pediatric trauma team cases, with similar proportions transferred from outside hospitals (40% vs. 43%). Among patients presenting directly from the scene, WBCT use was significantly higher in the adult trauma team group (64% vs. 12%; RR: 5.21; 95% CI: 2.57-10.58), as was CT of all individual body regions. For transferred patients, the adult trauma team more often performed WBCT and individual CT scans, excluding head CT. CT imaging rates before transfer did not differ between groups. No significant differences were observed in injury severity scores, altered mental status, length of stay, or missed injuries.Among adolescents with similar injury severity, the adult trauma team more frequently utilizes WBCT and regional CT than the pediatric team.

The study included patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mechanically ventilated in the medical ICU. We identified nursing knowledge of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scoring and identification of appropriate times for ventilator titration as key factors for intervention. We implemented educational interventions including structured in-person and self-study materials, embedded educational posters, and follow-up assessments to assess learning outcomes. Post-intervention patient data were assessed after the interventions.Mechanical ventilation duration decreased from 173 to 126 h, resulting in a 27% nominal reduction and meeting our pre-specified target.

Whether adding revascularization to intensive medical management would provide greater benefit than intensive medical management alone is unclear.We conducted two parallel, observer-blinded clinical trials that enrolled patients with high-grade (≥70%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis across 155 centers in five countries. The stenting trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid-artery stenting plus intensive medical management (stenting group); the endarterectomy trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid endarterectomy plus intensive medical management (endarterectomy group). The primary outcome was a composite of any stroke or death, assessed from randomization to 44 days, or ipsilateral ischemic stroke, assessed during the remaining follow-up period up to 4 years.A total of 1245 patients underwent randomization in the stenting trial and 1240 in the endarterectomy trial. In the stenting trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 to 8.3) in the medical-therapy group and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.3) in the stenting group (P = 0.02 for the absolute difference). In the endarterectomy trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.3 to 7.4) in the medical-therapy group and 3.7% (95% CI, 2.1 to 5.5) in the endarterectomy group (P = 0.24 for the absolute difference). From day 0 to 44, in the stenting trial, no strokes or deaths occurred in the medical-therapy group and seven strokes and one death occurred in the stenting group; in the endarterectomy trial, three strokes occurred in the medical-therapy group and nine strokes occurred in the endarterectomy group.Among patients with high-grade stenosis without recent symptoms, the addition of stenting led to a lower risk of a composite of perioperative stroke or death or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years than intensive medical management alone. Carotid endarterectomy did not lead to a significant benefit.

40997297,2026-01-16,PROs vs clinician-reported adverse events in a large clinical trial: findings from the phase 3 POLARIX study.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) poses a challenge in hematology given its varied symptoms, and the complex interplay between disease and treatment effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The phase 3 POLARIX study demonstrated superior progression-free survival and a similar safety profile with polatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (Pola-R-CHP) vs R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) in patients with previously untreated DLBCL. Here, we evaluate HRQoL through patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments to fully characterize the patient experience in the POLARIX study. Changes from baseline in HRQoL, lymphoma symptoms, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were assessed, as well as incidence and severity of common symptoms by PROs vs clinician-reported adverse events (AEs). Baseline characteristics of PRO-evaluable patients (N = 874) were consistent. Comparison between PROs and clinician-reported AEs revealed a notable discordance; patients generally reported a higher incidence of symptoms than clinicians, emphasizing the need for patient-centric tools to accurately capture the patient experience. Both treatments exhibited rapid and sustained improvements in HRQoL and lymphoma symptoms, with the most substantial improvements seen in global health status/QoL, lymphoma symptoms, fatigue, role, emotional, and social functioning. GI symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting) were generally similar between treatment arms and returned to baseline levels after treatment completion. These HRQoL data underscore the complementarity of PROs, as an adjunct to clinician-reported AEs, in evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of new treatments, including Pola-R-CHP, which may represent a new benchmark for patient-reported HRQoL in previously untreated DLBCL.

Loss of NF2 and CDKN2A/CDKN2B is common in higher-grade meningiomas and promotes progression in preclinical models. We evaluated the efficacy of abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, as one arm of the Alliance umbrella trial A071401, a genomically driven phase 2 study in recurrent and progressive meningiomas. Eligible patients with grade 2 or 3 tumors and NF2 mutations or CDK pathway alterations were treated with abemaciclib. Two co-primary endpoints were used: progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6) and response rate as defined by local review; the trial would be declared positive if either endpoint was met. The success threshold for PFS6 was 8 or more of 24 patients; for the response rate, it was 3 or more of 24 patients. Ninety-six patients were screened and 36 patients received treatment. The mean number of treatment cycles was nine and the median follow-up was 21 months. The first 24 patients who met the eligibility criteria and began treatment could be evaluated for the primary endpoint. The observed PFS6 rate was 58% (14 of 24 patients, 95% confidence interval = 37-78%), thus meeting the PFS6 criteria for promising activity. The best response was stable disease in 16 of 24 patients. Of the 36 patients who started treatment, nine had a grade 3 and two had grade 4 adverse events at least possibly related to treatment. Grade 4 toxicities included alanine aminotransferase elevation (1), aspartate aminotransferase elevation (1) and vomiting (1). The trial met its primary endpoint. Abemaciclib was well tolerated and resulted in improved PFS6.

41545398,2026-01-17,Widespread macrolide resistance among rapidly growing mycobacteria due to plasmids containing erm(55).,"Macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) are a mainstay of therapy for infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). Historically, macrolide resistance in RGM species is associated with mutations in the 23S rRNA gene and chromosomal erythromycin ribosome methylase (erm) genes. We recently described macrolide resistance in the RGM species, Mycobacterium chelonae, due to a novel, plasmid-encoded erm(55) gene. For this study, we expanded our search to pigmented RGM species. Clinical isolates from two U.S. reference laboratories were screened. Isolates were collected between 1997 and 2024 from diverse clinical sites and multiple geographic locales. Here, we describe the genetic diversity of 30 erm(55)-containing plasmids from six different RGM species. The plasmids share a common 126 kb backbone but, due to insertions and deletions, vary in size from 119 to 173 kb. Six plasmids carry heavy metal resistance operons in addition to erm(55). These results imply that erm(55)-containing plasmids are highly promiscuous, conjugative, and have been spreading unnoticed for decades.

Data regarding secondhand smoking, or passive smoking (PS) exposure, are lacking. We therefore aimed to assess the impact of PS exposure across the pancreatitis spectrum.We analyzed baseline data from the PROCEED study, a multicenter study in the US including patients with acute (AP), recurrent acute (RAP), and chronic (CP) pancreatitis. Participants detailed their individual smoking history and PS exposure, which was compared between AP, RAP, and CP subgroups. Participant factors and clinical characteristics were compared by level of individual and PS exposure.Among 1369 participants (190 AP, 498 RAP, 681 CP), 346 (25.3%) were current and 409 (29.9%) were former smokers. The CP subgroup had the highest proportion of current smokers (36.7% CP vs. 15.1% RAP, 11.1% AP, P<0.001). PS exposure was also significantly higher in the CP subgroup (68.6% CP vs. 58.2% RAP, 55.3% AP, P<0.001). A minority (16.3%) with CP reported no smoking exposure (by self or passive) while nearly half smoked ≥20 pack-years. The mean PS duration was significantly higher in CP participants (21.8 y) compared to those with AP (17.8 y) or RAP (18.9 y) (P<0.0166).In this multicenter study, we affirmed an association with smoking use and intensity with CP-related complications. For the first time we report a high prevalence of prior exposure to passive smoking in all pancreatitis subtypes, which require further study to understand the impact on disease outcomes.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41543249,2026-01-17,Genomic signatures in Variovorax enabling colonization of the Populus endosphere.,"Microbial colonization of plant roots involves strong selective pressures that shape the structure and function of root-associated communities. In particular, the endosphere represents a highly selective environment requiring host entry and in planta persistence. However, strain-specific microbial traits that enable endosphere colonization remain poorly understood. Here, we use a defined, genome-resolved community of 28 Variovorax strains isolated from the roots of Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa (poplar trees) to determine which strains partition between rhizosphere and endosphere compartments and to identify the genomic traits associated with endosphere specialization. By combining strain-resolved metagenomic profiling, comparative genomics, and functional assays, we demonstrate that dominant endosphere colonizers are enriched in genes related to nutrient metabolism, redox balance, transcriptional regulation, and a conserved L-fucose utilization pathway experimentally shown to enhance root colonization. Not all strains succeed through the same strategy. Community-wide functional profiling revealed a distinct and reduced set of traits in the endosphere, including orthogroups associated with low-abundance strains that were overlooked in strain-level analyses. These findings reveal that multiple ecological strategies, such as metabolic competition, regulatory adaptation, and niche specialization, can support endosphere colonization. Our results advance the understanding of how bacterial colonization traits are distributed and deployed within a plant microbiome and suggest that host filtering selects for distinct, and sometimes complementary, microbial strategies. This work supports a shift toward mechanistic, genome-resolved models of microbiome assembly and offers a framework for linking microbial function to host colonization success.IMPORTANCEPlants often depend on diverse microbial partners to support their growth, resilience, and adaptation to changing environments. Among these microbes, some bacteria inhabit the rhizosphere (the narrow zone around roots where microbes interact with the plant) while others are able to enter and persist within root tissues. The traits that distinguish these two lifestyles remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined a group of related Variovorax strains from poplar tree root microbiomes to ask why some rhizosphere-associated strains also become successful endosphere colonizers. We found that strains appear to succeed through different strategies: some may benefit from rapid growth on plant-derived carbon sources, while others may rely on stress tolerance or fine-tuned regulation. These results suggest that there is no single path from the rhizosphere into the root interior, but rather multiple strategies shaped by the host environment. Understanding this diversity can inform efforts to design resilient plant-microbe communities.",mSystems,"Jan 16, 2026",2026.0,Jan,16.0,Delaney G Beals|Dana L Carper|Leah H Hochanadel|Sara S Jawdy|Dawn M Klingeman|Bryan T Piatkowski|David J Weston|Mitchel J Doktycz|Dale A Pelletier,Bryan T Piatkowski,"Biosciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Delaney G Beals, Dana L Carper, Leah H Hochanadel, Sara S Jawdy, Dawn M Klingeman, Bryan T Piatkowski, David J Weston, Mitchel J Doktycz, Dale A Pelletier",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41543249/,"This research explores how certain bacteria are able to successfully colonize the internal tissues of plant roots, known as the endosphere.

Here, we demonstrate that androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) plus irradiation (IR) triggered robust anticancer immunity in prostate cancers in both patients and mice. We show that androgen-activated AR suppressed innate immune signaling by inducing inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE) gene repression through HDAC2 interaction with an IKBKE enhancer RNA (IKBKE eRNA, or IKBKE-e). ARPI treatment caused IKBKE derepression and enhanced an IR-induced innate immune response via action of RIG-I and MDA5 dsRNA sensors. IKBKE-e ablation largely enhanced innate immunity in prostate cancer cells in culture and anticancer immunity in mice. Our results revealed AR, HDAC2, and IKBKE eRNA as critical intrinsic immune suppressors in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that rejuvenating inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε) signaling by targeting IKBKE-e is an actionable strategy to elicit synthetic anticancer immunity in immunologically ""cold"" cancers such as prostate cancer.",The Journal of clinical investigation,"Jan 16, 2026",2026.0,Jan,16.0,Xiang Li|Rui Sun|Hao Li|Jacob J Orme|Xu Zhang|Yu Hou|Sean S Park|Yu Zhang|Yi He|Liguo Wang|Veronica Rodriguez-Bravo|Josep Domingo-Domenech|Shancheng Ren|Dan Xia|Guanghou Fu|Zhankui Jia|Haojie Huang,Jacob J Orme|Xu Zhang|Sean S Park|Liguo Wang,"Department of Urology, Institute of Urologic Science and Technology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.|Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.|Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Pulmonology, Children's Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|The First Hospital of Jiaxing, Jiaxing, China.|Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai, China.","Xiang Li, Rui Sun, Hao Li, Jacob J Orme, Xu Zhang, Yu Hou, Sean S Park, Yu Zhang, Yi He, Liguo Wang, Veronica Rodriguez-Bravo, Josep Domingo-Domenech, Shancheng Ren, Dan Xia, Guanghou Fu, Zhankui Jia, Haojie Huang",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41542764/,"This research explores a promising new approach to treating prostate cancer, a type of cancer that has been difficult to treat with immunotherapy.

The key discovery was that prostate cancer cells actively suppress the body's immune defenses by producing a molecule called IKBKE, which blocks important immune signaling pathways. The researchers showed that the prostate cancer drug, by blocking the androgen receptor, allows the IKBKE gene to become ""derepressed"" or reactivated. This, in turn, enhances the ability of the immune system to detect and attack the cancer cells, especially when combined with radiation therapy to further stimulate the immune response.

41542757,2026-01-17,A Pragmatic Framework for Shared Decision Making in Older Adults: Cardiac Amyloidosis as a Prototype.,"Advanced chronic diseases, or multicomplexity in older adults presents unique challenges. Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is one such scenario where heart failure is a common presentation, and management remains challenging. We describe the challenges involved in the diagnosis of ATTR-CA in older adults, which has implications on treatment options. We discuss the application of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and shared decision making (SDM) in the context of these challenges. Based on geriatric medicine principles, an innovative framework for applying SDM in ATTR-CA patients is proposed, including consideration of the patient priorities care approach. The proposed framework emphasizes assessing functionality, frailty, and life expectancy to help categorize risk. This framework can be applied in various advanced chronic diseases or multicomplexity. Based on risk categorization, treatment burden, and alignment with values and preferences, management pathways are suggested for each risk category. Incorporating CGA and SDM, the proposed framework supports patient-centered care, ensuring that clinical recommendations are tailored to each older adult's unique needs and goals. In ATTR-CA, a collaboration between cardiology and geriatric medicine provides significant value in managing older adults. The need to prevent age-related bias in clinical decision-making exists across all health conditions, and the proposed framework allows for a thorough evaluation of multimorbidity, frailty, disability, and patient preferences. While ATTR-CA is used as a prototype, this integrated approach can be applied across all health conditions and is essential for delivering holistic care, improving communication, and aligning treatment plans with patient values.© 2026 The American Geriatrics Society.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Jan 16, 2026",2026.0,Jan,16.0,Monika Do|Sandesh Dev|Pranav Pillai|Ambar Andrade|Jeffrey Schmeckpeper|Megan Branda|Lori Herges|Sandeep Pagali|Nimit Agarwal,Megan Branda|Lori Herges|Sandeep Pagali,"US Department of Veteran's Affairs, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.|Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.|The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix and Banner University Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Monika Do, Sandesh Dev, Pranav Pillai, Ambar Andrade, Jeffrey Schmeckpeper, Megan Branda, Lori Herges, Sandeep Pagali, Nimit Agarwal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41542757/,"This research addresses the challenges of caring for older adults with complex, advanced medical conditions.

41540937,2026-01-17,Combined Use of EMG and Muscle Ultrasound for the Evaluation of Scapular Winging.,"Scapular winging occurs as an abnormal protrusion of the scapula due to nerve injury, muscle weakness, bone, or joint pathology. The main muscular stabilizers of the scapula include the serratus anterior, trapezius, rhomboid major and minor, levator scapulae, and pectoralis minor. Needle electromyography (EMG) has historically been used as one of the primary diagnostic tests for evaluating this finding. However, sampling of these muscles can be technically difficult and carries risks for complications. Muscle ultrasound (MUS) can also reliably identify abnormalities in the muscles involved in scapular stabilization while offering the benefit of rapid side-to-side comparison and improved patient comfort. This study aims to highlight the concordance of ultrasound and EMG findings using our published MUS protocol in patients with scapular winging.A retrospective analysis was performed of 13 patients who presented to an electrodiagnostic (EDX) laboratory with the referral diagnosis of ""scapular winging"" or ""scapular dyskinesis."" All patients underwent MUS testing of scapular muscles according to a previously published protocol followed by EMG of muscles deemed relevant by the clinician.Seven patients were found to have a neurogenic cause of their scapular winging and in those patients, all had both EMG and MUS abnormalities. MUS was found to have a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 95.7%, and individual muscle concordance with EMG of 90.6%.There is high concordance between EMG and MUS in patients with scapular winging.

41546876,2026-01-18,Balancing Bleeding and Ischemic Risk: Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in a 90-Year-Old Man With Myocardial Infarction and Gastrointestinal Bleeding.,"BACKGROUND Management of myocardial infarction (MI) in a patient with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding presents a clinical challenge with competing ischemic and bleeding risks. Distinction of type 1 MI from type 2 MI is particularly important when planning antiplatelet therapy. CASE REPORT A 90-year-old man presented with MI, severe acute-on-chronic anemia, and active GI bleeding. The etiology of his MI was unclear in the setting of severe coronary artery disease, although type 2 MI was favored when his chest pain resolved with blood transfusions. After treatment of his bleeding angiodysplasias, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was attempted but discontinued due to recurrent bleeding. Ischemic heart disease was managed conservatively with antiplatelet monotherapy, which was subsequently withheld after shared decision making with the patient. At the 3-month follow-up, his symptoms were controlled with optimized antianginal therapy, although he required rehospitalization for recurrent GI bleeding that was treated endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the nuances of treating acute ischemic heart disease and the complexity of decision making regarding DAPT in patients with high GI bleeding risk. The risks and benefits of DAPT should be continually assessed in patients who exhibit bleeding or have a risk of bleeding onset. If antiplatelet monotherapy is considered due to GI bleeding, P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel are preferable.

The researchers concluded that for older patients with both heart disease and a high risk of GI bleeding, the risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy must be carefully weighed on an individual basis. If antiplatelet monotherapy (a single blood-thinner) is used instead, the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel may be preferable to reduce bleeding risk. This case highlights the importance of tailoring",Cardiology,Gastroenterology

Appropriate large animal models mimicking the main MASH characteristics of steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte damage alongside progression of fibrosis are imperative for robust preclinical studies, especially in the field of hepatobiliary surgery. The present study aimed to characterize a novel model of steatohepatitis in fumarylacetoacetate hydroxylase-deficient (FAH-/-) pigs. FAH-/- pigs were generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. The animals received a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet and subtherapeutic doses of nitisinone and were followed for 3 months. Liver biopsies were obtained at baseline and every month during treatment. Steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were assessed by conventional histological scoring systems and by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. Serum liver parameters were analyzed every 2 weeks. Steatosis increased significantly throughout the study, with severe steatosis observed as early as 2 months into treatment. The inflammation score was increased in all animals after 3 months of treatment, whereas the AI-based CD45+ cell count showed region-specific trends in the portal and lobular areas. Collagen content and the corresponding fibrosis stage showed an increase over the 3-month period; however, the difference was not significant. Serum liver parameters did not show any relevant elevations during the study. In summary, we successfully developed and characterized a novel model of steatohepatitis in the FAH-/- pig within 3 months. Further studies with prolonged observation time and/or cycling of nitisinone administration are needed to evaluate whether progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis could be achieved with this model.",Veterinary pathology,"Jan 17, 2026",2026.0,Jan,17.0,Silvana N Wilken|Philipp Felgendreff|Anna Minshew|Boyukkhanim Ahmadzada|Seyed M Hosseiniasl|Sara Kazeminia|Kachi Ezenekwe|Ameya Patil|Byoung U Park|Ahmer Sultan|Lindsey Smith|Julio Cisneros Correa|Kamal Hussein|Harmeet Malhi|Roger K Moreira|Scott L Nyberg,Silvana N Wilken|Philipp Felgendreff|Anna Minshew|Boyukkhanim Ahmadzada|Seyed M Hosseiniasl|Sara Kazeminia|Kachi Ezenekwe|Ameya Patil|Ahmer Sultan|Julio Cisneros Correa|Kamal Hussein|Harmeet Malhi|Roger K Moreira|Scott L Nyberg,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.|Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH.|HonorHealth, Phoenix, AZ.|University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.|MysSME LLC, Birmingham, AL.|Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.","Silvana N Wilken, Philipp Felgendreff, Anna Minshew, Boyukkhanim Ahmadzada, Seyed M Hosseiniasl, Sara Kazeminia, Kachi Ezenekwe, Ameya Patil, Byoung U Park, Ahmer Sultan, Lindsey Smith, Julio Cisneros Correa, Kamal Hussein, Harmeet Malhi, Roger K Moreira, Scott L Nyberg",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41546493/,"This research focuses on a new animal model for studying a serious liver condition called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).

MRD-adapted strategies in BTK inhibitor + venetoclax combinations have also been explored, with studies suggesting that MRD-adapted therapy results in durable remissions and potential for reduced toxicity. Recent studies have begun to explore MRD-guided therapy duration for venetoclax + anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody regimens, allowing for tailored treatment based on the depth of response. In this review, we highlight that the predictive value of MRD appears to be regimen- and biology-specific, with differing implications for patients with mutated versus unmutated IGHV.While fixed-duration therapy simplifies treatment, MRD-guided approaches offer a more individualized strategy that may optimize outcomes while minimizing overtreatment. Ongoing trials will further define the role of MRD-adapted therapy duration in first-line CLL treatment.

However, research on the contribution of prenatal evaluation of zygosity to the management of twins is limited. We assessed the utility of adding SNP-based cell-free DNA (cfDNA) zygosity testing to ultrasound chorionicity assessment for the clinical management of twin pregnancies.Prospective observational study involving 13 United States practices with proficiency in prenatal ultrasound. Patients diagnosed by ultrasound with twins in the first trimester were assessed with cfDNA screening for zygosity. Ultrasound assessment of chorionicity was performed prior to cfDNA results. Placental pathology was used as the gold standard for chorionicity assessment. Gestational age at delivery and standardized birthweights were compared, based on chorionicity and zygosity.110 twin pregnancies were included. Among 79 dichorionic (DC) cases confirmed by placental pathology, one (1.3%) was misclassified as monochorionic (MC) by ultrasound, but was dizygous (DZ) by cfDNA, consistent with DC. Of 31 monozygotic (MZ) twins by cfDNA, confirmed as MC by pathology, ultrasound misclassified one (3.6%) as DC. Median gestational age at delivery was earlier for MZ twin pregnancies (35.0 weeks) compared to DZ (36.9 weeks, p = 0.02). After adjusting for fetal sex and gestational age at birth, MZDC twins had significantly lower birthweights (p = 0.006) and birthweight percentiles (p = 0.004) than DZDC twins.Based on postpartum placental pathology as the reference standard for determining MC versus DC, cfDNA zygosity testing appears to aid in the prenatal assignment of chorionicity.

Although various covering materials have been explored, the effectiveness of amniotic membrane (AM) as a stent cover has not been evaluated. This study is the first to assess airway-related complications of a novel AM-covered self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) compared with a commercially available synthetic polymer-covered SEMS. To compare the incidence of stent-related complications between AM-covered SEMS and synthetic polymer-covered SEMS over a 90-day in vivo survival period.Eight adult Yucatan miniswine were implanted with either an AM-covered or control stent and monitored over 90 days with bronchoscopic evaluations at 4 timepoints. Histologic assessments were performed at termination.Seven animals completed the study (4 AM stents, 3 controls). One control animal was terminated early due to stent expectoration. AM-covered stents were associated with reduced stent migration, mucostasis, and granulation tissue formation compared with controls. Histologic analysis revealed significantly less airway injury and evidence of re-epithelialization with cilia in the AM group; a feature absent in control stents. One animal was excluded at implantation and replaced due to a procedural complication unrelated to the stent.This is the first study to evaluate stent-related complications of AM-covered airway stents. The results demonstrate that AM-covered SEMS reduce airway injury and common complications associated with synthetic polymer-covered stents. These findings suggest that AM-coverings may enhance biocompatibility and integration while mitigating adverse airway responses.

Given frequent estrogen receptor (ER) expression and dysregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)-p16-Rb pathway, features shared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, dual endocrine, and CDK4/6 inhibition is a biologically rational strategy. This phase II trial evaluated ribociclib plus letrozole in recurrent LGSOC.This open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II study enrolled women with measurable, recurrent LGSOC. Patients received ribociclib (600 mg orally, once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) and letrozole (2.5 mg orally, once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary end points included clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.Of 74 patients screened, 51 were enrolled and 49 treated. The confirmed ORR was 30.6% (90% CI, 19.9 to 43.2), including one complete and 14 partial responses. Among responders, the median duration of response was 21.2 months. The CBR was 84% (90% CI, 72.5 to 91.6). The median PFS was 14.5 months (90% CI, 10.1 to 28.8), and the median OS was 44.5 months (90% CI, 31.8 to not reached). The most common grade ≥3 adverse event (AE) was neutropenia (47%), managed with dose modifications. Three grade 5 events (6%) occurred but were unrelated to treatment. Treatment discontinuation because of AEs occurred in 4%. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed.Ribociclib plus letrozole met the primary end point, achieving meaningful response rates and durable disease control in recurrent LGSOC.

41380115,2026-01-20,Management of Cancer During Pregnancy: ASCO Guideline.,"To provide guidance on the recommended management of cancer in pregnant patients.A multidisciplinary Expert Panel convened and conducted a systematic review of the literature.The systematic review identified 450 eligible studies. Much of the evidence consisted of observational data, case series, and case reports.Management of cancer during pregnancy should be grounded in a values-based informed-consent process outlining maternal and fetal risks and anticipated benefits. Diagnostic evaluation should follow the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle, with timing of diagnostic studies individualized based on urgency of cancer detection, potential dangers of delay, and the balance of risks to both the pregnant patient and her embryo or fetus. Due to significant risk of harm to the developing embryo and/or fetus, systemic therapy should be deferred until the second trimester. Methotrexate, hormonal therapies, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted agents, vascular endothelial growth factor and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and all cellular therapies are contraindicated during pregnancy, regardless of gestational age. For patients who wish to continue their pregnancy, delivery should be planned at or after 37 weeks, with the final chemotherapy dose scheduled 2-4 weeks before birth.

41061199,2026-01-20,Genomics Define Malignant Transformation in Myeloma Precursor Conditions.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is consistently preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). While these precursor conditions are asymptomatic, they are not entirely benign and carry a lifelong risk of progression to MM. Unlike other cancers defined by pathology, malignant transformation from MGUS or SMM to MM has so far relied on demonstration of clinical end-organ damage as morphology and cytogenetics cannot reliably distinguish them. In this study, using genomic data from 374 patients with MGUS or SMM (277 training, 97 validation), to our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to identify malignant transformation in MGUS and SMM. We introduce the concept of genomic MM and genomic MGUS to differentiate the subsets of MGUS and SMM that are biologically malignant with genomic features indistinguishable from MM from the subset that is premalignant and unlikely to progress to malignancy. Importantly, we find that most SMM has biological features of malignant transformation indistinguishable from MM. As expected, this subset that we consider having genomic MM is associated with a high risk of progression to MM although some patients remained progression-free beyond 5 years. Conversely, 60% of MGUS and 10% of SMM have no evidence of malignant transformation (genomic MGUS), with no progression during follow-up. Integration of genomic features with the 2/20/20 International Myeloma Working Group model significantly improved the prediction of progression among genomic MM.

Adults with CHD commonly have impairments in brain health. However, significant gaps in knowledge remain regarding the relevant types and prevalence of neurologic and psychiatric risk and their associated risk factors. We sought to review current evidence, identify gaps in knowledge, and develop key next steps to improve scientific understanding and clinical care. Three working groups-Genetics and Brain Health, Characterizing Neuropsychological and Psychological Outcomes, and Neuropsychological and Psychosocial Interventions-were composed of multidisciplinary experts in relevant clinical and research domains, as well as adults with CHD. Each group identified 5 key knowledge gaps and associated next investigations needed to address those gaps. For Genetics and Brain Health, 5 key knowledge gaps were identified: lack of a standardized neuroimaging protocol for adults with CHD, need to understand neuroradiological-pathological-neuropsychological correlates, role of gene-environment interactions, what can be learned from brain health risk models from other groups, and how existing multimodal approaches influence risk and neuroresilience. Adults with CHD can benefit from routine assessment of brain health, as well as increased clinical and basic research into the underlying factors that contribute to risk and neuroresilience for neurologic and psychiatric sequalae.

Multimodal imaging features can raise early clinical suspicion to support appropriate subspecialty referrals and treatment for patients affected by these conditions. This review synthesises current evidence on the diagnostic and prognostic value of characteristic imaging features of these rare malignancies. Findings are reviewed based on imaging modality, including fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography angiography, and ultrasound. We emphasise discriminative biomarkers that heighten suspicion for either vitreoretinal or choroidal lymphoma, as well as key findings to discriminate between lymphoma and alternative diagnoses. We further describe longitudinal changes in multimodal imaging features that can facilitate tracking disease progression or treatment response.

We sought to determine the impact of preoperative hand grip strength (HGS) on implant survivorship in these patients.We included primary pyrocarbon MCP arthroplasties in patients with RA at our single institution from 2000 to 2022. Cox proportional hazard models with restricted cubic splines were used to model the continuous relationship between HGS and hazard for revision, all-cause reoperation, and development of any complication, accounting for multiple joints per patient and adjusting for sex. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to report survivorship at 2, 5, and 10 years.We included 75 joints in 27 patients with an average preoperative HGS of 8.6 kg (11.1 years of follow-up). There were 16 (21%) total revisions, most commonly for recurrent deformity, along with 8 nonrevision reoperations, most commonly for tendon/ligamentous repair. There was a significant, J-shaped relationship between HGS and hazard for revision (P = .001) and all-cause reoperation (P < .001). Patients with HGS below 5.5 and 5.3 kg had an increased risk for revision (hazard ratio [HR]: 13.5) and all-cause reoperation (HR: 9.8) compared with patients with sufficiently high HGS. The 10-year revision survival was 93% in patients with HGS >5.5 kg and 63% in patients ≤5.5 kg.

Techniques have been proposed for accurate SHBF EMG; however, needle placement accuracy is low and with the risk of inadvertent needle placement into the long head (LHBF) potentially resulting in false localization and inappropriate operative management. This study aimed to define the optimal window for accurate SHBF needle EMG placement through ultrasound (US) investigation of the anatomical relationships of the SHBF, LHBF, and common fibular nerve (CFN) in the distal posterolateral thigh.Forty lower limbs from 20 healthy adults were evaluated using US. Distances from the popliteal crease (PC) to the SHBF and LHBF myotendinous junctions and position of the CFN in the popliteal fossa were recorded. The ""SHBF window"" was defined as the region where the SHBF muscle body is present in the absence of the LHBF.The SHBF was located anterolateral to the LHBF tendon/muscle and the CFN medial to the SHBF in all limbs. The average distances from the PC to SHBF and LHBF muscles were 0.6 and 6.4 cm, respectively. The optimal ""SHBF window"" was identified to be 3-4 cm (2-3 fingerbreadths) proximal to the PC, anterolateral to the LHBF tendon in the distal thigh.SHBF examination within this optimized window results in increased accuracy of needle placement, aiding in the electrodiagnostic localization of fibular nerve lesions.© 2026 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Muscle & nerve,"Jan 19, 2026",2026.0,Jan,19.0,Reece M Hass|Cecilia V Mitchell|James B Meiling|William J Litchy|Andrea J Boon,Reece M Hass|Cecilia V Mitchell|James B Meiling|William J Litchy|Andrea J Boon,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Reece M Hass, Cecilia V Mitchell, James B Meiling, William J Litchy, Andrea J Boon",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41553101/,"This research aimed to help doctors more accurately locate and examine a specific muscle in the back of the thigh, called the short head of the biceps femoris, using ultrasound imaging.

For these difficult-to-treat cases, topical antibiotic irrigations have been proposed as an adjunctive therapy, particularly when delivered via large-volume, low-pressure systems that enhance sinus penetration post-ESS. Evidence on their efficacy and prescribing patterns in this population remains limited.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the use and outcomes of topical antibiotic irrigations in patients with difficult-to-treat CRS.MethodsA retrospective, multi-site cohort study was conducted across tertiary academic medical centers. Adult patients with persistent CRS symptoms despite bilateral full-house ESS and conventional postoperative medical management were included. Patients with cystic fibrosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Primary outcomes were infection resolution at 8 weeks and changes in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores.ResultsSixty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Mupirocin (41.8%), tobramycin (23.9%), and gentamicin (17.9%) were the most commonly prescribed agents. After 8 weeks, 62.7% of patients achieved infection clearance. Among 44 patients with SNOT-22 data, scores improved significantly from 34.8 ± 20.2 to 21.8 ± 14.7 (P < .001).

This medical research study examined the impact of heart rate on the quality of images obtained during a coronary CT angiography (CCTA) procedure. CCTA is an important diagnostic tool that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the heart and its blood vessels, allowing doctors to check for blockages or other issues. However, a patient's heart rate during the scan can affect the clarity and usefulness of the images. 

The researchers analyzed CCTA scans from over 1,000 patients to see how different heart rates impacted the presence of motion-related artifacts - blurring or distortion caused by the heart's movement. They found that higher heart rates were associated with more motion artifacts, which reduced the overall diagnostic quality of the images. This is important because poor image quality can make it harder for doctors to accurately identify and diagnose heart problems.

41554690,2026-01-20,Site-saturation functional screens identify PALB2 missense variants associated with increased breast cancer risk.,"Loss-of-function variants in PALB2 give rise to defects in DNA damage repair by homologous recombination (HR), increasing the risk of breast cancer in female carriers. However, genetic testing frequently reveals missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS) for which the impact on protein function and cancer risk are unclear. Here we assay 84% of all possible missense variants in 11 out of 13 PALB2 exons using site-saturation functional screens with PARP inhibitor sensitivity as a readout for HR. These exons encode the coiled-coil and WD40 domains, which we identify as the minimal regions required for HR. Furthermore, we reveal the functional impact of 6718 missense variants, classifying 3904 variants as functional (58%), 2422 as intermediate (36%), and 392 as damaging (6%). A burden-type analysis shows that damaging missense variants in PALB2 are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer, similar to that observed for truncating variants. These results will be valuable for the classification of PALB2 missense VUS and clinical management of carriers.© 2026.

Infants were randomized to receive donor milk or preterm formula. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) Z-score at 22-26 months corrected age.Among 483 trial participants, 376 were seen at follow-up (181 donor milk, 195 formula). At 22-26 month follow-up, anthropometrics were similar for the two groups, including BMI Z-score (donor milk 0.21 ± 1.13, formula 0.23 ± 1.28, p = 0.67). There was a greater increase in weight Z-score between discharge and follow-up for children randomized to donor milk (donor milk 1.04 ± 1.28, formula 0.73 ± 1.30, p = 0.004).While BMI Z-scores were similar at 22-26 months corrected age, patterns of growth between discharge and follow-up differed by study diet.

The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) may help discriminate between upper GI bleeding (UGIB) and lower GI bleeding (LGIB). This study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of the BUN/Cr in distinguishing UGIB from LGIB.A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library to identify diagnostic test accuracy studies published from inception through January 31, 2025, which evaluated BUN/Cr in patients with UGIB versus LGIB. A linear mixed-effects model meta-analysis was conducted using the ""diagmeta"" package. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were estimated, and optimal threshold was determined using the Youden index.Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference in BUN/Cr between UGIB and LGIB patients was 11.44 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.35-14.52). At a threshold of > 30, pooled sensitivity was 38.8% (95% CI 28.1%-50.8%) and specificity was 89.3% (95% CI 81.0%-94.2%). At the optimal cut-off of 22, sensitivity was 66.2% (95% CI 57.8%-73.7%), specificity was 71.0% (95% CI 58.5%-81.0%), and AUC was 0.740 (95% CI 0.683-0.794).BUN/Cr demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing UGIB from LGIB, particularly at a threshold of ≥ 22.

Inflammation severity by conventional histology and staining intensity by immunohistochemistry were assigned three-tier scores (0/1+/2+), and a cut-off for staining percentage was set at 5%.38 biopsies from 31 patients were considered adequate for evaluation, and positive staining was detected in 80.6% of patients (34 biopsies). High expressors (22.6%) showed strong positive membranous staining (score 2+) with high staining density (more than 5% of inflammatory cells). Low expressors (58.1%) showed mild/moderate staining (score 1+) predominantly in less than 5% of the cells (91.6%) or expressed restricted cytoplasmic staining (6/31). All high expressors showed severe inflammation (score 2+) (p<0.001), and viable ova were only observed in these cases.

41247746,2026-01-21,Peripheral Neuropathy: A Review.,"Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide.Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments.Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms.

They measured glucagon levels and how the body breaks down glucagon in both healthy individuals and those with type 1 diabetes after they consumed a meal. The results showed that the higher glucagon levels in people with type 1 diabetes are caused by the body producing and releasing more glucagon shortly after eating, rather than any differences in how the body processes glucagon.

This medical research study explored a novel approach to managing pain and improving recovery after rotator cuff surgery. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons in the shoulder that can become damaged, often requiring surgical repair. Recovering from this surgery can be challenging, with patients experiencing significant pain and difficulty regaining full shoulder mobility. 

The researchers in this pilot study tested the use of auricular neuromodulation - a technique that applies gentle electrical stimulation to specific points on the outer ear - as a way to help manage post-operative pain and facilitate rehabilitation. They worked with a small group of patients who had undergone rotator cuff repair surgery, monitoring their progress and gathering feedback on the auricular neuromodulation treatment. 

The results suggest that this approach may be a feasible and well-tolerated option for improving outcomes after rotator cuff surgery. Patients reported reduced pain levels and were able to engage more actively in physical therapy, potentially",Surgery,
41556569,2026-01-21,Mapping Algorithmic Bias in AI-Powered Electrocardiogram Interpretation Across the AI Life Cycle: Protocol for a Scoping Review.,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered analysis of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is reshaping cardiac diagnostics, offering faster and often more accurate detection of conditions such as arrhythmias and heart failure. However, growing evidence suggests that algorithmic bias, defined as performance disparities across patient subgroups, may undermine diagnostic equity. These biases can emerge at any stage of the AI life cycle, including data collection, model development, evaluation, deployment, and clinical use. If unaddressed, they risk exacerbating health disparities, particularly in underrepresented populations and low-resource settings. Early identification and mitigation of such bias are essential to ensuring diagnostic equity.This scoping review protocol outlines a structured approach to mapping the evidence on algorithmic bias in AI-enabled ECG interpretation. Following the population-concept-context framework and PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidance, the planned review will systematically identify and categorize reported sources and types of bias, examine their effects on diagnostic performance across demographic and geographic subgroups, and document mitigation strategies applied throughout the AI life cycle. By synthesizing how bias and fairness considerations are handled in this field, this review aims to clarify existing evidence, highlight key gaps, and inform future efforts toward equitable and clinically trustworthy application of AI in cardiology.We will conduct a comprehensive literature search across 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and gray literature sources. Eligible studies will include original research (2015-2025) evaluating the performance of AI-based ECG models across different subgroups or reporting on bias mitigation strategies. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data using a standardized form, and resolve disagreements through consensus. This review will follow the PRISMA-ScR reporting framework.At the time of submission, study identification and screening has been completed. Database searches conducted in August and September 2025 yielded 430 records, with an additional 18 records identified through other sources. After duplicates removal, 398 unique records remained. Title and abstract screening led to the exclusion of 250 records, and 148 articles proceeded to full-text review. Following full-text assessment, 110 articles were evaluated for eligibility, of which 38 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. The study selection process is summarized in a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram. Data extraction was conducted between November and December 2025.This review will be the first to comprehensively map the landscape of algorithmic bias in AI-powered ECG interpretation. By identifying patterns of inequity and evaluating proposed solutions, it will provide actionable insights for developers, clinicians, and policymakers aiming to promote fairness in AI-enabled cardiac care.PRR1-10.2196/82486.©Luqman Lawal, Christopher Paton, Mike English, Bruno Holthof, Tabitha Preston.

41556744,2026-01-21,"Volatile Anesthetics: A Comprehensive Review of Pharmacology, Delivery Systems, and Safety Considerations for ICU Practitioners.","Volatile anesthetics (VAs) are gaining renewed interest as a sedation strategy in the intensive care, offering an alternative to traditional IV agents. VAs provide several pharmacologic advantages, including rapid onset and offset, minimal systemic metabolism, and favorable recovery profiles. Advances in delivery systems enabled the safe and practical administration of volatile agents in the ICU. Thus, we aimed to describe the pharmacology and safety aspects of inhaled agents as well as the systems designed to deliver VAs in the ICU.Relevant literature was identified through PubMed and MEDLINE databases.Original research, review articles, commentaries, and guidelines addressing safety, efficacy, and use of VAs in adult ICU patients were included.Studies were reviewed by the authors, with key findings summarized and organized by pharmacologic properties, delivery systems, and safety domains.VAs are halogenated hydrocarbons whose mechanism of action is not fully understood. Although the CNS is the primary site of action, the end-tidal concentration of exhaled anesthetic is used to monitor clinical effects such as immobility to a noxious stimulus. Inhaled agents have unique pharmacokinetics, minimal metabolisms, and distinct recovery. The side effect profile is also unique, with malignant hyperthermia being the most feared, yet rare complication. Two systems for inhalational sedation delivery are available internationally, with one currently under evaluation in the United States. The systems are composed of a miniature vaporizer, delivery controller, and a monitor. The systems have distinct safety considerations, such as tidal volume limits.VAs can be used as sedative agents in the ICU. This article comprehensively reviews the pharmacology of VAs along with their safety profile and describes the structure and function of miniature vaporizers currently available on the world market.Copyright © 2026 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

There are limited national data on these changes and instances of unsanctioned deviations from patient care, yet understanding the COVID response is key to future preparedness efforts. We sought to understand how hospitals and states navigated scarcity during COVID-19, particularly in the absence of a declaration of crisis standards of care.Between February 2022 and September 2022 we conducted 34 interviews with 36 leaders of U.S. states' COVID-19 planning and response efforts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and verified. We analyzed interviews using iterative inductive thematic analysis for descriptions of resource scarcity and changes to policies and procedures to prevent rationing lifesaving care.Nearly all participants described equipment and personnel scarcity in their home institution or state during COVID-19. Hospitals across regions and states developed formal and informal coordination processes for load and resource sharing in response to influxes of high-acuity patients, avoiding formal rationing of lifesaving resources in many regions. Participants also described unsanctioned patient triage, early discharge, and patients counseled to accept less aggressive care (e.g., premature transition to hospice) in states that had not declared crisis standards of care.Extending limited resources and inter-institutional collaboration helped avoid formal rationing. Yet, patient care was unquestionably impacted due to scarcity, both real and perceived. Reports of using hospital triage protocols to deny patients lifesaving care outside of formally recognized crisis conditions and attempts to nudge patients to accept less-resource-intensive care are concerning. This may have had disproportionate effects on older adults, individuals with disabilities, and racial and ethnic minoritized groups. To avoid unsanctioned deviations from standard practice in future health emergencies, we recommend that transparent and equitable triage protocols are implemented with robust oversight.© 2026 The American Geriatrics Society.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Jan 20, 2026",2026.0,Jan,20.0,Jackson S Ennis|Kirsten A Riggan|Nicholas V Nguyen|Alexander K Smith|Daniel B Kramer|Daniel P Sulmasy|Jon C Tilburt|Erin S DeMartino,Jackson S Ennis|Kirsten A Riggan|Nicholas V Nguyen|Jon C Tilburt|Erin S DeMartino,"Biomedical Ethics Research Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Warren Alpert School of Medicine, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.|Health Ethics & Policy Lab, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.|Department of Medicine, Division of Geriatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.|San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA.|Richard A. and Susan F.

Estradiol (E2) replacement, a known vasodilator, may potentially reverse vascular dysfunction and improve psychological health.To evaluate 12 weeks of physiologic E2 replacement on vascular, hormonal, and psychological outcomes in women with FHA.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 29 women with FHA with 0.1 mg/day transdermal E2 (n = 14) or placebo patch (n = 15) twice weekly for 12 weeks. FHA was defined as amenorrhea ≥3 consecutive months, E2 < 50 pg/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) <10 mIU/L, LH:FSH <1, excluding other etiologies. Endothelial dysfunction (reactive hyperemic index ≤ 1.67) was assessed, as were hormonal and psychological measures.Women with FHA had a mean age of 26.2 ± 6.3 years, body mass index of 21.5 ± 3.3 kg/m2, with 63% being non-Hispanic White. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. After 12 weeks, E2 levels were significantly higher in the E2 group (112.0 vs 36.5 pg/mL, P = .0002). However, there were no significant differences in vascular, hormonal, or psychological outcomes between E2 and placebo groups at week 12. Cortisol levels showed a near-significant decrease in the E2 group compared to an increase with placebo (-.4 vs 3.1 µg/dL, P = .05).In women with FHA, 12 weeks of transdermal E2 increased serum E2 levels but did not improve vascular or psychological health measures. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to explore the long-term effects of E2 therapy on cardiovascular and mental health outcomes in this population.© The Author(s) 2025.

There is a need for effective, noninvasive alternatives.To systematically evaluate the efficacy of repurposed pharmacologic agents in reducing the size of BTNs.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Scopus were searched from inception to December 18, 2024.We included preclinical and clinical studies evaluating repurposed drugs for BTNs in adults. Of 1499 records screened, 20 studies met inclusion criteria: 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 prospective cohorts, 3 retrospective observational studies, 3 case reports, 1 cross-sectional study, and 1 preclinical study.Data were extracted independently in duplicate using a standardized form.Narrative synthesis was conducted due to heterogeneity. Metformin was the most frequently evaluated agent (7 studies), with 5 studies (including 2 RCTs) reporting statistically significant reductions in dominant nodule volume. One prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the maximum nodule diameter, which was not statistically significant, and 1 RCT showed no changes in nodule size after intervention. Statins (4 studies) and somatostatin analogues (4 studies) showed mixed results. Myo-inositol with selenium, herbal formulations, and immune checkpoint inhibitors showed promise in single studies or case reports.Metformin shows the most consistent potential for noninvasive reduction of BTN size, particularly in patients with metabolic comorbidities. However, current evidence is limited and heterogeneous. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm efficacy and guide clinical use.© The Author(s) 2025.

41562191,2026-01-22,"Comparison of a Reformulated Automated Vitamin D Assay, Its Predecessor, and 2 Contemporary Formulations.","Historically, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays have under- or over-recovered 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2), but assay manufacturers have modified their reagents to address this problem. In this study, we compared the second- and third-generation Roche assays as well as two contemporary offerings from Diasorin and Beckman against liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).We identified 50 remnant serum samples with 25OHD concentrations from across the analytical range of the second-generation Roche assay. To increase 25OHD2 representation, we identified 25 additional samples from individuals prescribed high-dose vitamin D2 supplements. We tested samples on Roche assays and circulated to laboratories performing Beckman and Diasorin 25OHD assays. We tested samples by LC-MS/MS to obtain concentrations for 25OHD2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.Mean overall bias for each assay was 5.1 ng/mL or less against the LC-MS/MS measurement; mean proportional bias was 8.7% to 12.1%. Some individual specimens had much larger bias. 25OHD2 was under-recovered on average, but the bias for the third-generation Roche assay represents a significant improvement over the previous assay, and mean bias for current generation assays was no worse than -3.2 ng/mL. In most cases, clinical classification by automated assay values agreed with clinical classification by LC-MS/MS; where present, disagreements occurred near classification thresholds.Automated 25OHD assays continue to improve, and 25OHD2 recovery no longer appears to be a significant concern for the assays evaluated here.

Manual dentate segmentation was performed to extract magnetic susceptibility and volume adjusted for total intracranial volume. Shape deformation was assessed using Deformetrica atlas construction. Group comparisons were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis tests and receiver operating characteristic analysis.Patients with PSP-Richardson syndrome, PSP-parkinsonism, and PSP-cortical variants showed significantly increased dentate susceptibility compared with controls (P < 0.05). Patients with PSP-progressive gait freezing showed no significant susceptibility differences. Volume loss was most prominent in PSP-cortical variants, bilaterally, and PSP-Richardson syndrome, left hemisphere only (P < 0.05). Shape analysis revealed subregion-specific deformation patterns, especially in the anterior and posterior deformation in PSP-progressive gait freezing and the ventroanterior deformation in PSP-cortical variants.The PSP clinical variants had different patterns of susceptibility, volume, and shape metrics, reflecting distinct neurodegenerative patterns of the cerebellar dentate.

41562331,2026-01-22,NANETS Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Stage I-III Rectal NETs.,"Rectal neuroendocrine tumors (rNETs) are among the most common NETs and account for approximately 12-27% of all gastrointestinal NETs in North America. Significant discrepancies persist in the management of NETS regarding surveillance strategies, staging modalities, high-risk features, and criteria for surgical intervention.This guideline updates current practices of rectal NETs stage I-III with the utilization of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology and consensus DELPHI agreement across leading experts in the North American region.Several technological advances such as 68-Gallium-or 64 Cu-DOTATATE SRRT PET/CT and broad adoption of pelvic MRI has improved staging of rNETs, along with modified endoscopic mucosal and submucosal resection and full thickness excision techniques that demonstrate efficacy and safety for resection. Pivotal long-term outcome studies provide insight to 1) risk factors for regional lymph node metastasis, 2) the impact of R1 excision (endoscopic), 3) best practices for intermediate sized rNETs (11-20mm), and 4) risk in small rNETs (<10 mm). Recommendations were developed upon evidence-based conclusions from the GRADE review to define the role of baseline staging with MRI, advanced endoscopy and transanal endoscopic surgical methods appropriate for T1 rNETs, the role of salvage therapy in cases of R1 resection, and the consideration of pathologic variables to direct definitive treatment and surveillance.Advances in screening programs and imaging allow for improved detection and staging of rNETs, while long-term outcome studies can better direct patients towards evidence-based treatment management and rectal organ preservation through less radical resection methods.",Endocrine-related cancer,"Jan 21, 2026",2026.0,Jan,21.0,Hagen Kennecke|Ebrahim Delpassand|Seth Felder|Ferga Gleeson|Julie Hallet|David Horowitz|Martin Hyrcza|Bryson W Katona|Maria Kiely|Michelle Kim|Nadine Mallak|Vicky Parkins|Madhulika G Varma|Janice Pasieka,Ferga Gleeson,"Professor of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.|Department of Nuclear Medicine, Excel Diagnostics & Nuclear Oncology Center, Houston, TX, USA.|Department of Gastrointestinal Surgical Oncology, H.

Of the 1,331,740 cancers diagnosed in 2022 at 1,250 reporting CoC hospitals, the NCDB's five most common adult cancers varied by sex. In men, the top five cancers in the 2022 NCDB PUF were Prostate, Lung (Bronchus-Non-Small Cell Carcinoma), Melanoma of the Skin, Urinary Bladder, and Colon; in women, they were Breast, Lung (Bronchus-Non-Small Cell Carcinoma), Corpus Uteri, Colon, and Melanoma of the Skin. Roughly half of patients with esophageal cancer presented with Stage IV disease in 2022. Most (70.5%) patients did not undergo surgical resection; for those who did, esophagectomy was most common. Increasing clinical stage group and grade were associated with poorer overall survival. Melanoma presents most often as stage 1 disease (68.1%). Among invasive melanomas, histology was most commonly superficial spreading melanoma (43.5%) with a primary tumor site in the skin of the trunk (30.3%) and upper limb and shoulder (25.1%). Increasing clinical stage and presence of ulceration were associated with poorer survival. Men with prostate cancer were most commonly diagnosed with Stage II disease. Most (61.5%) did not receive surgical treatment, but among those that did, the most common surgical procedure performed was prostatectomy (85.4%).

Recent international consensus identified establishing benchmark values for robotic Whipple as top priority.We analyzed consecutive patients undergoing robotic Whipple between 2020-2023 with a minimum one-year follow-up. Reference centers were required to perform ≥15 cases/year, be scientifically active in the field, and maintain a prospective database. Benchmark criteria included benign or resectable malignant disease without neoadjuvant therapy, arterial resection, major co-morbidities, or significant previous abdominal surgery. Benchmarks were established for 13 outcome parameters.The benchmark cohort comprised 418 patients from 12 centers across four continents. Benchmark values were: conversion rate ≤4.3%, transfusion rate ≤2.1%, 6-month mortality ≤2.2%, major complications ≤23.2%, and CCI® ≤20.9. Clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (grade B/C) and hemorrhage (grade B/C) rates were ≤23.6% and ≤12.7%, respectively. For pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=123), the benchmark for lymph node yield was ≥20. Higher surgical difficulty was associated with increased overall postoperative morbidity (R2=0.38, P=0.019), higher center caseload with reduced pancreas-specific complications (R2=0.28, P=0.044). Independent POPF predictors included duct diameter ≤4 mm (OR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.82), anticoagulation (OR 2.45, 95% CI: 1.47, 3.99), and indication other than PDAC (OR 2.33, 95% CI: 1.68, 3.27).This study establishes the first international benchmarks for robotic Whipple, demonstrating oncologic outcomes and morbidity comparable to open surgery with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41566128,2026-01-22,Do Tumor Deposits Demand More? Association of Chemotherapy Regimen Intensity with Survival Outcomes in N1 Colon Cancer Patients with Tumor Deposits.,"Tumor deposits (TDs) in stage III colon cancer are associated with worse outcomes, yet the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) system only accounts for TDs as N1c in the absence of positive lymph nodes. The Sassun-Mayo staging system integrates TDs with nodal count, often upstaging N1 patients to N2; however, therapeutic implications remain unclear as chemotherapy regimens differ between stages.This retrospective, multicenter, cohort study included patients with AJCC stage III N1 colon adenocarcinoma with one or more TD. Exclusion criteria were age >75 years, inadequate chemotherapy, and no follow-up. Patients were categorized as 'treated as N1' (3 months of FOLFOX or 6 months of capecitabine/5-fluorouracil) versus 'treated as N2' (6 months of FOLFOX or 3-6 months of XELOX).In total, 110 patients were included; 27 (25%) were treated as N1, and 83 (75%) were treated as N2, with balanced baseline characteristics. Patients receiving N2-level chemotherapy had better 5-year outcomes than receiving N1 chemotherapy protocols. Overall survival was 87.5% versus 67.6% (p = 0.010), and disease-free survival was 81.3% versus 61.2% (p = 0.023). In multivariable analyses adjusted for pT stage, N2-level therapy was associated with a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.79; p = 0.015) and recurrence (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19-0.92; p = 0.031). We found that 3-6 months of XELOX yielded the highest disease-free survival, whereas capecitabine/5-fluorouracil and 3 months of FOLFOX were associated with the poorest outcomes.Patients with TD-positive N1 colon cancer may benefit from N2-level chemotherapy. Incorporating TDs into nodal count may refine prognostic accuracy and improve treatment selection, potentially warranting updates to staging guidelines.© 2026.

The researchers looked at 110 patients with this type of colon cancer and compared those who received a more intensive chemotherapy regimen (typically used for more advanced stage cancer) to those who received a less intensive regimen. They found that patients who received the more intensive chemotherapy had significantly better 5-year survival and lower risk of cancer recurrence compared to those on the less intensive treatment. This suggests that incorporating the presence of tumor deposits into the cancer staging system could help identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive chemotherapy, potentially improving outcomes for this high-risk group.

Lactate has emerged as a central biomarker in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of shock, yet its interpretation is complex and context dependent. Although traditionally viewed as a marker of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoperfusion, hyperlactatemia in distributive shock, particularly sepsis, frequently reflects multifactorial mechanisms, including increased aerobic glycolysis, adrenergic stimulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired hepatic clearance. This review examines the pathophysiology and classification of shock, the biochemical basis of lactate production and clearance, and the prognostic significance of both static lactate levels and lactate kinetics. We synthesize evidence supporting lactate as a robust prognostic marker while highlighting limitations of lactate-targeted resuscitation strategies. Emerging data favor multimodal approaches integrating lactate trends with complementary perfusion markers such as capillary refill time and central venous oxygen saturation. Lactate should be interpreted as one component of a comprehensive physiological assessment rather than an isolated therapeutic target.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

CAS plays a central role in vasospastic angina, ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries and myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, malignant arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle hyperreactivity, inflammation, oxidative stress, autonomic imbalance, and genetic susceptibility, with notable ethnic and sex-related differences. Diagnosis relies on integration of clinical features, electrocardiographic changes, and invasive coronary provocation testing using acetylcholine or ergonovine, supported by advanced imaging and functional assessment when microvascular involvement is suspected. Management is centered on calcium channel blockers and nitrates, aggressive risk factor modification, particularly smoking cessation, and individualized strategies for refractory or high-risk patients.

However, patient expectations for the surgery's outcomes can vary widely, which can impact their satisfaction and recovery.

The researchers analyzed interviews with patients to better understand where their expectations come from. They found that a person's expectations are influenced by a mix of factors, including their own past experiences, information from healthcare providers, advice from friends and family, and media portrayals of the surgery. Patients' expectations are also shaped by their overall health, lifestyle, and goals for the procedure. Understanding these diverse influences can help doctors have more meaningful discussions with patients about what they can realistically expect from a total knee replacement.

However, concerns remain about recurrence risk, long-term survival, and quality-of-life trade-offs with organ-preserving strategies.To evaluate the long-term comparative effectiveness of active surveillance vs standard esophagectomy in patients with cCR following nCRT for locally advanced esophageal cancer, using updated data from the SANO trial.This decision analytical model used Markov modeling and probabilities and utility inputs derived from the SANO trial and existing literature. The base case was a 60-year-old male with good functional status and cT3N1M0 esophageal cancer achieving cCR after nCRT.Standard routine esophagectomy vs active surveillance after neoadjuvant chemoradiation.The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); the secondary outcome was life-years. Additional model scenarios explored (1) quality-of-life impacts of esophagectomy modeled as a time-varying covariate and (2) 2-year outcomes to align with the SANO trial time horizon. Sensitivity analyses evaluated recurrence probabilities and surgery-related quality-of-life trade-offs.At 5 years, standard surgery yielded greater QALYs (1.74 vs 1.34; incremental gain of 0.40 QALYs or ~4.8 months in perfect health) and life-years (3.11 vs 2.41; incremental gain of 0.70 life-years or ~8.4 months) compared with active surveillance. However, at a 2-year horizon, active surveillance was preferred for QALYs (incremental gain of ~15 days), consistent with the SANO trial. Sensitivity analyses revealed the model favored active surveillance when the recurrence probability was less than 43%, the likelihood of local/resectable recurrence was greater than 94%, or the negative quality-of-life impact of esophagectomy was substantial. Modeling esophagectomy's quality-of-life impact as time limited further strengthened surgery's long-term QALY benefit.This study found that while active surveillance offers short-term quality-of-life benefits and may be appropriate in select patients, particularly those at low recurrence risk or with high surgical risk, esophagectomy remains the preferred strategy for maximizing long-term survival and QALYs.

Nevertheless, ICE utilization shows substantial geographic variability, and its clinical benefit remains incompletely understood. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy, safety, and procedural performance of ICE-guided versus non-ICE-guided AF ablation.MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched through 3 August 2025. Three reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment. Random-effects models were used to pool data from 44 AF ablation studies comprising 482,043 patients.

Cardiac troponin is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged, so measuring it can help diagnose heart attacks and other heart conditions. The researchers collected blood samples from over 4,000 healthy people across several countries and used the new test to measure their troponin levels. They found that normal troponin levels differ between men and women, with men having slightly higher levels on average. The researchers determined the upper limit of the normal range, which can help doctors interpret troponin test results and diagnose heart problems more accurately. This is important because the new troponin test is more sensitive than older versions, allowing earlier detection of heart damage but requiring updated reference values.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a novel sleep positioning device (SPD) on lung function in LT recipients with GERD.In this single-center cohort study, LT recipients (2014 to 2019) with GERD who were prescribed an SPD within 2 years of LT were included. A historical control group of LT recipients with GERD on PPI only (2011 to 2013) was selected to compare forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as a marker of lung function.Twenty LT recipients using SPD (cases) and 54 patients in the historical control group with proven GERD were included. Mean (SD) interval between LT and SPD prescription was 8.6 (5.7) months. Mean % predicted FEV1 was higher in SPD users than controls post-LT at 6 months (80% vs. 69%) and 1 year (80% vs. 71%), respectively. Among SPD users, post-SPD FEV1 was higher than pre-SPD FEV1 (82% vs. 70%).Use of a novel SPD can stabilize or improve pulmonary function in patients with GERD after LT. SPD may be a safe and cost-effective adjunctive therapy for the management of GERD after LT.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers compared lung function, measured by a test called FEV1, in two groups of lung transplant patients with GERD. One group used the sleep positioning device, which is designed to keep the body angled in a way that prevents stomach acid from backing up. The other group only took medication to manage their GERD. The results showed that the patients using the sleep positioning device had better lung function at 6 months and 1 year after their transplant compared to the control group.

After UroActive® implantation, follow up was planned for 5 years (post-activation). Study endpoints included successful device activation, revision, and explantation rates. Other endpoints assessed 24 h pad-weight test reduction, pad usage, uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine, patient-reported outcomes (ICIQ-UI SF, EQ-5D, I-QOL, USP). Adverse events were collected throughout the study.All six patients underwent successful implantation and device activation (100%). No explants or revisions were required during the 365 days post-activation. At 365 days post-activation, the pad weight was reduced by ≥50% in all patients and reduced by ≥75% in five (83.3%). Median pad use decreased from 3.7 to 1.0 pads/day. Uroflowmetry remained within acceptable ranges, and post-void residual urine was minimal. Quality of life scores significantly improved across all instruments. Nine device deficiencies were reported, all involving the patient remote control. No unanticipated serious adverse events occurred.In men with SUI, the UroActive® device demonstrates promising feasibility, safety, and functional outcomes during the 365 days post-activation. Patients experienced substantial symptom improvement and high satisfaction, with no surgical revisions.

41564353,2026-01-22,Early graft failure after adult living donor liver transplantation: A multicenter risk analysis and development of the early allograft failure in living donor liver transplantation (EAGLE-LDLT) model.,"Early allograft failure (EAF) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) remains a clinical challenge. Existing prediction models developed for deceased donor transplantation poorly apply to LDLT due to distinct surgical and physiological factors. This study identifies clinical determinants of EAF and develops an LDLT-specific prediction model.We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study from seventeen high-volume LDLT centers (January 2016-December 2020) with external validation at a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia (January 2015-December 2022). The primary outcome was EAF (graft loss or patient death ≤90 d). Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression identified preoperative/intraoperative risk factors. The EAGLE-LDLT model was constructed using postoperative laboratory values. Performance was compared against established models (EAD, MEAF, A2ALL) using ROC analysis and decision curve analysis.The development cohort included 2,944 adult LDLT recipients (67.7% male; median age 55 y; median MELD 14) with 5.5% EAF rate. External validation included 1,020 recipients (median MELD 21, 6.7% EAF). Independent risk factors for EAF were MELD (OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.04-1.08), donor BMI (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.00-1.10), portal vein thrombosis (OR 1.73, 95%CI 1.13-2.63), and hepaticojejunostomy (OR 1.58, 95%CI 1.06-2.36). The EAGLE-LDLT model incorporating peak ALT (>468 U/L), peak INR (>1.9), and bilirubin (>3.5 mg/dL) and INR (>1.3) at POD7, demonstrated superior discrimination (AUC=0.81) compared to MEAF (AUC=0.77, p=0.004), EAD (AUC=0.67, p<0.001), and A2ALL (AUC=0.65, p<0.001). EAGLE-LDLT achieved balanced sensitivity (75.0%) and specificity (73.7%), effectively stratifying patients into high-risk (15% of patients; 40.4% EAF incidence) and low-risk groups.Preoperative and intraoperative clinical factors predict EAF in LDLT.

The researchers analyzed brain scans from a patient with sepsis who developed PRES. They found that the scans showed numerous small, bright spots around the blood vessels in the brain, a pattern called ""miliary perivascular space enhancement."" This suggests that the infection and inflammation in sepsis can cause fluid to build up around the brain's blood vessels, contributing to the brain swelling seen in PRES.

We investigated the frequency of SDB among neonates with fetal vs postnatal myelomeningocele repair.In this nine-center, prospective, observational study, neonates with myelomeningocele born at more than 30 weeks gestational age underwent a 10-hour bedside polysomnogram at at least 35 weeks postmenstrual age, before hospital discharge. The primary outcome was SDB severity, reflected by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; number of respiratory events per hour of sleep). Decisions regarding surgical timing (fetal vs postnatal), technique (open fetal vs fetoscopic approach), and SDB treatment were made by the clinical teams.Among 173 infants, 92/173 (53%) had SDB (median AHI 22.5, IQR 12.2-44.2). In unadjusted analysis, AHI was higher among the 90 neonates with fetal repair vs 83 with postnatal surgery (median 29, IQR 14-49, vs 19, IQR 10-36, P = .008). In propensity-adjusted multivariable models, prematurity was independently associated with AHI, whereas surgical timing (fetal vs postnatal) was not. Hindbrain herniation, myelomeningocele level, and clinical need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt did not predict AHI in adjusted models. Supplemental oxygen was commonly prescribed, for 44% of fetal vs 39% of postnatal myelomeningocele repair infants (P = .5).SDB affects more than half of neonates with myelomeningocele. The higher AHI after fetal surgery could stem from the elevated incidence of prematurity in this group.

However, the onset of active disease, as defined by the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group SLiM-CRAB criteria, is often linked to substantial and irreversible morbidity. MM always develops from an asymptomatic precursor state called smouldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The clinical trajectory of SMM varies considerably; low-risk SMM often has an indolent course, similar to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, whereas nearly half of the subset of patients with high-risk SMM have progression to symptomatic MM within 2 years. Highly active treatments for MM, which remains an incurable disease, are being investigated for the management of SMM, with the aim of delaying or even preventing such progression. Both early therapeutic intervention and active surveillance are reasonable management options for patients with high-risk SMM, with decisions individualized through a detailed risk-benefit discussion with the patient.

This analysis revealed several previously undescribed PT synthesis systems, including type 4 Bacteriophage Exclusion (BREX) type 4 brx genes, which we genetically validated in Bacteroides salyersiae. Mass spectrometric analysis of DNA from 226 gut microbiome isolates possessing dnd, ssp, and brx genes revealed 8 PT dinucleotide settings confirmed in 10 consensus sequences by PT-specific DNA sequencing. Genomic analysis showed PT enrichment in rRNA genes and depletion at gene boundaries.

In this study, researchers explored a little-known process called phosphorothioation (PT), where sulfur atoms are added to the DNA of certain gut bacteria. 

The researchers analyzed over 13,000 gut microbiome samples and found that 6% of them contained genes responsible for PT. Interestingly, they discovered a previously unknown PT system, called BREX type 4, which helps protect bacteria from viral infections. Using advanced techniques, the team mapped out the specific locations of PT modifications across bacterial genomes, finding that they are more common in genes involved in essential processes like making ribosomes.

41571432,2026-01-23,Subtracting First Principal Component May Improve 4R Tau Detectability on [18F]Flortaucipir Tau PET.,"[18F]flortaucipir PET imaging has shown relatively low sensitivity for detecting four-repeat (4R) tau, which limits its utility in 4R tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Previous studies have suggested that the first component of principal-component analysis includes non-disease-related uptake in non-Alzheimer tauopathies. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that subtracting this component could increase sensitivity to 4R tau using a large PSP cohort. Methods: Prospectively recruited patients with PSP (n = 141; 80 Richardson syndrome, 44 PSP-subcortical, and 17 PSP-cortical variants) and controls (n = 102) underwent [18F]flortaucipir PET. The first principal component (PC1) was extracted from the SUV ratio (SUVR) images of 62 controls and then subtracted from the remaining controls (n = 40) and all PSP patients. We compared the diagnostic performance before and after PC1 subtraction by evaluating SUVR differences between PSP and controls, as well as across PSP clinical variants, and by calculating correlation coefficients between SUVR and the severity of tau pathology. Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves differentiating PSP and controls were improved by PC1 subtraction in the frontal white matter (0.54 to 0.67; P = 0.002) and subcortical (0.69 to 0.87; P < 0.001) regions. In the frontal regions, no differences were observed across PSP clinical variants before PC1 subtraction, whereas the PSP-cortical variant showed an SUVR higher than that of the PSP Richardson syndrome and PSP-subcortical variants after PC1 subtraction (adjusted P < 0.05). A correlation with the severity of tau pathology was observed only in the red nucleus before PC1 subtraction, whereas correlations were observed in the precentral, superior frontal gyrus, and red nucleus after PC1 subtraction (adjusted P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our approach enhanced the diagnostic performance of [18F]flortaucipir PET in PSP and increased sensitivity to 4R tau, suggesting that subtracting the first principal component improves the detectability of subtle 4R tau uptake and the potential utility of [18F]flortaucipir PET imaging for non-Alzheimer tauopathies.© 2026 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",J Nucl Med,"Jan 22, 2026",2026.0,Jan,22.0,Ryota Satoh|Farwa Ali|Dennis W Dickson|Val J Lowe|Keith A Josephs|Jennifer L Whitwell,Ryota Satoh|Farwa Ali|Dennis W Dickson|Val J Lowe|Keith A Josephs|Jennifer L Whitwell,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; satoh.ryota@mayo.edu.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and.|Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Ryota Satoh, Farwa Ali, Dennis W Dickson, Val J Lowe, Keith A Josephs, Jennifer L Whitwell",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41571432/,"This research aimed to improve the ability of a brain imaging technique called [18F]flortaucipir PET to detect a specific type of abnormal brain protein called four-repeat (4R) tau. 4R tau is associated with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare and debilitating neurological disorder.

41571428,2026-01-23,Multisociety multispecialty consensus recommendations on corticosteroid injections for facet joint and sacroiliac joint pain.,"Corticosteroid injections (CSIs) are widely employed in facet and sacroiliac joint pain. Similar to CSIs at other sites (peripheral nerve blocks, joints, epidural), these injections are associated with potential adverse events. These multisociety consensus recommendations aim to develop evidence-based statements and recommendations on the safe use of CSIs in facet joint and sacroiliac joint injections.Development of the consensus recommendations was approved by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Board of Directors and several other societies that agreed to participate. The scope of statements and recommendations was agreed on to include safety of the injection technique (landmark-guided, ultrasound, or radiology-aided injections); effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on effectiveness (vs local anesthetic or saline); and adverse events related to the injection. Experts were assigned topics to perform a comprehensive literature review and draft statements and recommendations, which were refined and voted for consensus (>75% agreement) using a modified Delphi process. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed.All statements and recommendations were approved by all participants after four rounds of discussion. The Practice Guidelines Committees and Boards of Directors of the participating societies also approved all statements and recommendations. Injection of corticosteroid into the facet joint in patients with joint inflammation may relieve pain and improves function. Intra-articular, extra-articular (periarticular), and combined administration are effective for sacroiliac joint injections. No dose-response studies exist, but CSIs containing 10 mg of methylprednisolone or triamcinolone per facet joint and 40 mg per sacroiliac joint (SIJ) (or their respective pharmacologic equivalents) are reasonable.In this practice recommendation, we provide statements and recommendations on facet and sacroiliac joint CSIs, the optimal doses, and intervals and criteria for repeating the CSIs in patients with facet joint and sacroiliac joint pain.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2026.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging, antifungal therapy, and surgical techniques may have altered its incidence, morbidity, and mortality.To evaluate temporal trends in the pooled proportion, morbidity, and mortality of AIFRS in immunocompromised patients and assess the association of diagnostic and therapeutic advances.Systematic searches of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from 1977 through October 20, 2025, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.Prospective, retrospective, and cross-sectional studies and case series reporting pooled proportion, morbidity, or mortality of AIFRS in immunocompromised patients were included. Non-English articles, reviews, editorials, and studies with fewer than 10 patients were excluded.Two independent reviewers extracted data using standardized templates; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Murad tool for case series. Random-effects meta-analysis generated pooled proportion, morbidity, and mortality rates with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses evaluated temporal trends and study-level effects.Pooled proportion, morbidity, and mortality rates of AIFRS stratified by publication period (1983-2012 vs 2013-2025).A total of 205 studies comprising 48 437 immunocompromised patients (median [range] age, 49.4 [5.2-68.8] years), including 10 311 (21.3%) with AIFRS, were analyzed.

The methylation signature(s), gene expression characteristics and clinical behavior of this important tumor type require further characterization.We study the methylation profiles of 81 ICMT cases (61 newly profiled cases and 20 cases from publicly available sources). Clinicopathologic and genomic data were recorded for each case when available.ICMT showed a relatively distinct methylation signature compared to related tumors. Among the 65 cases where fusion types were documented, the identified fusions included EWSR1::ATF1 (25 cases), EWSR1::CREB1 (12 cases), EWSR1::CREM (21 cases), FUS::CREM (3 cases) and SMARCA2::CREM (4 cases). We confirmed the prior description of two distinct subgroups of ICMT (subclasses A and B). The majority of the cases belonged to subclass A (n = 69; 85%), which showed higher median age compared to subclass B patients (26 years vs. 15 years). Subclass B cases (n = 12; 15%) showed shorter progression-free survival (p < 0.01). Gene expression analysis of ICMT showed key overexpressed markers in ICMT, with significant CREM overexpression regardless of fusion type, when compared to either meningioma alone, or a larger group of CNS tumors.This work provides further characterization of ICMT as an important CNS mesenchymal neoplasm that is prone to tumor recurrence, showing 2 prognostically relevant methylation subclasses, and warranting diagnostic distinction from other epigenetically and histologically related tumors.

41566895,2026-01-23,Assessment of Anesthesia Practice Patterns for Management of Neurosurgical Cases With Risk of Venous Air Embolism: An International Survey of Anesthesiologists.,"Venous air embolism (VAE) is a potentially catastrophic complication during neurosurgical procedures, particularly in the sitting position. As practices vary widely, we conducted a survey to describe the global practice patterns for intraoperative detection and management of VAE.Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, we conducted a cross-sectional study using a 48-question online survey that was distributed via a snowball sampling approach, initially to the Society of Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC) community and subsequently to international collaborators. Descriptive statistics summarized responses, and proportional comparisons between high-income and low- and middle-income country respondents were assessed using a χ2 or the Fisher exact tests, as appropriate.Of 307 responses, 297 were analyzed, representing 40 countries. Survey response rate was 25% among SNACC members. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring was the most frequently reported VAE monitoring modality, particularly for sitting craniotomies. Common barriers to implementing advanced monitoring included limited equipment availability and a lack of a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) specialist. Decision-making for cases at VAE risk relied on team consensus (62%), review articles and primary literature (48%), and institutional protocols (42%). Among respondents, 89% expressed interest in consensus guidelines for VAE management.There is substantial global variability in both the preparation for and management of VAE during neurosurgical procedures. EtCO2 is the preferred monitoring approach in routine practice, as resource limitations prevent the broader adoption of more sensitive techniques, such as TEE. The high interest in consensus guidelines underscores an opportunity for professional societies to standardize approaches and improve patient safety.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40780879,2026-01-23,American Society of Neuroradiology Consensus Statement: Integrating Neuro-PET Interpretation into Neuroradiology Training and Practice.,"Molecular imaging, particularly PET, has advanced the diagnosis and management of disease by visualizing biologic processes at a cellular and molecular level. PET imaging of the brain, spine, and head/neck, summarized under the umbrella term neuro-PET, enables noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as dementia, epilepsy, cancer, movement, or autoimmune disorders. The increasing prevalence of these conditions, as well as new treatment options necessitating response assessment, are expected to escalate neuro-PET imaging volumes, with projections for an increase in the need for specialized imaging services. This increasing clinical need highlights existing workforce shortages and underscores the need for neuroradiologists to acquire proficiency in molecular imaging. This expanded role seeks to address the growing demand. To this end, we propose a rigorous, structured, patient-centered, and collaborative framework for expanding neuroradiologists' training and practice to include neuro-PET interpretation.This American Society of Neuroradiology consensus statement outlines competency recommendations, training pathways, and implementation strategies to incorporate neuro-PET into neuroradiology practice. This approach is based on existing guidelines and was informed by survey data from neuroradiologists and molecular imaging subspecialists revealing current practice patterns and training needs. For neuroradiology fellows, structured training encompasses hands-on neuro-PET imaging experience, understanding the biologic and molecular basis of radiopharmaceuticals used in neuro-PET, and integrating molecular insights with anatomic data. Neuroradiologists beyond fellowship can undertake practice-based curriculum involving supervised case interpretation, standardized reader training courses, continuing medical education (CME), and peer review.Neuroradiologists, with their in-depth expertise of central nervous system structure and function, are well positioned to meld molecular imaging data with traditional anatomic findings. They can achieve competency and should be granted practice privileges in interpreting neuro-PET studies through a comprehensive combination of structured training, hands-on clinical experience, and documented CME hours.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41576312,2026-01-24,Safety of Intracranial Neuromodulation in Drug-Resistant Pediatric and Adult Epilepsy.,"Intracranial neuromodulation is an established therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in adults. Improving seizure outcomes and expanding its application to pediatric patients remain priorities. Off-label use of 2-lead and 4-lead devices targeting multiple network nodes, combined with varied stimulation parameters, has emerged in pursuit of better outcomes. Although early findings are promising, the safety of these approaches remains underexplored. This study evaluates adverse event (AE) rates associated with different intracranial neuromodulation devices from a single center.This retrospective study from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) included patients with DRE who underwent intracranial neuromodulation between August 2004 and December 2024. Demographic data, epilepsy characteristics, treatment indications, procedural details, and AEs were extracted from medical records. AEs are undesirable events associated with implantation and use of the device, regardless of causation. Serious AEs were life threatening or resulted in hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, or death. Patients were classified as children (<13 years), adolescents (13-18 years), or adults (≥19 years).A total of 217 patients (108 male patients, 109 female patients; 14 children, 43 adolescents, 160 adults) were analyzed. Devices included 2-lead deep brain stimulation (DBS) (111 patients), 4-lead DBS (51 patients), and responsive neurostimulation (55 patients). Device-related AEs included stimulation-related paresthesia (7.8%), infections (4.1%), asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (3.7%), bowstring effect (extension wire tethering that limits neck mobility) (3.2%), operation-related focal weakness (2.3%), wound dehiscence (1.8%), device migration (1.8%), lead malposition (1.4%), lead fracture (1.4%), lead migration (0.5%), extensor wire fracture (0.5%), extrusion (0.5%), and symptomatic ICH (0.5%). While no significant difference in overall AE rates was found between sexes, device explantation was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients (11.9% [13/109] vs 1.9% [2/108], p = 0.006). Children and patients with 4-lead DBS had a higher risk of developing bowstringing compared with other age groups and device types.Intracranial neuromodulation demonstrated an acceptable safety profile across sexes and age groups. However, children and patients with 4-lead DBS systems were at increased risk of the bowstring effect.

41577802,2026-01-24,Mobility functional status ascertainment in electronic health records using large language models.,"With global aging, assessing functional status is vital for precision medicine. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), particularly unstructured data, hold abundant information on patient mobility. This study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and standardize mobility status from unstructured EHR data (i.e., clinical notes). We annotated 600 clinical notes from three healthcare institutions located in southeastern Minnesota and west-central Wisconsin, focusing on expressions of mobility and associated impairment. Leveraging the open-source Llama 3 model, we tested various prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and task decomposition, and evaluated their performance. Error analysis showed that while the model sometimes inferred impairments without explicit evidence, most errors were clinically reasonable, often reflecting borderline or ambiguous cases. Our final model achieved a patient-level micro-average F1-score of 0.876 [95% CI 0.858-0.894] for Mobility Extraction and 0.897 [95% CI 0.878-0.917] for Impairment Classification. A secondary analysis counting ""clinically reasonable inferences"" as correct, performed to assess clinical plausibility, yielded F1-scores of 0.962 [95% CI 0.952-0.971] and 0.948 [95% CI 0.936-0.960], respectively. A local, deterministic setup improved trustworthiness by ensuring consistent outputs, safeguarding privacy, and demonstrating cross-institution generalizability.

41576384,2026-01-24,Association of standard postoperative day 1 discharge following endonasal surgery for pituitary adenoma with lower complication rates and unplanned medical care.,"Early discharge following uncomplicated endonasal resection of pituitary adenoma has been described as safe and feasible. Discharge on postoperative day (POD) 1 is not a widely implemented practice in the United States. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of routine POD1 discharges by assessing postoperative unplanned medical care rates compared with those of patients discharged on POD 2 or later (POD2+). The secondary endpoint was to identify predictors of delayed discharge in the POD2+ cohort.A retrospective database review of the medical records of 534 patients who underwent endonasal resection of pituitary adenoma at the Mayo Clinic was performed. Relevant demographics, tumor characteristics, and perioperative metrics were abstracted from the medical record, including intraoperative CSF leakage, postoperative complications, emergency department visits, or inpatient readmissions within 30 days. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed.In comparison to 422 (79%) patients discharged on POD1, 112 (21%) patients discharged on POD2+ had a higher unplanned medical care rate (13% vs 5.5%, p = 0.019). There were significantly more men in the POD1 group (48%) than in the POD2+ group (37%) (p < 0.04). The most common reasons for POD1 unplanned care were endocrine dysfunction (2.4%), split evenly between syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and adrenal insufficiency, whereas the most frequent reason in the POD2+ cohort was medical (0.06%). Univariate analyses indicated that female sex, higher BMI, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, obstructive sleep apnea, continuous positive airway pressure dependence, intraoperative CSF leakage, and diabetes insipidus (DI) increased the likelihood of POD2+ discharge. The reduced logistic regression model demonstrated a higher likelihood of POD2+ discharge with older age, ICU admission, intraoperative CSF leakage, and DI (p < 0.001). Common factors contributing to discharge after POD1 included endocrine (n = 66, 35%) and/or medical (n = 65, 34%) reasons.Routine patient discharge on POD1 following uncomplicated endonasal resection of pituitary adenoma is a safe practice, as evidenced by the significantly lower rates of unplanned medical care and complications compared with those of patients discharged on POD2 or later. Delayed discharge was associated with older age, ICU admission, intraoperative CSF leakage, and DI. The most frequent reasons for POD1 readmission were endocrine versus medical reasons for POD2+.

Sports-related injuries to these nerves can lead to significant disability and disruption to an athlete's career. 

The researchers reviewed the current state of knowledge on peripheral nerve injuries in sports, drawing insights from both medical literature and their own clinical experience. They found that while traumatic brain injuries have received substantial attention, peripheral nerve injuries are often overlooked or misdiagnosed. These nerve injuries can occur from direct trauma, compression, or stretching during athletic activities, and can affect nerves in the arms, legs, and other areas. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial, as early treatment can often restore function and allow athletes to safely return to their sport.

The objective of this study was to define MIDs to evaluate cross-sectional differences among groups and to define MICs to evaluate longitudinal within-patient changes for the Mayo Clinic Vestibular Schwannoma Quality of Life (VSQOL) Index.Anchor-based methods were used to define MIDs and MICs for the VSQOL Index domain scores, which range from 0 to 100 points, for a national cohort of 1050 patients with sporadic vestibular schwannoma, 644 of whom completed the VSQOL Index twice approximately 1 year apart.The median of the MID estimates for the VSQOL Index domains were: hearing problems (17, IQR 12.5-21); dizziness and imbalance (21, IQR 18-23); pain, discomfort, and tinnitus (19.5, IQR 15-23.5); problems with face or eyes (18, IQR 17-28); impact on physical, emotional, and social well-being (19.5, IQR 14.5-23.5); difficulty with thinking and memory (23.5, IQR 18.5-28.5); global quality of life (12, IQR 8-16); and satisfaction or regret (13.5, IQR 7-17). MIC estimates for the hearing problems and satisfaction and regret domains were not obtained because the correlations between these domain scores and their associated anchors were not sufficiently strong. The MIC estimates (minimum and maximum) for the remaining domains were: dizziness and imbalance (7.2 and 8.3); pain, discomfort, and tinnitus (8.3 and 8.5); problems with face or eyes (7.0 and 7.4); impact on physical, emotional, and social well-being (2.1 and 8.0); and difficulty with thinking and memory (12.9 and 15.0). The median of the MIC estimates for global quality of life was 5.2 (IQR 3.7-5.6).The MIDs and MICs reported herein provide a framework to interpret quality-of-life benefit or harm cross-sectionally among groups and longitudinally within patients.

For these patients, surgical intervention offers a potential path to seizure freedom. While resective surgery has been the gold standard, laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LITT versus resective surgery in patients with nontumoral epilepsy.A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, including studies comparing seizure freedom rates, complications, and procedural outcomes between LITT and open surgery in nontumoral epilepsy. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 389 LITT and 557 open surgery patients with varying epilepsy etiologies, including temporal lobe epilepsy, focal cortical dysplasia, and tuberous sclerosis. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model to assess seizure freedom, complications, and reoperation rates.Open surgery demonstrated higher rates of complete seizure freedom, although not reaching significance (68.1% vs 53.7%, RR 0.81, p = 0.07). This outcome was sensitive to influential analysis and reached significance in the epileptogenic zone-directed resection subgroup analysis. Although adequate seizure freedom was comparable between the groups (LITT: 63.0% vs open: 74.0%, RR 0.90, p = 0.11), the open surgery group had higher rates of control in the pediatric and non-temporal lobe epilepsy subgroups. Complication rates were significantly higher in the open surgery group (30.0% vs 18.3%, RR 0.55, p < 0.01). LITT patients had significantly shorter hospital stays (3.4 vs 6.8 days, standardized mean difference -0.93, p < 0.01). Reoperation rates were comparable between groups (13.1% for LITT vs 13.4%, RR 1.59, p = 0.26).While LITT offers a less invasive approach with reduced hospitalization and morbidity, open surgery remains slightly superior in achieving long-term seizure freedom.

Typical evaluations occurred over 4 to 5 days and included multimodal testing, office visits, and a weekly case conference modeled on tumor board meetings.Patients evaluated in the ADTC (N=232) ranged from 52 to 85 years of age (mean age, 71.2 years). Most patients had mild cognitive impairment (128 of 232 [55%]) or mild dementia (72 of 232 [31%]) syndromes. Overall, 121 patients (52%) were judged eligible for antiamyloid therapy. Eligibility rates were higher among internal (from our institution) referrals compared with external referrals (63% [146 of 232] vs 37% [86 of 232). Reasons for treatment ineligibility were typically multiple but commonly included magnetic resonance imaging features, too severe cognitive/functional impairment, and general health conditions believed likely to increase therapeutic risks. In some cases, the ADTC evaluation uniquely identified treatment risk factors, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, that had not been previously discussed with patients. Through shared decision making, approximately 30% of eligible patients (25 of 81) ultimately deferred antiamyloid therapy. In addition, approximately 10% of patients evaluated in the ADTC were amyloid-negative by positron emission tomography, suggesting non-Alzheimer disease diagnoses for their presentations.The ADTC facilitated systematic implementation of antiamyloid therapies for early Alzheimer disease and provided a scalable foundation for integrating future approved treatment options.Copyright © 2025 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The aortic root can sometimes become damaged or weakened, requiring surgery to prevent life-threatening complications. The researchers looked at studies that compared a minimally invasive surgical approach, which uses smaller incisions, to the traditional open-chest surgery. 

By analyzing the results from multiple previous studies, the researchers found that the minimally invasive approach had similar outcomes to the conventional surgery in terms of patient safety and recovery. Patients who underwent the minimally invasive procedure had slightly shorter hospital stays and experienced fewer complications like bleeding or infection. However, the minimally invasive approach took longer to perform and required more time on the heart-lung bypass machine.

Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is a physiological pacing approach which preserves interventricular synchrony. There is limited data regarding the success rate and outcomes of LBBAP in patients with IVSH. In this study, we aimed to synthesize all available evidence on the feasibility and outcomes of LBBAP in patients with IVSH compared to those without IVSH.We systematically reviewed bibliographic databases to identify studies published through August 2025. We included observational studies with available quantitative information on the success rate of LBBAP, lead penetration depth, paced QRS duration, and left ventricle activation time (LVAT) in patients with versus without IVSH. Estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis models and reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Three studies were included in the quantitative synthesis (49 IVSH and 701 non-IVSH patients). The pooled RR for success rate of LBBAP in IVSH patients compared to non-IVSH controls was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.82-1.04; P = 0.20). The pooled mean difference for lead penetration depth in IVSH patients compared to non-IVSH controls was 4.84 mm (95% CI = 3.86-5.82; P < 0.00001). The pooled mean difference for paced QRS duration in IVSH patients compared to non-IVSH controls was 6.66 ms (95% CI = 1.94 - 11.39; P = 0.006). The pooled mean difference for LVAT in IVSH patients compared to non-IVSH controls was 6.37 ms (95% CI = 3.07-9.67; P = 0.0002).Compared to non-IVSH patients, those with IVSH had comparable success rate of LBBAP with greater lead penetration depth, wider QRS duration, and longer LVAT.© 2026.

Twenty-four patients were included. Treatment response was defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and metabolic response on follow-up positron emission tomography scans. Survival analyses were performed from time of intrathoracic ECD diagnosis.Median age at diagnostic biopsy was 65 years (range, 43-79 years) and pleuropulmonary/mediastinal biopsy provided the first diagnosis of ECD in 77.8% of patients. Most patients (95.8%) were symptomatic. The BRAFV600E pathogenic variant or BRAF gene fusions were identified in 58.3% of patients. Common radiographic findings included ground-glass opacities (91.7%), interlobular septal thickening (79.2%), pulmonary nodules (70.8%), and pleural abnormalities (66.7% to 70.8%). Pulmonary function testing revealed predominantly restrictive patterns (40.0%). Diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide was almost always reduced (median: 56.5% of predicted; range, 25.0% to 106.0%). Complete response was 10.5%, partial response was 10.5%, and objective response rate was 21.0%. Stable disease and progressive disease were noted in 57.9% and 21.1%, respectively. Median overall survival was 10.9 years (95% CI, 5.5-undefined) and estimated 5-year survival was 85.0%.Erdheim-Chester disease causes symptomatic pleuropulmonary disease, which may be the initial presenting feature. Erdheim-Chester disease characteristically manifests interlobular septal thickening with ground-glass and/or small nodular opacities, often combined with pleural thickening and/or pleural effusions.

Social determinants of health (SDoH) are important to consider when examining this treatment gap. This study examined the potential systemic inequities at three different stages in the journey toward epilepsy surgery across the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC).Any youth in the PERC prospective surgery database (≤18 years) was eligible and included if sociodemographic factors were also available. We examined if there were differences in disparity factors in: (1) referral to Phase I evaluation, (2) offering of surgery, and (3) completion of surgery.Of 1309 patients, the majority were male (53%, p = .04), White (82.2%, p < .001), not Hispanic or Latino (84.3%, p < .001), and privately insured (56.3%, p < .001). Of the youth who were offered surgical treatment (n = 1103, 84.3%), there were no significant differences in race/ethnicity or sex. Those with a structural lesion were more likely to be offered surgery, and historically marginalized youth were more likely to have a lesion. Of patients who completed surgery (n = 927, 84.0%), White patients were 1.88 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.04) more likely than Black patients to complete surgery (p = .01).Youth who began surgery evaluation are not representative of the demographics of those with epilepsy in the United States, with greater representation of White, non-Hispanic male individuals. In addition, youth who began surgery evaluation disproportionally have private insurance. At the next stage of offering surgery, there were no differences based on SDoH. However, there is evidence that underrepresented youth that were magnetic resonance negative were less likely to be referred for surgical workup and that Black youth were less likely to undergo surgery. Therefore, efforts to provide equitable opportunity for all youth with refractory epilepsy should be concentrated at the referral for surgery evaluation point of care; however, additional efforts are also needed at later stages.© 2026 International League Against Epilepsy.",Epilepsia,"Jan 24, 2026",2026.0,Jan,24.0,Madison M Berl|Janelle Wagner|Avery Caraway|Hayley Loblein|Edward J Novotny|Kristina Patrick|Adam P Ostendorf|Allyson L Alexander|Krista L Eschbach|Dewi F Depositario-Cabacar|Thuy-Anh A Vu|Chima Oluigbo|Samir R Karia|Cemal Karakas|Lily C Wong-Kisiel|Erin F Romanowski|Nancy A McNamara|Jeffrey Bolton|Alyssa Ailion|Priyamvada Tatachar|Pilar D Pichon|Daniel W Shrey|Rani K Singh|Jason Coryell|Jenny J Lin|Jennifer Koop|Ernesto Gonzalez-Giraldo|Kurtis Auguste|Danilo Bernardo|Michael A Ciliberto|Shilpa B Reddy|Abhinaya Ganesh|Kristen Arredondo|Zachary Grinspan|Srishti Nangia|Debopam Samanta|Ahmad Marashly|Dallas Armstrong|M S Perry,Lily C Wong-Kisiel,"Center for Neuroscience, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.|College of Nursing, Department of Pediatrics, & Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.|Jane and John Justin Institute for Mind Health, Cook Children's Medical Center, TX, USA.|Departments of Neurology and Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.|Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.|Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.|Department of Neurology, Lurie Children's Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA.|Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, CA, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Atrium Health, Levine Children's Hospital, Charlotte, NC, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.|Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA.|Departments of Neurology & Neuropsychology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.|Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.|Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.|Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.|Departments of Pediatrics and Neurology, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA.","Madison M Berl, Janelle Wagner, Avery Caraway, Hayley Loblein, Edward J Novotny, Kristina Patrick, Adam P Ostendorf, Allyson L Alexander, Krista L Eschbach, Dewi F Depositario-Cabacar, Thuy-Anh A Vu, Chima Oluigbo, Samir R Karia, Cemal Karakas, Lily C Wong-Kisiel, Erin F Romanowski, Nancy A McNamara, Jeffrey Bolton, Alyssa Ailion, Priyamvada Tatachar, Pilar D Pichon, Daniel W Shrey, Rani K Singh, Jason Coryell, Jenny J Lin, Jennifer Koop, Ernesto Gonzalez-Giraldo, Kurtis Auguste, Danilo Bernardo, Michael A Ciliberto, Shilpa B Reddy, Abhinaya Ganesh, Kristen Arredondo, Zachary Grinspan, Srishti Nangia, Debopam Samanta, Ahmad Marashly, Dallas Armstrong, M S Perry",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579031/,"This research examined disparities in the pediatric epilepsy surgery process, which involves evaluating and treating children with severe, drug-resistant seizures through surgery.

To date, studies have been retrospective or conducted in a single center. The primary aim of this international cohort study was to prospectively determine the incidence of patient-reported pain during cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia.Over 8 weeks, a multicenter cohort study was conducted in 15 centers across the United States and Canada. All patients who underwent cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia were surveyed on postpartum day 1 regarding the presence of intraoperative pain and were asked to grade their pain using a numeric rating score (0 to 10) and rate their satisfaction (yes or no) with their pain management.A total of 3,693 patients were included in the analysis. An overall incidence of patient-reported pain during cesarean delivery was 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8 to 8.5%) with 282 of 3,693 patients reporting pain. In patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery, intraoperative pain was reported in 3.7% (95% CI, 2.7 to 5.0%) with spinal, 9.2% (95% CI, 6.7 to 12.2%) with combined spinal-epidural, and 12.2% (95% CI, 4.1 to 26.2%) with epidural top-up anesthesia. In the non-elective setting, pain was more commonly reported by patients: 5.7% (95% CI, 4.0 to 7.8%) with spinal, 7.1% (95% CI, 4.7 to 10.1%) with combined spinal-epidural, 8.0% (95% CI, 2.2 to 19.2%) with dural puncture epidural, and 13.2% (95% CI, 11.1 to 15.5%) with epidural top-up anesthesia. Patients who had intraoperative pain reported a median (interquartile range) numeric rating score of 6 (4 to 8) out of 10.

41581128,2026-01-26,Navigating Faculty Coaching: A Framework of Key Considerations.,"Coaching is considered the next generation of professional development in academic medicine, building on the historically important roles of advisor, mentor, and sponsor. A growing number of organizations are exploring or currently utilizing coaching to support their employees and/or learners. Positive impressions of coaching have contributed to its ubiquitous use. However, to avoid confusion about the aim, approach, and outcomes of coaching, a thorough stakeholder analysis, an intentional organizational design, and a sustainable execution plan are necessary. Faculty and workforce coaching programs are distinct from learner coaching. Workplace coaching has pivoted from a disciplinary, problem-based reaction to a proactive investment in top performers. Coaching has also broadened beyond the C-suite, as a meaningful investment across all workforce layers. A coaching relationship helps high-achieving faculty elevate or sustain performance by having a thinking partner to reflect on situations, values, or vision; analyze and build awareness of needs or gaps; investigate impact factors of actions or inactions; strategize goals, priorities, and timelines; and evaluate decisions and options. Offering coaching as part of contemporary benefits packages signals career-long organizational interest in supporting talent. Coaching for faculty is a versatile and personalized approach to professional development and can be achieved through individualized, group, online, and in-person interactions. Key considerations for planning, launching, redesigning or evaluating a faculty coaching program are outlined, including expected faculty consumers, stakeholder concerns, access, benefits, goals, and outcomes of coaching within an academic medicine environment.© The Author(s) 2026.

This study aimed to investigate prognostic factors affecting survival in grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma.In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of patients diagnosed with grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma between 2002 and 2023 across all 3 Mayo Clinic campuses who received standard radiation/temozolomide were reviewed. Clinical, radiographic, and molecular variables collected included age, sex, midline involvement (infiltration of brainstem, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, corpus callosum), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletion. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression.Fifty-eight patients were identified (median age: 36 years, 36% female). The median PFS and OS were 2.4 and 6.9 years, respectively. CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion reduced PFS (1.4 vs 4.5 years, hazard ratio [HR] 4.9, 95% CI 2.1-11, p < 0.001) and OS (2.5 vs not reached [NR], HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.3-12, p = 0.018). Midline involvement also reduced PFS (1.4 vs 4.5 years, HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8-11, p < 0.001) and OS (2.4 vs 13 years, HR 8.7, 95% CI 2.4-32, p = 0.001). MGMT promoter hypermethylation improved PFS (4.6 vs 1.3 years, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.037-0.63, p = 0.009). Multivariable analyses revealed that PFS remained significantly reduced by CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion (HR 4.2, 95% CI 1.7-10, p = 0.002) and midline involvement (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-6.4, p = 0.045). A significant association between CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion and midline involvement was observed (χ2 = 4.3, p = 0.037). Exploratory analyses revealed that all patients with midline involvement demonstrated aberration in retinoblastoma signaling. CDKN2A/B hemizygous deletion/loss of heterozygosity also reduced OS (2.5 years vs NR, HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.0-23, p = 0.044).CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion and midline involvement independently reduce PFS in patients with grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma treated with standard radiation/temozolomide.

41582723,2026-01-27,Medial meniscus posterior root tears: A narrative review on the relationship and implications of meniscus extrusion.,"Medial meniscus extrusion, particularly in the setting of medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRTs), has become an area of interest in recent years due to the correlation between meniscus extrusion with inferior clinical outcomes, progression to osteoarthritis, and increased rate of conversion to total knee arthroplasty after MMPRT repair. This correlation led to the development of meniscus centralisations procedures that can be performed in addition to MMPRT repair and/or high tibial osteotomy. Although it was originally thought that medial meniscus extrusion was a consequence of MMPRTs, it has been reported that meniscus extrusion often precedes the development of MMPRTs, which suggests that there may be underlying meniscus pathology that predisposes to the development of both meniscus extrusion and MMPRTs. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the anatomy, pathology, and surgical management of meniscus extrusion and MMPRTs, while identifying areas of future research to further elucidate the relationship meniscus extrusion and MMPRTs that may be necessary to improve outcomes after MMPRT repair.

They found that meniscus extrusion is often seen alongside MMPRT, and that it is linked to poorer outcomes for patients, including increased risk of developing osteoarthritis and needing total knee replacement surgery. Interestingly, the data suggests that meniscus extrusion can actually precede the development of MMPRT, implying there may be underlying issues that make the meniscus more prone to both extrusion and tearing.

41582311,2026-01-27,Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction in Cardiovascular Disease: Diagnosis and Management.,"Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is increasingly recognized as a central mechanism underlying myocardial ischemia, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without obstructive coronary artery disease. The coronary microcirculation plays a critical role in regulating myocardial perfusion through tightly coordinated myogenic, metabolic, and endothelial pathways. Disruption of these mechanisms results in impaired vasodilatory capacity, abnormal coronary flow reserve, and microvascular ischemia. This review summarizes the anatomy and physiology of coronary microcirculation and examines the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving CMD, including endothelial dysfunction, structural remodeling, inflammation, and neurohormonal dysregulation. Contemporary diagnostic strategies are reviewed, with emphasis on invasive coronary function testing and advanced noninvasive imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical implications of CMD across diverse disease states, including ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries, heart failure, and cardiomyopathies, are discussed. Finally, current therapeutic approaches, prognostic considerations, and emerging research directions aimed at improving diagnosis and targeted treatment of CMD are highlighted.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Histologic fibrosis is a hallmark of late-stage CP, but non-invasive methods to evaluate fibrosis progression are limited. We utilized urine proteomics to discover biomarkers that identify patients with CP and predict fibrosis severity.We performed a cross-sectional study of 130 total subjects (CP n=50) selected based on clinical criteria in a tertiary care setting. Urine proteomics samples were quantified using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Differential biomarker candidates were identified with false discovery rate (FDR) corrected pairwise comparisons. These proteins were validated with an independent paired urine and plasma sample cohort (n=36). Machine learning was used to develop a protein panel that predicted Ammann scores for patients with histologic fibrosis.We found 34 proteins consistently differentially expressed between CP and controls in pairwise FDR-controlled tests. Of these, 25 urine proteins outperformed 19 previously suggested CP blood-based biomarkers in an independent validation cohort. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (1DH1), Calcyphosin (CAPS), Synuclein Gamma (SNCG), and Protein S100-P (S100P) all produced receiver operator curve area under the curve (ROC-AUC) values >0.95, while the best plasma marker was Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Alpha (IL2RA, ROC-AUC=0.80). A twelve-protein panel of identified markers predicted fibrosis severity with a linear correlation R2 value of 0.61.We identified a panel of proteins that may diagnose CP in children and developed a model to predict pancreatic fibrosis severity, offering promising tools for improving diagnostics and patient care.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

41603030,2026-01-29,Gain-of-Function Variant TRPC6 A404V Is Associated With Doxorubicin-Related Cardiomyopathy.,"TRPC6 (transient receptor potential canonical 6) channels, encoded by the TRPC6 gene, are widely expressed in cardiomyocytes and play a critical role in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Variants in TRPC6 are associated with chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy. Specifically, the TRPC6 A404V polymorphism, with a minor (404 V) allele frequency of 12% in the general population, has been identified in patients undergoing anthracycline therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored.Using patch-clamp recordings, Ca2+ imaging, computational analysis, and molecular biology techniques, we assessed the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite, doxorubicinol, on regulating TRPC6 alanine (A) at position 404 replaced by valine (V; A404V) channel expression and function in a heterologous expression system and native cardiac cells.Both additive and recessive models demonstrated a significant association between the TRPC6 A404V variant and doxorubicin-related cardiomyopathy. The TRPC6 A404V channel exhibited higher membrane expression levels compared with the wild-type (WT) control. Patch-clamp recordings showed that both TRPC6 WT and A404V channels remained mostly inactive at baseline. Application of 50 μmol/L 1-oleoyl acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a TRPC6 activator, significantly increased the inward- and outward-current densities of WT and A404V channels. Furthermore, a 24-hour treatment with 0.5 μmol/L doxorubicin enhanced TRPC6 mRNA expression and potentiated the OAG effects on both WT and A404V channels, with a more pronounced response in A404V channels. Treatment with 0.5 μmol/L doxorubicinol had no effect on OAG-induced current densities in either WT or A404V channels. Doxorubicin effects on intracellular Ca2+ levels were confirmed by Ca2+ imaging in native cardiac cells. Computational modeling revealed that the A404V mutation induces a conformational change in the OAG-binding pocket, enhancing its interaction with OAG in the A404V protein compared with the WT control.The TRPC6 A404V is a gain-of-function variant that exhibits enhanced activity in the presence of doxorubicin.

We tested ANPEP and PIGR, along with prior data for thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), in retrospective phase II studies using separate cohorts of PDAC plasmas at different stages versus healthy or nonmalignant disease controls (DC) from Penn (n = 135) and Mayo (n = 537).Comparing healthy controls with stage I/II PDAC, we obtained area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-0.86]/0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85; ANPEP) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.88)/0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.90; PIGR) for the Penn/Mayo phase II studies, respectively. In multivariable models, CA19-9/THBS2/ANPEP, CA19-9/THBS2/PIGR, and CA19-9/THBS2/ANPEP/PIGR elicited AUC of 0.94 to 0.96 for Penn and 0.97 for Mayo.

Contemporary guidelines increasingly recommend early use of combination therapy, recognizing that most patients require multiple agents to achieve target blood pressure. Widaplik, a recently Food and Drug Administration-approved fixed-dose, single-pill triple combination of telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide, represents the first triple therapy approved for initial treatment of hypertension in adults likely to need multidrug therapy. This review summarizes the pharmacologic rationale for low-dose triple therapy, highlighting complementary mechanisms targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vascular resistance, and sodium retention. We examine evidence from pivotal phase 3 trials demonstrating rapid, sustained blood pressure reductions, higher control rates compared with dual therapy, and favorable tolerability. We also discuss safety considerations, practical limitations, and gaps in evidence, including long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Widaplik represents a paradigm shift toward simplified, early combination therapy aimed at improving hypertension control and reducing cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Participants were recruited through 6 of the organization's 41 Employee Resource Groups, open to all regardless of background and including participants diverse in race and ethnicity, gender and sexual identity, veteran status, and physical ability. Focus groups were held between September 2022 and December 2023. Discussions were facilitated by trained interviewers using a semi-structured guide about experiences of racism, workplace culture, and perceptions of inclusion resources. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and de-identified. Transcripts were coded independently by two researchers using iterative thematic analysis with a shared codebook. Coding discrepancies were resolved by consensus.A total of 42 healthcare workers participated in eight focus groups. A prominent theme was the prevalence of discriminatory experiences faced by participants. Several themes emerged: (1) the need for tangible institutional change alongside structured emotional support; (2) underutilization of support resources due to limited representation; (3) the central role of leadership in shaping a healthy workplace culture; and (4) the need for educational initiatives.Findings from this study highlight that discrimination remains a persistent challenge for healthcare workers, despite the presence of institutional inclusion initiatives.

A machine learning model was constructed on ARM/BET data. BET was weight-based in 235 patients and time-based in 72 patients. Missing data were imputed. Data were split 75% train/25% test with preprocessing performed. Five common ML models were trained, and performance was compared using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy based on 100 bootstrapped samples. The most accurate models were fine-tuned and evaluated on the test set.The median age was 40 years, BMI 22.2 kg/m2, and 81% were female. Two-hundred and twenty-two (72.3%) patients had a clinical diagnosis of DD.

However, a major limitation of unbiased approaches is missing data, which worsens as the sample size increases. In addition, the reproducible measurement of post-translational modifications (PTMs) at the single cell level, particularly those present at a lower stoichiometry than their unmodified counterparts, poses an even greater challenge. To overcome this limitation, we developed a targeted strategy that combines tandem mass tag (TMT) multiplexing with SureQuant-based triggered MS/MS using super heavy TMT-labeled peptides that are 9 Da heavier than the TMTpro tags as triggers. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we established a method quantifying four PTMs on the histone H3 protein (i.e., K14ac, K23ac, K27me, K27me3, and K79me) at single-cell resolution. We demonstrated robustness in quantitation compared to conventional approaches of data-dependent acquisition and standard parallel reaction monitoring. Further, we applied this strategy to single cells and revealed cellular heterogeneity in histone PTMs. Overall, we developed a targeted strategy with improved sensitivity and throughput for analyzing PTMs in single cells, which we expect will be broadly applicable to multiple types of PTMs while enabling focused analysis.",Journal of proteome research,"Jan 27, 2026",2026.0,Jan,27.0,Dong-Gi G Mun|Hiroshi Nishida|Firdous A Bhat|Raghavendra R Pasupuleti|Bernard Delanghe|Akhilesh Pandey,Dong-Gi G Mun|Hiroshi Nishida|Firdous A Bhat|Raghavendra R Pasupuleti|Akhilesh Pandey,"Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, United States.|Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28199 Bremen, Germany.|Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.|Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, United States.","Dong-Gi G Mun, Hiroshi Nishida, Firdous A Bhat, Raghavendra R Pasupuleti, Bernard Delanghe, Akhilesh Pandey",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41591392/,"This research addresses an important challenge in studying how cells function at the molecular level.

41589835,2026-01-29,Current understanding of mitral valve prolapse syndrome and related arrhythmia: State-of-the-Art Review.,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common cause of primary (degenerative) mitral regurgitation and represents a heterogeneous disease spectrum with generally benign prognosis but potentially serious complications. Advances in imaging have refined diagnostic criteria, reducing historical overdiagnosis and clarifying the morphologic continuum from fibroelastic deficiency to extensive myxomatous degeneration (Barlow's disease). Beyond mitral regurgitation and infective endocarditis, a small but clinically important subset of patients is at increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, giving rise to the concept of arrhythmogenic MVP. This phenotype is characterized by a combination of clinical, anatomical, myocardial, and electrical features rather than a single abnormality. Key associated findings include bileaflet prolapse, female sex, electrocardiographic repolarization changes, frequent or complex ventricular ectopy, myocardial fibrosis detectable by cardiac magnetic resonance, abnormal tissue Doppler signals, and mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD, including both true MAD and the more common pseudo-MAD, contributes to excessive mobility of the mitral valve apparatus, abnormal systolic annular motion (""curling""), and repetitive mechanical stress on the papillary muscles and inferobasal left ventricular myocardium, promoting fibrosis and arrhythmogenesis. Importantly, arrhythmic risk may persist even after surgical correction of mitral regurgitation, likely due to established myocardial substrate. Contemporary registry data confirm the heterogeneity of MVP and suggest that true primary arrhythmogenic MVP is relatively uncommon but identifiable using detailed echocardiographic and electrocardiographic assessment. Overall, arrhythmogenic MVP should be viewed as a syndrome spanning a spectrum from benign to malignant, underscoring the need for integrated risk stratification and targeted follow-up.

However, its utility in sepsis, particularly when combined with lactate clearance (LA clearance), has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we examined the dynamic role of MELD-LA with 24-hour LA clearance as a predictor of 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and sepsis.We analyzed cirrhosis patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU in a large U.S. healthcare system (20 hospitals) from 2014-2022, examining MELD-LA and LA clearance within 24 hours as predictors of 30-day mortality. We externally validated our findings in the APASL-ACLF Research Consortium, a multinational Asian cohort (31 centers) from 2009-2019.A total of 3,879 cirrhosis patients with sepsis were admitted to the ICU (43.2% female, 20.5% Hispanic, 12.4% on dialysis; mean initial LA 4.5 mmol/L, MELD 20.8, MELD-LA 17.6). Survivors showed a median lactate change of -1.04 (35% clearance) compared to -0.4 (12%) for non-survivors. LA clearance within 24 hours was influenced by the presenting MELD-LA. In the North American cohort, ≥35% LA clearance was associated with improved 30-day survival (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.53; p<0.001). Similarly, in the APASL cohort (n=1,259), ≥35% clearance was linked to a 60% reduction in mortality (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.62; p<0.001). When stratified by LA clearance, patients with LA clearance of ≥35% had a higher percentage of early administration of resuscitative measures than those with LA clearance of < 10% especially with regards to early antibiotic administration (82.5% vs 67.6%; p-value <0.001).Early reduction in initial LA by one-third predicts 30-day mortality and may indicate treatment response in cirrhosis patients with sepsis in the ICU.

This research paper examines a serious lung condition called pulmonary hypertension, where high blood pressure in the lungs can lead to heart failure. The researchers focused on a rapidly progressing form of this disease, which is particularly dangerous and difficult to treat. 

The study looked at the distribution and patterns of blood vessel damage in the lungs of patients with this rapidly worsening pulmonary hypertension. The researchers used advanced imaging tests to map out the extent and location of the vascular disease in the lungs. They compared these findings to patients with more slowly progressing pulmonary hypertension.

The key discovery was that the rapidly progressive form of the disease showed a distinct ""patchy"" pattern of vascular damage, rather than the more uniform distribution seen in slower-moving cases. This suggests the rapid progression may be driven by specific areas of the lungs being more severely affected. 

These insights could help doctors better identify and monitor high-risk",Cardiology,

41591418,2026-01-29,Clinical Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic kidney disorder leading to kidney failure. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the diagnosis, risk stratification, management, and prognostication in ADPKD by enabling more accurate assessments and individualized care. AI-powered imaging tools enhance the measurement of total kidney volume (TKV), improving the precision and efficiency of monitoring disease progression and more reliable assessment of therapeutic response. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can integrate genetic, imaging, and clinical data to predict kidney function decline, facilitating personalized treatment strategies. In addition, AI is being used to identify genetic variants and to refine genotype-phenotype relationships, offering deeper insights into disease variability. AI-enabled monitoring technologies can support longitudinal tracking of TKV measurements obtained through MRI or CT, thereby improving clinical decision-making and management. Furthermore, AI can optimize clinical trial design by improving patient selection, prediction of treatment responses, and safety monitoring. Despite these promising developments, integrating AI into the clinical practice remains controversial and may pose several challenges. This review highlights the emerging clinical applications of AI in ADPKD, emphasizing its potential to advance precision medicine and improve patient outcomes.© The Author(s) 2026.

Correlation analyses evaluated relationships between standard 2D parameters (Cobb angles, thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL)) and transverse plane indices (ORPD, AVR). The distribution of ORPD and AVR subclasses was examined, as well as the associations between conventional Lenke lumbar and thoracic sagittal profile modifiers, and their corresponding 3D transverse plane modifiers. Complementary analyses also included 3D displacement of the apex relative to the end-vertebrae line (DAEVL).Nearly all ORPD-AVR subclass combinations were observed across regions, confirming the system's ability to capture diverse deformity patterns. ORPD and AVR were independent in PT and MT but correlated in TL/L (r = 0.69). Cobb angle correlated moderately with ORPD in MT (r = 0.43) and strongly in TL/L (r = 0.67), while correlations with AVR were moderate in MT (r = 0.50) and TL/L (r = 0.59). TK correlated negatively with MT ORPD (r = -0.58), whereas LL showed no association with TL/L ORPD. DAEVL correlated strongly with Cobb across all regions but only weakly to moderately with ORPD. Associations between Lenke 2D modifiers and ORPD were strong in TL/L (V = 0.59) and moderate in MT (V = 0.37). Multivariate models showed that Cobb and TK explained ~ 44% of MT ORPD variance, while > 55% of ORPD variability across regions remained unexplained by 2D parameters.ORPD and AVR provide complementary, region-specific 3D information beyond conventional 2D measures and Lenke modifiers.

Hyperoxia induces oxidant-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary cell death, called hyperoxic ALI (HALI). Elucidating molecular mechanisms in HALI could identify therapeutic targets in ALI.In the current study, we examined in vivo effects of HALI on Beclin-1 (BCN1), which regulates autophagy, and modulation of BCN1 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Effects of HALI on BCN1 and autophagy were examined in mice with genetically decreased EGFR (EGFRWa5/+). Wildtype (WT) and EGFRWa5/+ mice were exposed to 100% oxygen for 24-72 hours along with normoxia controls (eight groups; n=4-6/group), and analysis of pulmonary BCN1 and autophagy was completed.In WT, HALI led to increased BCN1 (59% increased total BCN1/β-Actin; p<0.01) in lung and alveolar epithelium (484% increased H-score; p<0.001). HALI led to decreased microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain (LC3B)-II/-I ratios (43% decrease; p<0.05) and increased p62 (93% increase; p<0.05), suggesting reduced autophagic flux. In human alveolar type-II cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (AT2siPSC), HALI caused increased LDH release (130% increase; p<0.0001) and decreased LC3B-II/-I ratios (32% decrease; p<0.05). We previously showed that EGFRWa5/+ mice are protected in HALI. In the current study, EGFRWa5/+ mice showed increased pulmonary BCN1 (122% increase; p<0.05), reduced phosphorylated-(p-)/total BCN1 (47% decrease; p<0.05) and decreased LC3B-II/-I ratios (70% decrease; p<0.01) in HALI compared with WT. In addition, wortmannin (1 mg/kg), which decreases BCN1-mediated autophagy, increased mortality in HALI compared with vehicle control (n=10/group; 18% decreased hours survived; p<0.001).These data delineate a novel cell death pathway in HALI involving BCN1 and EGFR with therapeutic potential.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

41592868,2026-01-29,American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2026 Guidelines on Diagnosis of Light Chain Amyloidosis.,"Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the misfolding of immunoglobulin light chains produced by a plasma cell dyscrasia. Patients can present with involvement of many organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, nerves and other sites, resulting in a high symptom burden. Timely and accurate diagnosis is important to prevent organ failure and improve patient survival. These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients and clinicians in the timely and effective diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 22 individuals representing various medical specialties (academic/community hematology, nephrology, neurology, cardiology, internal medicine and pathology) as well as one patient representative. The group was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. Kansas University Medical Center supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 6th of March 2023). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. The panel agreed on 12 recommendations. The use of serum immunofixation, urine immunofixation and serum free light chains enhances the clinical suspicion of AL amyloidosis. The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis can be made effectively through surrogate biopsies which require both a bone marrow biopsy and fat pad sampling However, target organ biopsies maybe favoured in certain clinical situations.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Jan 27, 2026",2026.0,Jan,27.0,Vishal Kukreti|Matthew D Seftel|Maria A Aguirre|Muayad Azzam|Deborah Boedicker|Naresh Bumma|Antonia S Carroll|Raymond Comenzo|Joselle Cook|Noel R Dasgupta|Alfredo De La Torre|Angela Dispenzieri|Faizi Jamal|Hassan Kawtharany|Jack Khouri|Nelson Leung|Jamil Nazzal|Maria M Picken|Shahzad Raza|Vaishali Sanchorawala|Nitasha Sarswat|Hira Shaikh|Daulath Singh|Reem A Mustafa,Joselle Cook|Angela Dispenzieri|Nelson Leung,"Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Canadian Blood Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.|Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, BUENOS AIRES, Argentina.|University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, United States.|Mackenzie's Mission, Reston, Virginia, United States.|Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States.|St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States.|NSHA, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.|City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, United States.|Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States.|University of Kansas Medical Center, Dalton, Georgia, United States.|Loyola University Medical Centre, Maywood, Illinois, United States.|Cleveland Clinic , Lerner College of Medicine, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, United States.|Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States.|University of Iowa Healthcare, Iowa City, Iowa, United States.|The Iowa Clinic PC, Iowa, Iowa, United States.","Vishal Kukreti, Matthew D Seftel, Maria A Aguirre, Muayad Azzam, Deborah Boedicker, Naresh Bumma, Antonia S Carroll, Raymond Comenzo, Joselle Cook, Noel R Dasgupta, Alfredo De La Torre, Angela Dispenzieri, Faizi Jamal, Hassan Kawtharany, Jack Khouri, Nelson Leung, Jamil Nazzal, Maria M Picken, Shahzad Raza, Vaishali Sanchorawala, Nitasha Sarswat, Hira Shaikh, Daulath Singh, Reem A Mustafa",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41592868/,"Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare but serious condition where misfolded proteins build up in the body's organs, leading to organ damage and failure.

Here, we evaluated anastrozole in combination with palbociclib (ANA/PAL) in the NeoPalAna Endocrine-Resistant cohort (NCT01723774). Thirty-four patients with clinical stage II/III ER + /HER2- BCs resistant to standard neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (on-treatment Ki67 > 10%) received neoadjuvant ANA/PAL, with serial biopsies analyzed. The primary endpoint, complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA; Ki67C1D15 ≤ 2.7% at cycle 1, day 15), was achieved in 57.6% of patients (95%CI: 39.2-74.5%). Resistance to ANA/PAL (Ki67C1D15 > 10%) was associated with higher pre-treatment tumor grade, Ki67, and specific PAM50 subtypes. Resistant tumors demonstrated reduced ER signaling and upregulation of cell cycle, mTOR, interferon, JAK/STAT, and immune checkpoints. Additionally, a 33-gene signature that predicted neoadjuvant Ki67 response to ANA/PAL was prognostic in a metastatic validation cohort. These findings underscore dysregulated oncogenic pathways as potential resistance mechanisms and biomarkers of response to CDK4/6i.© 2026.

41593274,2026-01-29,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Axillary Management Options at the Time of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy.,"The historical standard for axillary management after occult malignancy identified at the time of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, the optimal strategy for managing the axilla in patients undergoing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is unknown. Herein, we evaluate the cost effectiveness of the possible strategies.A decision tree was constructed with event probabilities from a literature review. Cost data were obtained from the Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to determine expected costs, number of sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgeries in the absence of occult malignancy, number of ALND avoided, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each of the approaches.Routine SLN surgery increased costs by $US12,151.90 and resulted in 985 unnecessary SLN surgeries per 1000 patients but no diagnostic ALND. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging increased costs by $2065.26, required no unnecessary SLN surgeries, and a rare need for ALND. Routine SLN mapping for delayed SLN surgery increased costs by $269.22 and required no unnecessary SLN surgeries or diagnostic ALND.Difference in cost (excluding routine SLN surgery) was only a small proportion of the overall cost, whereas there was a wide range in excess SLN surgeries and ALND. Thus, cost should not be a primary driver of decision-making in this scenario. It is therefore important to focus on the relative risks of excess SLN surgery and diagnostic ALND, which are minimized by routine SLN mapping for delayed SLN surgery and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.© 2026.

41593595,2026-01-29,Food insecurity and gender-based violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.,"Gender-based violence (GBV) and food insecurity are conditions that affect women and may also exacerbate each other, as women experience disproportionately higher levels of both globally. Both of these conditions also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe how the association between food insecurity and GBV across multiple global regions during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted women. The review aims to inform equity-driven interventions and policy development in the event for use during future emergency crises.The social-ecological model (SEM) and the intersectionality framework were the frameworks used for this systematic review. The PRISMA guidelines guided this systematic review methodology. The literature search was conducted using the APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases in November 2025. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) studies that assessed the association between food insecurity and GBV among women during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The exclusion criterion was any study that was not primary research. The Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSDD) was used for quality appraisal. Thematic analysis, guided by Hennink and colleagues (2020), was used to synthesize the results.Thirty-two studies were included in the data analysis. At the individual level, food insecurity and GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with a greater likelihood of reporting mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, being an immigrant was associated with a high risk of experiencing food insecurity and GBV. At the relationship level, food insecurity and GBV were associated with household instability and family dysfunction. At the community level, the association was influenced by poverty and limited employment opportunities. At the societal level, restrictive COVID-19 policies and prevailing cultural norms contributed to intensifying food insecurity and GBV.This study offers support for strengthening crisis‒response systems across socio-ecological levels that incorporate gender-sensitive food security and violence prevention strategies during public health emergencies. New policies are needed to create effective support systems to promote women's health, especially marginalized groups, who experience the greatest vulnerability.© 2026.

By the time patients are diagnosed, irreversible organ impairment from amyloid deposition has occurred, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality. While developing the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines on systemic amyloidosis, we identified a critical knowledge gap in the recognition of the clinical presentation of its most common subtypes. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of 117 studies following PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify clinical ""red flags"" for light chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTRwt, ATTRv) amyloidosis. Studies were identified from the comprehensive systematic review through the ASH amyloidosis diagnosis guideline panel, data mining, and grey literature review. Data were extracted and synthesized by systems to characterize the earliest and most frequently overlooked clinical red flags for the different types of amyloidosis. Shortness of breath and fatigue, the earliest symptoms of AL amyloidosis, contrast with the carpal tunnel syndrome occurring years before ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis is diagnosed. Weight loss, unexplained abdominal pain, and early satiety were overlooked red flags for AL amyloidosis, compared to the preceding arrhythmias often missed in evaluation for ATTRwt amyloidosis. Sensory loss was the predominant neuropathic presentation for AL amyloidosis compared to the painful length-dependent neuropathy of ATTRv amyloidosis.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at 16 weeks was the primary endpoint. Those who achieved HiSCR switched to open-label low-dose vilobelimab; those who did not were switched to medium-dose vilobelimab. The trial was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT number 2017-004501-40) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03487276).The study did not meet the primary endpoint, perhaps due, in part, to an unexpectedly high HiSCR placebo response rate of 47.1%.

On the basis of preclinical and clinical data, the addition of palbociclib (a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6) may overcome resistance to both endocrine and HER2-directed therapies.In this phase 3, open-label, randomized trial, we enrolled patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who did not have disease progression after four to eight cycles of chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive maintenance HER2-targeted and endocrine therapies with or without palbociclib. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response, clinical benefit, safety, and overall survival.A total of 518 patients underwent randomization: 261 were assigned to receive palbociclib and 257 to receive standard therapy. At a median follow-up of 53.5 months, patients in the palbociclib group had significantly longer progression-free survival than those in the standard-therapy group (median duration, 44.3 months vs. 29.1 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.96; two-sided P = 0.02). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, predominantly from neutropenia, occurred in 79.7% and 10.0% of the patients, respectively, in the palbociclib group, as compared with 30.6% and 3.6% of the patients, respectively, in the standard-therapy group.The addition of palbociclib to maintenance anti-HER2 and endocrine therapies led to a significant improvement in progression-free survival over standard therapy, with increased toxic effects, mainly neutropenia.

This rare but high-risk scenario, coupled with fear of radiation, has created ambiguity in the ideal management of pregnant patients. Without a comprehensive guide for the use of radiation in imaging and treatment for pregnant cancer patients, it is difficult for providers to provide optimal patient-centered care without introducing disparities. The goal of this paper is to provide guidance on the use of radiation for screening, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of cancer, while highlighting gaps in existing knowledge and guidelines. The intention is that physicians, medical physicists, and patients could use this document as a resource for shared decision-making, ensuring safe and effective practice.A team of physicians and medical physicists with expertise in imaging, radiotherapy, and maternal fetal medicine was assembled, along with a patient advocate and lawyer. Existing guidelines and recent literature were reviewed. Authors also drew from their experience where published guidance was lacking.The resulting document discusses best practice to guide use of radiation for cancer, as well as patient-centered care management and legal considerations.It is possible to safely and effectively deliver radiation to pregnant patients in numerous circumstances. Use of radiation or other modalities should be discussed through shared decision-making with the physician and patient, contextualizing the maternal and fetal risk from treatments.

The efficacy and safety of inclisiran versus placebo in patients without and with CKD were investigated in a post hoc pooled analysis of three Phase 3 trials (ORION-9, ORION-10, ORION-11).Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or its risk equivalent, and elevated LDL cholesterol were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous inclisiran or placebo on days 1, 90, and every six months thereafter for 540 days. Patients were stratified based on baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation): ≥90, 60-˂90, 45-˂60, and 15-<45 mL/min/1.73m2. Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in LDL cholesterol at day 510, and time-adjusted percentage change after day 90 and through day 540. Safety was also evaluated.Of 3660 patients, 1610 (44%) had eGFR ≥90, 1608 (44%) 60-˂90, 300 (8%) 45-˂60 and 142 (4%) 15-<45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

41606413,2026-01-29,Use of a Cystatin C-Based GFR Equation in a Population Pharmacokinetic Model of Methotrexate Clearance in Adult Patients with Lymphoma.,"High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is a key treatment for lymphoma with central nervous system involvement. Whether incorporating cystatin C into glomerular filtration rate estimation improves methotrexate (MTX) clearance prediction remains unclear.We aimed to evaluate whether cystatin C-inclusive glomerular filtration rate equations improve MTX clearance prediction and to explore the relationship between MTX exposure and acute kidney injury (AKI) in adult patients with lymphoma receiving HDMTX.This was a prospective single-center study performed on 80 adult patients with lymphoma receiving HDMTX (1.5-8 g/m2) over a 4-h infusion. A population pharmacokinetic model was constructed using data from 80 administrations of HDMTX and 427 serum MTX concentrations. The population pharmacokinetic model estimated MTX concentrations were included in a logistic regression to assess the relationship between MTX exposure and AKI.A two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetic data, with baseline albumin and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C (eGFRCr-CysC) as significant covariates on clearance. Seventeen patients (21%) developed any-stage AKI. Among those receiving ≤ 3.5 g/m2, model-estimated 4-h MTX concentrations were associated with AKI (odds ratio: 1.02 per µmol/L; p = 0.0038), with an optimal threshold of 160 µmol/L (area under the concentration-time curve: 0.818). Patients above this threshold were 22 times more likely to experience AKI (p = 0.0005). This association was not observed in patients treated with 8 g/m2. Despite a lower dose and exposure, patients receiving ≤ 3.5 g/m2 demonstrated a stronger concentration-toxicity relationship.Our results support the use of cystatin C-inclusive glomerular filtration rate estimates in MTX pharmacokinetic modeling and suggest early MTX concentration sampling may identify AKI risk, enabling proactive, AKI-mitigating clinical interventions during HDMTX therapy.© 2026.

At least one peak anti-Xa was required, obtained 3 to 5 hours after the 3rd consecutive dose. The primary outcome was the range of dosing that produced goal prophylactic peak anti-Xa following linear regression modeling. Secondary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit (ICU)/progressive care unit (PCU) length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and VTE/bleed events within 72 hours after an eligible peak anti-Xa.A total of 311 encounters and 388 peak anti-Xa levels were assessed. Patients were 46 (37-55) years old, 53.1% were male, and weighed 183.3 kg (166.1-204.1) with a BMI of 61.3 kg/m2 (54.8-69.4). Creatinine clearance was 179.6 mL/min (126.5-228.2) and patients received 4 doses (4-6) before peak anti-Xa, with a time between of 249 minutes (227-271). Linear regression modeling revealed a statistically significant correlation (r2 = 0.27) between weight-based dose and peak anti-Xa (p < 0.0001). Enoxaparin 0.34 mg/kg (95% CI 0.33-0.36) twice daily was predicted to achieve a peak anti-Xa of 0.3 IU/mL.

In this study, the researchers tested a technique called temporary occipital nerve stimulation as a possible transitional therapy for a patient with chronic intractable cluster headache. This involves placing a small electrical device near the occipital nerve at the back of the head to stimulate it and potentially provide relief from the headache pain. The researchers monitored the patient's symptoms and headache frequency over several weeks to see if this approach was effective.

The results showed that temporary occipital nerve stimulation was able to significantly reduce the patient's headache frequency and severity, providing important proof-of-concept for this novel treatment approach. This suggests it",Neurology,
41604411,2026-01-29,Assessing the sustainable development of a national research ecosystem: A generative AI-based evaluation of empirical educational research in China (2004-2023).,"A nation's progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) depends in part on the long-term health of its educational research system, yet systematic, longitudinal assessments of such research ecosystems remain scarce. This study applies a generative artificial intelligence-based framework to evaluate the sustainable development of China's empirical educational research ecosystem from 2004 to 2023. We compiled a dataset of 2,145 empirical studies published in leading Chinese education journals and used GPT-4o to score each paper on 31 quality indicators covering research problem, theoretical framing, design, data collection, analysis, and reporting, using a 1-10 analytic rating scale. Based on the resulting score distributions, we constructed a fuzzy relation matrix and applied a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to derive annual and overall sustainability indices, while the Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method was used to determine objective indicator weights. The overall sustainability index of China's empirical educational research ecosystem over the 20-year period is 75.77 on a 100-point scale, with membership degrees concentrated at quality levels 7 (0.328) and 8 (0.435), indicating a generally robust and maturing system. Longitudinal trends reveal three stages of evolution-fluctuating development, rapid growth, and continuous improvement-corresponding to a shift toward more stable high-quality output. At the micro level, the ecosystem shows strong responsiveness to real-world educational problems, with high average scores for the relevance (8.45) and social significance (8.23) of research questions, as well as generally solid research design and data analysis practices. However, relatively lower scores for transparency of data analysis (7.08) and accessibility of raw data (6.46) highlight persistent challenges for reproducibility, open science, and methodological innovation. We conclude that China's empirical educational research ecosystem has reached a relatively high and stable level of performance but faces critical tasks in strengthening data openness, methodological renewal, and AI-augmented governance.

41609618,2026-01-30,Novel Association of NAV3 with Dilated Cardiomyopathy and its Role in Cardiac Fibrosis.,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as a potential genetic determinant of myocardial recovery in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This study aimed to understand its functional role in cardiac pathophysiology by leveraging omics approaches. Single-cell RNA-seq transcriptomic data from previously published adult human hearts indicates that NAV3 expression is highest in cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting its functional role in these cells. In vitro, stimulation of primary human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts with TGF-β1, induced NAV3 expression in a dose and time-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated knockdown of NAV3 significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced fibroblast activation, reducing the expression of α-SMA, collagens, and fibronectin. RNA sequencing of NAV3-silenced fibroblasts confirmed by Western blot revealed upregulation of cell cycle regulators and downregulation of profibrotic markers, suggesting that NAV3 facilitates TGF-β1-induced cell cycle arrest and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. Notably, NAV3 silencing did not alter canonical SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, implying a role for NAV3 in modulating non-canonical fibrotic signaling through other pathways. Our findings provide functional and mechanistic insights into NAV3's novel role in cardiac fibrosis, showing that reduced NAV3 expression attenuates TGF-β1-mediated fibroblast activation by regulating cell cycle signaling. These results support further investigation of NAV3 as a potential modulator of cardiac fibrosis and myocardial recovery in DCM.",American journal of physiology.

However, any consequences of discontinuing atorvastatin remain unknown. We hypothesized that symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) recurs more frequently in cerebral cavernous malformations after discontinuation of atorvastatin than placebo.We conducted a 12-month posttreatment follow-up of patients enrolled in the Atorvastatin Therapy in Cavernous Angiomas with Symptomatic Hemorrhage Exploratory Proof of Concept (AT CASH EPOC) trial (41 randomized to atorvastatin, 39 to placebo) to identify potential recurrent SH after trial drug discontinuation. Every SH was adjudicated by review of imaging and corresponding symptoms. Patients were excluded from follow-up for <90% compliance with study drug, for its discontinuation <3 months after trial enrollment, for statin reinitiation <3 months after discontinuation, or for lack of follow-up. Cases were censored during follow-up upon cerebral cavernous malformation resection/radiation or later statin reinitiation.Follow-up included 33 patients who had been randomized to placebo and 32 who had taken atorvastatin. Four SH events occurred at 3, 49, 84, and 225 days after atorvastatin discontinuation, and 1 SH at 395 days after discontinuing placebo. There was significantly lower symptomatic hemorrhage-free survival in the atorvastatin-discontinuation group (log-rank χ2=4.136, P=0.042). The hazard ratio was 0.162 (95% CI, 0.027-0.977) for placebo versus atorvastatin discontinuation.Discontinuation of atorvastatin was associated with a higher risk of recurrent SH compared with placebo discontinuation. Additional studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis-generating observation, examine potential mechanisms, and how best to mitigate this risk.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02603328.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Jan 29, 2026",2026.0,Jan,29.0,Bader Ali|Robert Shenkar|Justine Lee|Roberto J Alcazar-Felix|Richard E Thompson|Agnieszka Stadnik|Georgio Sader|Sean P Polster|Kelly D Flemming|James K Liao|Matthew Sorrentino|Romuald Girard|Daniel F Hanley|Issam A Awad,Kelly D Flemming,"Section of Neurovascular Surgery, Department of Neurological Surgery University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences Chicago IL USA.|Department of Neurology, BIOS Clinical Trial Coordinating Center, Trial Innovation Center Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Baltimore MD USA.|Department of Neurology Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Department of Medicine University of Arizona Tucson AZ USA.|Section of Cardiology, Department of Medicine University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences Chicago IL USA.","Bader Ali, Robert Shenkar, Justine Lee, Roberto J Alcazar-Felix, Richard E Thompson, Agnieszka Stadnik, Georgio Sader, Sean P Polster, Kelly D Flemming, James K Liao, Matthew Sorrentino, Romuald Girard, Daniel F Hanley, Issam A Awad",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41608890/,"This research study looked at the effects of discontinuing a cholesterol-lowering medication called atorvastatin in patients with a condition called cerebral cavernous malformations.

Accurate prediction of onset would inform clinical management and trial enrollment. Prior studies indicate that individualized maps of brain atrophy can predict conversion to dementia in f-FTLD. We used a Bayesian linear mixed-effect (BLME) prediction method for identifying accelerated brain volume loss to predict conversion to dementia.Participants included 234 asymptomatic or prodromal carriers of C9orf72, GRN, or MAPT mutations (including 21 dementia converters) with ≥3 longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1-weighted scans. The BLME models established individual voxel-wise gray matter trajectories using the first 2 scans. Person-specific clusters of accelerated volume loss were estimated in subsequent scans and tested as predictors of dementia conversion compared with other approaches in time-varying Cox proportional hazard models covarying for age. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves estimated utility of cluster volume in discriminating which participants converted to dementia within 24 months.The BLME cluster volume predicted conversion to dementia in f-FTLD mutation carriers overall and separately in C9orf72, GRN, and MAPT, with comparable hazard ratios observed for atrophy W-maps and regional volumes. Within a 24-month timeframe, BLME cluster volume discriminated dementia converters from non-converters with larger areas under the curve (AUCs) than other approaches.Bayesian-modeled individualized atrophy scores predict dementia progression among asymptomatic f-FTLD mutation carriers and may have increased utility compared with other structural imaging methods when studying individuals over shorter timeframes that align with clinical trial design.

We aimed to characterize risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with DA in a large, international CeAD cohort. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the Antithrombotic Treatment for Stroke Prevention in Cervical Artery Dissection (STOP-CAD), an international, multicenter, retrospective cohort. Patients with spontaneous CeAD were assessed for DA at baseline and de novo DA formation. Significant covariables in univariable analysis were included in multivariable regression models aiming to identify factors associated with DA formation. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association of DA with ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Results: Among 4,008 patients with CeAD, 546 (13.6%) had a DA at baseline, and 221/2938 (7.5%) patients developed a de novo DA during follow up, of which 172/221 (78.2%) were detected in the first 180 days. Patient with DA had a mean age of 47 years and 383 (49.9%) were women. Baseline or de novo DA was associated with history of connective tissue disorder (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.02; 95% CI, 1.22-3.36), fibromuscular dysplasia (aOR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.28-2.25) and multiple vessel dissection (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.98). Lower odds of DA was seen in Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.97) and ischemic stroke presentation (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.34-0.49). Fibromuscular dysplasia was associated with de novo DA formation (aOR 2.30; 95% CI, 1.52-3.49).

Tumor burden in nonresectable melanoma has a major impact on immunotherapy efficacy, yet little is known on its impact in the Neo-ICI setting. We evaluated the association between tumor burden, measured by the sum of diameters (SoD), and pathological response in melanoma patients treated with Neo-ICI. A meta-analysis of published trials in resectable stage III/IV melanoma was conducted, extracting data on patient characteristics, treatment regimens, pathological response, and survival outcomes. A total of 451 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 47% (95% confidence interval: 35-58%; P < 0.001). Meta-regression demonstrated a significant association between SoD and pCR (moderator = -0.36; P = 0.032), with greater tumor burden associated with lower pCR rates. No significant association was observed between SoD and recurrence-free survival (RFS). This study identifies higher tumor burden as a potential risk factor for lower pathologic response rates to neoadjuvant therapy, underscoring the need to incorporate tumor burden into future clinical research and potentially clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers analyzed data from several previous clinical trials to understand how the size of the tumor affects the success of this treatment. They found that patients with larger tumors were less likely to have a complete response to the treatment, meaning the tumor was completely eliminated. However, tumor size did not seem to impact the long-term survival of patients. This suggests that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be more effective for patients with smaller melanoma tumors.

41606708,2026-01-30,Assessment of Adrenal Cortical Neoplasms for the GU Pathologist.,"The challenging aspect of adrenal gland pathology is that adrenal cortical carcinoma is rare but is in the differential for every adrenal gland biopsy and adrenalectomy specimen. Currently, the Weiss system (for adult patients) and Wieneke criteria (for pediatric patients) remain the most widely used for diagnostic adrenal cortical pathology. More recent multiparameter systems have been developed, including those using different parameters and schemes for specific scenarios. Even so, there are caveats with each multiparameter scoring system. Also, if Ki-67 is not performed as part of a multiparameter scoring system, it should be performed as it has clinical significance in all age groups. The ""eyeballing"" method of interpretation of Ki-67 is discouraged.

41534110,2026-01-30,Estimating effective dose using non-lead protective aprons and a single dosimeter method.,"Fluoroscopic interventional procedures subject healthcare personnel to significant ionizing radiation exposure, necessitating the use of protective aprons. Protective aprons are made of varying materials and may be subjected to inadequate testing standards, leading to potential inaccuracies estimating effective dose when using single dosimeter methods. This study aims to develop an appropriate method to estimate effective dose for non-lead aprons using a single dosimeter worn outside the apron, thereby enhancing radiation protection and reducing musculoskeletal injuries to workers. A retrospective, secondary analysis of existing literature was conducted to derive a dataset suitable for algorithm development. Transmission of radiation through the protective apron at various thicknesses was modeled using exponential regression. The resulting equation incorporates the nominal lead equivalent thickness to estimate effective dose. Validation was performed by comparing algorithms using two-dosimeters, which do not rely on apron shielding assumptions. The dataset comprised 205 dosimeter readings from 42 physicians across 8243 procedures (Fetterlyet al). The derived equation,E=H0(0.13+1.02e(-11.33x)), demonstrated minimal underestimation, and a potential overestimation of up to 1.3-fold relative to the true effective dose, improving upon previous methods by 15%. Inclusion of a non-lead thyroid collar reduced effective dose by 17%-30%. Use of accessory upper body shielding is required when using this method. This novel method provides a method to estimate the effective dose using non-lead aprons at varying nominal lead equivalent thicknesses, surpassing previous single dosimeter approaches.

Resection with negative margins is the primary recommended therapeutic approach, while adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also play a role in their treatment in certain situations, including lesions with positive margins or those that are poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated. Cervical spine chordomas pose significant surgical challenges given their proximity to critical anatomical structures and the mechanical constraints of the cervical spine. In the current case series, authors aimed to explore the clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of the surgical treatment of cervical chordomas in a large multicenter cohort.This multicenter case series analysis utilized data from the prospectively collected Primary Tumor Research and Outcomes Network (PTRON) registry, from its inception (May 16, 2016) to data extraction (February 29, 2024). The study population was restricted to patients with histologically confirmed cervical chordomas involving levels C0-7, who underwent surgical treatment at one of the participating centers, and for whom both the initially planned and postoperatively pathologically confirmed surgical margins were documented. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical and adjuvant treatments, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), overall survival (OS), and perioperative adverse events were retrieved. PROs included the Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire version 2.0 (SOSGOQ2.0), EQ-5D, and SF-36 version 2.0 (SF-36v2).Thirty-eight patients were identified, 12 of whom underwent true en bloc resection (EBR), 18 of whom underwent deliberate intralesional resection, and 8 of whom underwent EBR after intralesional surgery or in whom EBR failed. True EBR led to better LRFS (92% vs 83% vs 63%, respectively) and OS (83% vs 39% vs 50%, respectively). Surgical adverse events within 1 year were more frequent with true EBR (100% vs 39% vs 75%, respectively). EQ-5D, SOSGOQ2.0, and SF-36v2 showed improvement with true EBR, whereas the trends for PROs from the other groups were more variable.This multicenter case series analysis provides critical insights into the clinical outcomes and PROs in the largest cohort of surgically treated cervical spine chordomas described to date. It underscores the importance and challenges of wide resection for oncological control. It establishes the associated morbidity and provides an overview of PROs following surgery.

We evaluated the prognostic value of a tissue-free, epigenomic ctDNA assay in patients with stage III colon cancer (CC) enrolled in a phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trial.Plasma samples were collected after surgery and before adjuvant infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin alone or combined with cetuximab. ctDNA was analyzed using a tissue-free assay; in ctDNA-positive patients, tumor fraction (TF) was quantified and genotyping was performed with a 739-gene panel. Associations with disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using multivariable Cox models adjusted for covariates.Among 2,260 evaluable patients, 461 (20.4%) were ctDNA-positive with significantly higher detection in advanced T-/N-stage, high-grade, obstruction/perforation, and BRAFV600E tumors. At a median follow-up of 6.1 years, ctDNA positivity was independently associated with shorter TTR (hazard ratio [HR], 5.96 [95% CI, 5.11 to 6.96]), DFS (HR, 5.03 [95% CI, 4.36 to 5.81]), and OS (HR, 4.45 [95% CI, 3.76 to 5.27]; all P < .0001).

Data regarding the efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unclear. Finerenone, a non-steroidal MRA, has demonstrated reduction in hospitalizations in this population. However, the comparative efficacy of different MRA classes in these patients remains elusive.We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using the TriNetX research network. We applied 1:1 propensity score matching to compare patients with HFpEF initiated on finerenone versus spironolactone. We examined 1-year risks of heart failure exacerbation, acute kidney injury, electrolyte derangements, and cardiovascular outcomes.We identified 254,417 patients with HFpEF and MRA use. After propensity score matching, each cohort contained 491 patients. Analysis revealed that finerenone use was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart failure exacerbation (HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.74], p < 0.001), all-cause mortality (HR = 0.38 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.64], p < 0.001), and hypokalemia (HR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.85], p = 0.001). The aforementioned results, along with a reduction in AKI risk, were statistically significant after stratified subgroup analysis by DM and CKD.In this large real-world HFpEF cohort, finerenone use was associated with lower risks of heart failure exacerbation and all-cause mortality compared with spironolactone.

We hypothesized that computational flow simulation could identify adverse hemodynamic features associated with postfenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair branch occlusion.Patients undergoing 4-vessel fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair for Extent II to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Branches that occluded without identifiable kinking or stenosis on computed tomography were included, along with an equal cohort of anatomy-matched patent controls. Patient-specific pulsatile rigid-wall simulations were performed using SimVascular with individualized geometries and boundary conditions. Abnormal time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) was defined as <10 or >70 dynes/cm2.Nine patients (36 target vessels) experienced 10 branch occlusions. Postoperative pressure and flow did not differ significantly between occluded and patent renal or mesenteric branches. However, occluded renal and mesenteric branches demonstrated significantly larger postoperative areas of abnormal TAWSS compared with controls (renal: 14.5% versus 5.9%, P=0.003; mesenteric: 17.7% versus 9.9%, P=0.035). Logistic generalized estimating equation modeling showed abnormal TAWSS to be a significant predictor of renal branch occlusion (P=0.0085). Model estimates suggested occlusion probabilities of 1.1%, 31%, and 94% at 0%, 10%, and 20% abnormal TAWSS surface area, respectively. A cluster-bootstrapped receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve, 0.876) identified a >10.2% threshold that correctly classified 92% of renal occlusions. Abnormal TAWSS frequently localized to distal stent-artery interfaces.Elevated abnormal TAWSS within stented renal branches is associated with subsequent branch occlusion after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair.

Despite its routine use, the prognostic efficacy of 13N-ammonia PET MFR remains unconfirmed in larger multicenter cohorts of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease.We considered patients from 5 sites in the REFINE PET (Registry of Fast Myocardial Perfusion Imaging With Next Generation PET) registry who underwent 13N-ammonia PET myocardial perfusion imaging for coronary artery disease. Clinical and imaging data were collected at the time of myocardial perfusion imaging. MFR was quantified as the ratio of stress to rest myocardial blood flow, using QPET software (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models adjusted for clinical and imaging covariates.In total, 6277 patients were included (median age of 65 years, 56% male). Median follow-up time was 3.8 years. There were 1895 patients with MFR ≤2 and 4382 with MFR >2. Patients with MFR ≤2 had significantly higher mortality than those with MFR >2 (n=701 [37.0%] versus n=537 [12.3%], respectively; P<0.001). Annualized all-cause mortality rates by MFR and summed stress score ranged from 1.7 to 15.8. In multivariable analysis, MFR ≤2 was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in the overall population (hazard ratio, 2.70 [95% CI, 2.41-3.03]; P<0.001), even among patients with no perfusion defects (hazard ratio, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.93-2.89]; P<0.001). Mortality risk decreased across increasing MFR deciles, ranging from hazard ratio, 2.73 (95% CI, 2.39-3.11) to hazard ratio, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.25-0.50).In this large multicenter cohort, MFR derived from 13N-ammonia PET myocardial perfusion imaging is a strong, independent predictor of all-cause mortality, even in patients with normal perfusion.

While typically bilateral, a rare subset presents with strictly unilateral involvement. This variant remains underrecognized and is often misdiagnosed as glioma, demyelination, or chronic encephalitis due to overlapping clinical and imaging features. Unilateral PACNS (U-PACNS) may manifest as tumor-like solitary or multifocal lesions, infarcts, or hemorrhages. Imaging, including vessel wall imaging, perfusion, and spectroscopy may demonstrate underlying abnormalities but is often nonspecific. Histopathologically, most cases show small- to medium-vessel lymphocytic vasculitis, in contrast to granulomatous inflammation, which is more common in bilateral disease. Diagnosis is challenging, particularly in angiography-negative presentations, and often relies on excluding systemic, infectious, and neoplastic mimics. Recognition of U-PACNS is critical, as timely immunosuppressive therapy can avoid misdiagnosis, alter disease course, and prevent irreversible deficits. The authors found 49 reported cases of U-PACNS in the English language literature.

However, incidental renal radiation exposure presents a significant risk of radiation nephropathy, and this risk varies based on the unique characteristics of the radionuclide and its decay phenomenon as well as the peptide being utilized. This review explores the historical development of PRRT, the physics of radionuclide therapy as necessary for a practicing nephrologist, and key mechanisms of radiation-related kidney injury. We detail renal handling of radionuclides, dose thresholds and pathological features of PRRT-induced nephropathy. Furthermore, we discuss both current and prospective strategies to reduce renal toxicity-such as amino acid infusions, receptor saturation, cleavable linkers and emerging protective agents. Special considerations for PRRT in patients with chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis are highlighted.

41015071,2026-02-01,A Bayesian re-analysis of the STRESS trial.,"Prophylactic steroids are often used to reduce the systemic inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass in infants undergoing heart surgery. The STRESS trial found that the odds of a worse outcome did not differ between infants randomized to methylprednisolone (n = 599) versus placebo (n = 601) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.86; P = .14). However, secondary analyses showed possible benefits with methylprednisolone. To investigate further using a different probabilistic approach, we re-analyzed the STRESS trial using Bayesian analytics.We used a covariate-adjusted proportional odds model using the original STRESS trial primary endpoint, a ranked composite of death, transplant, major complication and post op length of stay. We performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to assess the probability of benefit (OR < 1) versus harm (OR > 1). Primary analysis assumed a neutral probability of benefit versus harm with weak prior belief strength (nearly noninformative prior distribution). To illustrate magnitude of effect, we calculated predicted risk of death, transplant or major complications for methylprednisolone and placebo. Sensitivity analyses evaluated pessimistic (5%-30% prior likelihood of benefit), neutral and optimistic (70%-95%) prior beliefs, and controlled strength of prior belief as weak (30% variance), moderate (15%) and strong (5%). A secondary analysis derived empirical priors using data from four previous steroid trials.The posterior probability of any benefit from methylprednisolone was 92% and probability of harm was 8%. Composite death or major complication occurred in 18.8% of subjects with an absolute risk difference of -2% (95% CI -3%, +1%) for methylprednisolone. Each of 9 sensitivity analyses demonstrated greater probability of benefit than harm in the methylprednisolone group with 8 of 9 demonstrating >80% probability of benefit and ≥1% absolute difference in risk of death, transplant or major complications. In secondary analysis deriving priors from previous steroid trials, results were consistent with a 95% posterior probability of benefit.Our Bayesian re-analysis of the STRESS trial, using a range of prior beliefs, demonstrated a high probability that perioperative methylprednisolone reduces the risk of death or major complications in infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass compared with placebo.

We sought to assess the prevalence of osteoporosis and symptomatic fragility fractures in patients with adrenal adenomas and hypercortisolism, and explore associations with the degree of cortisol excess and frailty.This multicenter cross -sectional study involved prospective enrollment of adults with nonfunctioning adrenal adenomas (NFA), MACS, Cushing syndrome (CS) and referent subjects without adrenal disorders during the study period (January 2019-September 2022). All participants completed a bone health questionnaire at enrollment and had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone mineral density assessment within 12-months. Final analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use.Participants included 117 with NFA (median age 62 years, 80% women), 191 with MACS (median age 63 years, 74% women), 62 with CS (median age 50 years, 92% women), and 101 referent subjects (median age 59 years, 47% women). Both patients with CS (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.1-8.3) and MACS (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9-4.9) had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis when compared to referents. Among patients with MACS, only those with post 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (post-1mg-DST) cortisol > 83 nmol/L had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis when compared to referents (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4-7.5) and NFA (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4). For clinical fragility fractures, only patients with CS showed an increased prevalence when compared to referents (OR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.7-26.4) and NFA (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.3-11.2). Prevalence of clinical fragility fractures was similar to referents in patients with MACS (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 0.6-6.9) and NFA (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.4-6.1), and was not associated with post-1mg-DST cortisol or frailty in the MACS and NFA groups.Patients with CS, and those with MACS and post-1mg-DST cortisol > 83 nmol/L, exhibited a higher burden of osteoporosis.

This research paper explores the importance of blood pressure variability in stroke patients. Fluctuations in blood pressure can have significant impacts on the brain and overall health, especially for those who have experienced a stroke. The researchers aimed to develop a framework for understanding these blood pressure changes, identify opportunities for medical interventions, and outline practical research goals for the future.

By reviewing existing scientific literature, the researchers found that excessive blood pressure variability is linked to poorer outcomes for stroke patients, including increased risk of additional strokes, brain damage, and death. However, the specific mechanisms behind these connections are not yet fully understood. The researchers propose that further study is needed to clarify the relationships between blood pressure patterns, brain function, and overall health in stroke survivors. This could lead to the development of new treatments or monitoring techniques to help stabilize blood pressure and improve long-term recovery.

41053277,2026-02-01,Translating cellular senescence research into clinical practice for metabolic disease.,"Translational research on cellular senescence has led to numerous early-phase clinical trials targeting senescent cells to treat, prevent or alleviate multiple disorders and diseases, including metabolic diseases and their comorbidities. Cellular senescence is a cell fate that occurs in response to stressors, including metabolic disruptions, and is one of the hallmarks (or pillars) of ageing. In their senescent state, cells cease proliferation and can develop a senescence-associated secretory and metabolic phenotype that contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and ageing. Metabolic stress, which is central to the development of metabolic diseases, can trigger cellular senescence, thereby enabling a vicious cycle that exacerbates metabolic dysfunction. Therapies targeting senescent cells (senotherapeutics), either alone or in combination with other gerotherapies or lifestyle interventions, hold great promise for addressing the ongoing obesity epidemic and the need for improved therapies to prevent and treat metabolic diseases and their complications and comorbidities. In this Review, we discuss novel senotherapeutics, including challenges related to the translation of these therapies and the need to establish gerodiagnostic biomarkers to track the elimination of senescent cells, define eligibility and measure efficacy, as well as considerations for clinical trial design and execution.© 2025.

Despite various assessment tools attempting to provide consistent surgical skill evaluations, current methods remain inherently subjective.This proof-of-concept pilot study aimed to assess if a 3-dimensional surgical navigation system could capture objective surgical data during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). A secondary aim was to analyze if there were any differences between novice and practiced trainees.Otolaryngology residents performed supervised ESS on patients while their instrument (microdebrider, suction) motion was recorded using a TruDi® Navigation System. Prior to the surgery, surgical landmarks were defined with sensory beacons in the navigation system using the patient's preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan. Metrics included time to reach beacons, number of alerts at each beacon, and instrument speed.Fifteen otolaryngology residents performed 87 ESS. The navigation system successfully obtained ""time to reach sinus X"" data for 64% of sinuses/ case, velocity data in 93% of cases, and number of beacon ""alerts"" per minute in 93% of cases. We found a significant difference between PGY 3 residents and PGY 4/PGY5 residents in the number of sphenoid sinus alerts per minute (P = .01) and the percentage of cases in which the resident accessed the maxillary sinus via the natural os (P < .001).This study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting objective, navigation-based intraoperative metrics during live surgery and is a first step toward building a comprehensive objective assessment tool in ESS.

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), electric fields delivered via skin-based arrays that disrupt cancer cell division, have demonstrated efficacy and safety in glioblastoma, NSCLC, and pancreatic cancer.In the phase 3 METIS trial (NCT02831959), adults with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed NSCLC BMs suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) receiving optimal therapy for extracranial disease were randomized 1:1 to SRS followed by TTFields (150 kHz) or SRS alone. Radiologic progression was assessed by an independent radiology review committee. The primary endpoint was TTIP (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases criteria). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, neurocognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and safety.Patients (N = 298) were followed for a median of 8.6 (0.07-85.2) months. TTFields significantly delayed TTIP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.53-0.98]; Fine-Gray P = .044). Intracranial progression rates at months 2, 6, 12, and 24 were 13.6% versus 22.1% (P = .034), 33.7% versus 46.4% (P = .018), 46.9% versus 59.4% (P = .023), and 53.6% versus 65.2% (P = .031; post hoc). Time to distant intracranial progression favored TTFields therapy, although not statistically significantly (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.51-1.12]; log-rank P = .165; post hoc). In patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 118), the delays in both TTIP (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.39-1.0]; Cox P = .049; Fine-Gray P = .055) and time to distant intracranial progression (HR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.21-0.81]; log-rank P = .0087, post hoc) were more pronounced. Device-related adverse events were mainly grade ≤2 skin events. TTFields did not cause QoL deterioration, and improvements in deterioration-free survival and time to deterioration of the global health status, physical functioning and fatigue domains were observed (post hoc).By significantly prolonging TTIP, without worsening QoL or cognitive function, TTFields after SRS is a new treatment option for patients with NSCLC BMs, including those receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Patients with these brain tumors often have a poor prognosis, so finding better treatments is crucial. 

The researchers conducted a clinical trial to test a therapy called Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), which uses electric fields delivered through pads on the scalp to disrupt cancer cell division and growth. They compared patients who received TTFields after undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (a type of targeted radiation therapy) to those who only had the radiosurgery. The key finding was that TTFields significantly delayed the time it took for the brain tumors to start growing again, without causing additional side effects or worsening quality of life. This benefit was even more pronounced in patients also receiving immunotherapy drugs.

41005511,2026-02-01,"An international, expert-based, multispecialty Delphi consensus document on stroke risk stratification and the optimal management of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis.","The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS) and symptomatic carotid stenosis (SxCS) is controversial and includes intensive medical management (ie, best medical therapy [BMT]) with or without an additional carotid revascularization procedure (ie, carotid endarterectomy [CEA], transfemoral carotid artery stenting [TFCAS] or transcarotid artery revascularization [TCAR]). The aim of this international, expert-based, multispecialty Delphi consensus document was to reconcile the conflicting views regarding the optimal management of AsxCS and SxCS patients.A three-round Delphi consensus process was performed including 63 experts from Europe (n = 37) and the United States (n = 26). A total of six different clinical scenarios were identified involving patients with either AsxCS or SxCS. For each scenario, five treatment options were available: (i) BMT alone, (ii) BMT plus CEA, (iii) BMT plus TFCAS, (iv) BMT plus TCAR, and (v) BMT plus CEA/TFCAS/TCAR. Differences in treatment preferences between US and European participants were assessed using Fisher's exact test, and odds ratios were used to quantify the magnitude and direction of association. Consensus was achieved when >70% of the Delphi consensus participants agreed on a therapeutic approach.Most participants concurred that BMT alone is not adequate for the management of a 70-year-old fit male or female patient with 80% to 99% AsxCS (52/63 [82.5%] and 45/63 [71.5%], respectively). In contrast, most panelists would opt for BMT alone for an 80-year-old male AsxCS patient with several comorbidities (48/63 [76.2%]). The majority of participants would opt for BMT plus a carotid revascularization procedure for an 80-year-old male SxCS patient with a recent ipsilateral cerebrovascular event, an ipsilateral 70% to 99% SxCS, and a 5-year predicted risk of ipsilateral ischemic event of 10% (54/63 [85.7%]), 15% (59/63 [93.6%]), or 20% (63/63 [100%]). The opinion of US-based participants varied from that of Europe-based respondents in some scenarios.The panel agreed that BMT alone is insufficient for most patients with SxCS, and that select subgroups of AsxCS patients may also benefit from revascularization, especially when high-risk features are present. Patients should be stratified according to their predicted stroke risk, as well as their individual clinical, anatomical, and imaging features and should be treated accordingly.Copyright © 2025 Society for Vascular Surgery.

41081560,2026-02-01,Participant Retention in a Prospective Multicenter Cohort of Participants With Pancreatitis and Factors Associated With Attrition.,"Participant retention is essential in prospective studies to minimize bias and maintain validity. This study aimed to estimate retention rates and identify factors influencing attrition in a multicenter cohort (PROCEED) of US adults with acute/recurrent acute pancreatitis (AP/RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP).Participants from the PROCEED study with AP/RAP or CP eligible for follow-up within the designated visit window were included. Retention was defined as completing at least one follow-up visit during the observation period. Retention was analyzed by follow-up mode (in-person and/or medical record review) and disease type (AP/RAP and CP). Retention factors were assessed using univariate analyses (Wilcoxon rank-sum for continuous variables, χ 2 /Fisher's exact for categorical) and multivariable logistic regression. Missing data were adjusted using multiple imputations in statistical modeling.Among 1279 participants (AP/RAP: n=632, median age 47, 48.9% female; CP: n=647, median age 54, 46.5% female), we observed high cumulative and annualized retention rates, with improved retention when incorporating medical record reviews. In multivariable regression analyses, older age was statistically significantly associated with in-person retention in the AP/RAP group ( P =0.0001), while a higher self-reported physical health (assessed with PROMIS Global Health Physical Health T-score) was a key predictor of retention in CP ( P =0.034).Integrating medical records review substantially enhanced retention rates, enabling robust analyses of pancreatitis outcomes and disease progression. Older age and better self-reported physical health were key predictors of retention, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to enhance engagement among younger participants and those with poorer health in long-term studies.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

An aging population, contemporary prosthetic designs, and broadened indications are factors associated with this predicted increase. Although TEA can reliably improve pain and function, overall complication rates remain relatively high compared with other arthroplasties, making technical competence of utmost importance. Careful patient selection, preoperative optimization, and thorough counselling on the complication profile and the potential for mechanical failure following TEA are essential. Although debated, surgical exposure to perform TEA should be tailored to the underlying diagnosis and elbow features. Contemporary exposures, including the paraolecranon and the ""diamond pop-up,"" have been popularized only recently. Understanding the nuances of adequate implant positioning, soft-tissue balancing, and good cementation technique can decrease implant interface stresses, impingement, and rotational instability, which have a direct effect on subsequent mechanical failure.

40990237,2026-02-01,Changes in the Regional Incidence of Lyme Disease Across the United States From 2004 to 2019: A PHIS Database Study.,"Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in United States children. It was traditionally thought to be limited to the Northeast and upper Midwest due to the prevalence of tick and deer vectors in these regions. We hypothesize that as Lyme disease cases in children continue to increase throughout the country, nontraditional regions such as the Midwest and South may have an increased rate of Lyme disease compared with the Northeast region.The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database was queried for patients 19.0 years or younger who were treated for Lyme disease between 2004 and 2019 through Emergency Department and in-patient records using ICD coding. Data from 49 pediatric hospitals was included and the centers were split into 4 regions based on geographic location. The data was separated into 2 time periods: 2004 to 2014 and 2015 to 2019. Slopes were compared using a general linear model with interaction to determine if annual rates of Lyme disease were statistically different between the 2 time periods. The data was then split by geographic region and again the annual rate of Lyme disease was compared between the 4 regions. A P -value <0.008 was considered significant to adjust for multiple comparisons.Between 2004 and 2019, 7,572 cases of Lyme disease were reported with a mean age of 9.5 years (range: 0.08 to 19.00 y) and 58% male. From 2004 to 2019, there was an annual increase of 46.5 cases. When separated by region from 2004 to 2019, the Midwest had a higher increased annual rate of Lyme disease (30.7 additional cases/year) compared with the Northeast (10.0 additional cases/y), the South (3.6 additional cases/y), and the West (2.2 additional cases/y).Lyme disease continues to show an increased rate across the United States. The annual increase in cases in the Midwest was significantly higher than the other regions from 2004 to 2019. There does appear to be a significant regional spread, particularly in the Midwest. Awareness of the increased rate and spread of Lyme disease across the US is crucial in helping to identify national and regional strategies to diagnose and treat this disease in children.Level IV.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The authors analyzed medical records of melanoma patients to compare the survival rates of those with melanotic versus amelanotic tumors. They found that patients with amelanotic melanoma had significantly poorer disease-specific survival compared to those with melanotic melanoma. This suggests that the lack of pigmentation in amelanotic melanoma may be an indicator of more aggressive cancer biology and worse prognosis for patients.

We evaluated longitudinal cognition in LLD against nondepressed (ND) older adults with equivalent AD risk and pathology and assessed relative contributions of clinical and neuroimaging characteristics to cognitive change.Longitudinal.Outpatient psychiatry program.Participants (120 LLD, 240 ND) were matched on demographics, global cognition, mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, and Amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity.Participants underwent genetic testing, 3T MRI, and Aβ PET at baseline, and serial neuropsychological assessment extending up to 36 months postbaseline.After accounting for demographics, MCI diagnosis, and AD risk and pathology, LLD showed accelerated decline on tests of global cognition, verbal memory, and attention/processing speed. Lower baseline cortico-limbic volume was associated with greater decline in global cognition, verbal memory, and attention/processing speed regardless of LLD diagnosis. Baseline Aβ positivity predicted greater decline on tests of global cognition and verbal learning and memory regardless of LLD diagnosis.

We describe the findings of an artificial intelligence-guided laser capture microdissection (LCM) pipeline for harvesting neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) by maturation level into pretangles (pre-NFTs), mature tangles (iNFTs), and ghost tangles (eNFTs) using 38 cases obtained from 2 independent biobanks. We evaluated the performance characteristics of proprietary machine learning algorithms for the subclassification of these NFT categories in anti-pTau217-stained whole slide images of entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, frontal, and parietal cortex sections. Overall precision/recall/F1 scores were highest for Classifier A (0.6/0.46/0.5). The best performing algorithm was used to guide LCM capture and inform NFT enrichment. Targeted proteomics on tau signature peptides (pTau181, pTau217, and TauMTBR) was performed on approximately 1250 NFT collections. The results demonstrated that their abundance increased from pretangles to mature tangles (∼2-11-fold increase), and that this was followed by a sharp reduction in ghost tangles (∼3-116-fold decrease), with pTau217 showing the most drastic change.

40940258,2026-02-01,The fate of the TMJ metal fossa implant: a long-term follow-up.,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) metal fossa (hemijoint) prosthesis was a treatment modality for select TMJ disorders starting in the 1960s, but was taken off the market in 2015. While many were placed, and some medium-term follow-up has been reported, there is a paucity of long-term follow-up on this prosthesis to guide current clinical decision-making. A cross-sectional survey of 200 Mayo Clinic patients documented to have had a hemijoint implant placed between 2000 and 2015 was performed. The primary outcome measure was the length of time the hemijoint prosthesis was retained. Secondary outcomes were quality-of-life measures (reasons for removal, patient satisfaction, range of motion or dietary restrictions, pain, occlusion, and related secondary interventions performed). At the time of survey collection, 148 (74%) of the surveyed patients still had a hemijoint in place, of whom 119 (80.4%) reported satisfaction with the prosthesis and their current level of function. Pain was the most frequent reason for hemijoint removal (30/52, 57.7%). The mean lifespan of the removed hemijoints was 7.5 years. This study suggests that many hemijoint recipients have retained their prosthesis in the long term with acceptable outcomes and it may not be necessary to remove these prostheses simply due to their presence.Copyright © 2025 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Data from two stages of pharmacotherapy in the 'Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care for Depression' (EMBARC) study from participants with both brain and blood biomarkers were included (N = 197). Participants were initially randomized to sertraline or placebo (Stage 1), and depending on clinical response at week-8, their therapy in Stage 2 was either maintained or switched (to sertraline, if a non-responder to placebo, or to bupropion, if a non-responder to sertraline). Three readily accessible clinical features combined with 15 multi-modal features associated with baseline depression severity predicted stage 2 remission with an AUC of 0.74, 0.71, and 0.73 for sertraline, bupropion, and placebo treatment respectively. Propensity score-matching (causal inference) was conducted across Stage 2 treatment arms, and the same features were used to build an unsupervised model to produce the probability of remission to the given Stage 2 treatment (as factual outcome), as well as the alternative treatment not given (as counter factual). While the accuracy of observed outcomes across treatment arms was 82%, the accuracies of predicted counterfactual (unobserved) outcomes warrant future prospective studies. 16 weeks and associated biomarker-based prediction of counterfactuals suggest that the selected markers are highly sensitive features for guiding antidepressant treatment selection.© 2025.

The primary outcome was detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) (International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group [ISUP GG] ≥2) of TBx + PLBx vs TBx + SBx. Results were stratified by PI-RADS score and biopsy history. The PLBx cores were defined as samples taken from prostate sectors adjacent to the mpMRI lesion. We finally assessed insignificant PCa (insPCa, i.e., ISUP GG 1) detection across biopsy strategies. Differences were assessed using the chi-square test.Detection of csPCa was 48%. Overall, TBx + SBx had a higher csPCa detection rate than TBx + PLBx (50% vs 45%, P = 0.03), particularly in PI-RADS 3 lesions (26% vs 21%, P = 0.02) and active surveillance (AS) patients (46% vs 40%, P = 0.04).

We aimed to perform a comprehensive Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of pharmacological interventions on the incidence of postoperative delirium.Databases were searched from inception to September 2024. Our search was updated in January 2025. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials reporting the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients having cardiac surgery treated with pharmacological interventions. Bayesian models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and mean differences with 95%CrI through Markov chain Monte Carlo. Interventions were ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Sensitivity analyses and grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation assessment were conducted to evaluate the robustness and certainty of evidence.Seventy-nine randomised controlled trials comprising 24,827 patients were included, with 29 pharmacological interventions compared. Dexmedetomidine combined with melatonin was the most effective intervention, reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with placebo (risk ratio 0.31, 95%CrI 0.13-0.69; low certainty). Dexmedetomidine with melatonin also significantly decreased intensive care unit stay (2.4 days, 95%CrI -3.50-1.10) and hospital stay (1.32 days, 95%CrI -2.09 to -0.57). Other interventions, including ketamine and risperidone, showed potential efficacy but with low or very low certainty of evidence.We identified dexmedetomidine with melatonin as the most effective pharmacological strategy for preventing postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery. Whilst these findings highlight potential benefits, the low certainty of evidence underscores the need for more high-quality primary evidence.© 2025 The Author(s).

Participants with diabetes, body mass index >35 kg/m 2 , coronary artery calcium score >50 Agatston Units, and other cardiometabolic disease risk indicators were excluded from enrollment. In the ancillary KEEPS-Cog study, cognitive tests were completed at baseline, 18-, 36-, and 48-month post-randomization. In these analyses, cognitive variables were summarized as four cognitive domain-specific factor scores: verbal learning and memory, auditory attention and working memory, visual attention and executive function, and speeded language and mental flexibility. Waist-hip-ratio (WHR), an indicator of central adiposity, was measured at screening (baseline) and modeled as a covariate in linear latent growth models assessing associations of MHT with cognitive functions at baseline and over time.Higher baseline WHR was associated with poorer performance on all domain-specific cognitive outcomes at baseline and with changes in visual attention and executive function across time. Models including interaction effects were not significant for either o-CEE x WHR or t-E2 x WHR.Central adiposity is a risk factor for domain-specific cognitive decline, and thus, cognitive health effects should be investigated in early postmenopausal women, even in women with low cardiovascular risk statuses.","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","Feb 01, 2026",2026.0,Feb,1.0,Taryn T James|N M Dowling|Carola Ferrer Simó|Hector Salazar|Carol A Van Hulle|Gilda Ennis|Adrienne L Johnson|Mary F Wyman|Lauren WY McLester-Davis|Diane C Gooding|Barbara Fischer|Shenikqua Bouges|Emre Umucu|Firat Kara|Juliana M Kling|JoAnn E Manson|Eliot A Brinton|Marcelle I Cedars|Rogerio A Lobo|Genevieve Neal-Perry|Nanette F Santoro|Frederick Naftolin|Sherman M Harman|Lubna Pal|Virginia M Miller|Kejal Kantarci|Carey E Gleason,Firat Kara|Juliana M Kling,"University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.|George Washington University, Washington, DC.|University of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing, Pittsburgh, PA.|Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, W.S.

Demographic and clinical variables were compared between individuals with unhealthy and healthy diet quality. Regression models were constructed to explore associations between UDQ and demographic variables, bipolar subtype, chronotype, medical comorbidities, psychotropics and differences in social determinants of health-related stressors.Individuals with BD and UDQ (78.8 %) were significantly younger, more likely to be male, and to have a diagnosis of BD-I or schizoaffective bipolar subtype. Additionally, UDQ was significantly associated with evening chronotype, binge eating disorder, comorbid anxiety disorders, obesity, hypertension, and unemployment-related stress. A multivariable logistic regression model identified that a higher education level and older age at BD diagnosis were associated with lower odds of UDQ, while an evening chronotype and comorbid anxiety disorders increased the likelihood of UDQ.The study design limits causality assessment and poses recall bias from self-reported dietary tools.These findings highlight the importance of investigating diet quality as a potential therapeutic target in the management of BD to improve mood outcomes and mitigate risk of metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

41199442,2026-02-01,Loss of Enhancement in Vestibular Schwannomas Post Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Impact on Tumor Control and Serviceable Hearing.,"Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) often show transient loss of central tumor enhancement. We hypothesized that this loss of enhancement may correlate with better tumor control on follow-up imaging.We evaluated 198 consecutive patients from a single center who met eligibility criteria. Tumor volumes on the pre-SRS and post-SRS scans were quantified along with regions of loss of enhancement on the first post-SRS study. The latter was correlated with tumor volumes at follow-up, radiation isocenter density, and loss of serviceable hearing.For the entire cohort, the median loss of enhancement on the first post-SRS scan was 14% (IQR: 6 to 25) and median rate of change in tumor volume was -4.5% per year (IQR: -10.5 to 1.5). Percent loss of central enhancement showed significant negative correlation with tumor growth not only for the entire cohort (correlation coefficient: -0.18, P =0.01), but also for the subset of patients who had available imaging until at least 2 years (n=185) and 4 years (n=179) post-SRS. Loss of enhancement also strongly correlated positively with tumor volumes and number of radiation isocenters and negatively with isocenter density. Finally, patients with greater percent loss of enhancement had an increased likelihood of progression to non-serviceable hearing, although this association was not statistically significant.These findings suggest that loss of central tumor enhancement in VSs post-SRS may be associated with improved tumor control.Copyright © 2025, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",Otol Neurotol,"Feb 01, 2026",2026.0,Feb,1.0,Prav Mehta|Neetu Soni|John C Benson|Ramin Morshed|Christine M Lohse|Amit Agarwal|Milan Sonka|Michael J Link|John P Marinelli|Eric E Babajanian|Ghazal Daher|Jim R Dornhoffer|Karl R Khandalavala|Matthew L Carlson|Paul J Farnsworth|John I Lane|Girish Bathla,Prav Mehta|Neetu Soni|John C Benson|Ramin Morshed|Christine M Lohse|Amit Agarwal|Michael J Link|John P Marinelli|Eric E Babajanian|Ghazal Daher|Jim R Dornhoffer|Karl R Khandalavala|Matthew L Carlson|Paul J Farnsworth|John I Lane|Girish Bathla,"Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.|Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Department of Neurosurgery, UCSF, San Francisco, CA.|Departments of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|College of Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Prav Mehta, Neetu Soni, John C Benson, Ramin Morshed, Christine M Lohse, Amit Agarwal, Milan Sonka, Michael J Link, John P Marinelli, Eric E Babajanian, Ghazal Daher, Jim R Dornhoffer, Karl R Khandalavala, Matthew L Carlson, Paul J Farnsworth, John I Lane, Girish Bathla",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41199442/,"This research study examined the effects of a common radiation therapy treatment for vestibular schwannomas, a type of benign brain tumor. Vestibular schwannomas can cause hearing loss and other neurological problems, so effective treatment is important. The researchers looked at how these tumors responded to a specific radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). 

They found that many patients showed a temporary loss of tumor enhancement, meaning the tumors appeared less bright on medical scans after treatment. Interestingly, this loss of enhancement was associated with better control of the tumor growth over time. Patients with more loss of enhancement also tended to have smaller tumor volumes and more targeted radiation delivery. While the link to hearing preservation was not statistically significant, the findings suggest that this temporary change in tumor appearance after SRS may be a positive indicator for successful treatment.

41195873,2026-02-01,Evolution of the Indications and Outcomes of Total Pancreatectomy.,"The first total pancreatectomy (TP) resulting in survival past the immediate postoperative period was performed at Mayo Clinic in 1944. Although still uncommonly performed, indications have recently fluctuated. We aimed to evaluate trends in TP use and outcomes over four decades.Patients who underwent single-stage TP at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1988 to 2024 were analyzed in two cohorts: early era (EE, 1988 to 2009) and modern era (ME, 2010 to 2024).In total, 437 patients were identified: 118 during EE (mean 8 per year) and 319 during ME (mean 21 per year). Primary indications were adenocarcinoma (42% EE vs 60% ME), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (31% EE vs 17% ME), and chronic pancreatitis (11% EE vs 13% ME; p < 0.001). Concurrent vascular resection was performed in 9.3% (EE; all venous only) vs 53% (ME; venous alone in 20% and arterial with or without venous in 33%; p < 0.001). Multivisceral resection was performed in <1% (EE) vs 24% (ME; p < 0.001). Major complications occurred in 13% (EE) vs 27% (ME; p = 0.018), and 90-day mortality was 3.4% (EE) vs 6.3% (ME; p = 0.35). For adenocarcinoma, 5-year median overall survival from both surgery and diagnosis was significantly improved in ME (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001, respectively). Median last HbA1c was 7.7 (EE) vs 7.3 (ME; p < 0.001). Among patients surviving more than 1 year, insulin pumps were used in 12% (EE) vs 49% (ME; p < 0.001).The use of TP has dramatically increased in recent years, primarily for adenocarcinoma alongside increased use of neoadjuvant therapy and ever-expanding criteria for anatomic resectability. Operative complexity has significantly increased with resultant increased perioperative morbidity. TP remains a higher-risk procedure, specifically with en bloc vascular resections, emphasizing the importance of appropriate patient selection, preoperative patient education, and thoughtful postoperative and long-term management.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The researchers analyzed data on over 400 total pancreatectomies performed at a major medical center over four decades. They found that the use of this surgery has dramatically increased in recent years, particularly for treating pancreatic cancer. Surgeons are now more willing to perform additional procedures like removing blood vessels or other organs along with the pancreas to try to fully remove the disease. This has led to more complex operations with higher rates of complications, though mortality rates have remained relatively stable.

41192728,2026-02-01,Neural signatures of bipolar disorder subtypes: A comprehensive systematic review of neuroimaging studies.,"The neurobiological mechanisms differentiating bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) from type II (BD-II) remain poorly understood. A comprehensive synthesis systematically comparing neuroimaging findings between BD subtypes is lacking. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, Scopus, up to March 2024), including structural MRI, functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the common and distinct candidate neural signatures that differentiate BD subtypes. Out of the initial 5334 references, 38 MRI studies (41 experiments) were included. Structural MRI studies showed mixed results regarding volumetric and cortical surface differences between BD subtypes. BD-I exhibited widespread gray matter (GM) volume reductions, larger lateral ventricles, and decreases in cortical thickness. Hippocampal and cerebellar volume reductions were observed in both BD subtypes but did not differentiate BD-I from BD-II. While white matter (WM) abnormalities across BD subtypes remain heterogeneous and lack consistent replication, BD-I showed a tendency toward more disrupted WM microstructure and higher WM hyperintensities rates than BD-II. Functional MRI studies revealed distinct differences in task-based and resting-state activity, suggesting differential neural patterns in reward processing and emotion regulation. BD-I displayed a greater disconnection in emotion regulation circuits. While both BD-I and BD-II share some neuroimaging characteristics, the findings suggest BD-I is characterized by more pronounced WM disruptions and emotion dysregulation. In contrast, BD-II shows more remarkable subcortical volume preservation but with distinct connectivity alterations. These results offer insights into the different and shared neurobiological mechanisms of BD subtypes, which may help refine their pathophysiology and inform tailored interventions.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41183745,2026-02-01,The rabbit superior mesenteric artery as an in vivo model for perforator artery occlusion assessment after flow diversion.,"Covering side branches with flow diverters (FDs) raises concerns regarding side branch occlusion and potentially delayed ischemic complications. Existing preclinical models fail to replicate these risks. We developed a novel preclinical model using the rabbit superior mesenteric artery (SMA) to investigate FD-associated branch occlusion and neointimal changes.Eighteen rabbits were enrolled; three were excluded for periprocedural complications. Fifteen animals completed follow-up, each with a single FD implanted in the SMA (one of three Pipeline Embolization Devices: 5 Bare-Flex, 4 Shield-Flex, and 6 Vantage). Branch patency (using Digital subtraction angiography DSA and histology) and ostial coverage/neointima (using optical coherence tomography OCT), were assessed at 1 or 3 months. Results were compared between-(FD and time) groups using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test.Fifteen animals completed the study. Among 35 covered branches, 30 (85.7%) remained patent, 4 (11.4%) were pre-occlusive, and 1 (2.9%) occluded. Median ostium coverage by OCT was 77.0%. Mean in-stent stenosis was 35.0%. No significant difference were found across FD types or timepoints comparing patency, medium ostium coverage, in-stent stenosis. Histology confirmed progressive neointimal maturation and partial to full ostium coverage, with strong correlation to OCT findings. No correlation was found between neointimal thickness and ostium coverage.The rabbit SMA model successfully detected rare occlusions and common pre-occlusive changes, approaching clinical data.

41173227,2026-02-01,Concurrent Chiari malformation type I and hydrocephalus: Integrating mechanistic and pathophysiological insights toward a unified management paradigm.,"Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) and hydrocephalus often occur together, but their connection can involve a variety of different and overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. These include posterior fossa hypoplasia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow obstruction at the foramen magnum, venous outflow restriction, craniospinal pressure dissociation, and genetically mediated brain overgrowth. Such mechanisms often converge in complex developmental disorders, most notably syndromic craniosynostoses where premature suture fusion restricts posterior fossa expansion and perturbs venous and CSF dynamics, driving hindbrain herniation and ventriculomegaly. Concurrent CM-I and hydrocephalus may be best categorized into one of three mechanistic patterns: 1) hydrocephalus with secondary Chiari-like tonsillar descent (acquired CM-I); 2) CM-I with secondary hydrocephalus; or 3) simultaneous/complex presentations driven by shared developmental anomalies. Recognizing these distinctions is crucial for guiding treatment selection, as clinical management often relies on identifying the primary pathological driver, with CSF diversion (ventriculoperitoneal shunt [VPS] or endoscopic third ventriculostomy [ETV]) used for hydrocephalus-driven cases, posterior fossa decompression (PFD) for CM-I-driven cases, and multidisciplinary staged interventions reserved for complex or syndromic cases. Future directions include genetic stratification, advanced CSF dynamics imaging, computational biomechanical modeling, and the integration of multimodal data to individualize intervention timing and techniques.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and trajectory of MASLD-related LT in Spain and compare these findings with broader national data and international data sets.Multicenter retrospective cohort study including adults (18 y and older) undergoing LT for MASLD between 2010 and 2023 in 5 large Spanish centers. Additional data were obtained from the Spanish Transplant Registry (Organización Nacional de Trasplantes) and high-prevalence LT centers in the United States (n = 7) and Canada (n = 1).Among 3448 LTs performed in the 5 Spanish centers, 3.4% (n = 117) were MASLD-related. An increasing trajectory of MASLD-related LT was observed, with predictions suggesting a rise to 5.4%-10.8% of LTs for MASLD by 2028. These trends were consistent with Organización Nacional de Trasplantes data. Compared with North American data, the growth trajectory in Spain showed a less steep increase. Hepatocellular carcinoma rates were higher in the Spanish MASLD-LT recipients, yet metabolic comorbidities were frequent in all populations.The burden of MASLD-related LT in Spain is growing, yet at a less pronounced rate than in the United States/Canada.

We developed the Multifunctional Apparatus for Voltammetry, Electrophysiology, and Neuromodulation (MAVEN), a compact, battery-powered platform, to overcome these limitations and enable concurrent electrophysiological recordings, phasic and tonic neurochemical sensing, and programmable neurostimulation delivery. Herein, we present the preclinical validation of MAVEN in small- and large-animal models using addictive substances to elicit robust changes in dopamine and serotonin dynamics while also delivering programmable neurostimulation. Across models, MAVEN minimized stimulation artifacts and provided stable multimodal readouts, establishing feasibility and safety for real-time monitoring. Designed for both basic and clinical neuroscience, MAVEN enables investigations into DBS mechanisms, the neurochemical basis of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the potential role of neurotransmitters as actionable biomarkers for closed-loop neuromodulation. This has immediate relevance in the era of personalized neuromodulation and overcomes prior technical limitations that precluded direct investigation of human disease.Copyright © 2025.

We aim to investigate the pretransplant seroprevalence, MMR infection posttransplant, and whether immediate pretransplant MMR vaccination is associated with MMR infection.We queried the TriNetX database in December 2024 to assess (1) pretransplant MMR seroprevalence, (2) characteristics and outcomes of posttransplant MMR infections, and (3) outcomes for recipients who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant. Only US data were included. MMR infection was identified through International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.Among 313 548 SOT recipients identified in the database (from 2009 to 2024), IgG positivity for MMR was 72%, 80%, and 78% when available (~5% each). Based on ICD codes, posttransplant MMR infections occurred in 107 (0.03%), 124 (0.04%), and 38 (0.01%) recipients, respectively. The 90-d rejection rates were 36%, 27%, and 42%, whereas mortality rates were 7%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, in patients with MMR infection. Among 114 recipients vaccinated within 30 d pretransplant, none developed posttransplant MMR infections.Overall, posttransplant MMR infections in adult SOT recipients were uncommon in this data set, and no vaccine-associated infections were documented among those who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant in real-world practice. The primary limitation of this study is that most MMR infections were identified using ICD codes without confirmation through serological testing or polymerase chain reaction, and we were unable to further characterize the infections because the de-identified database lacked information on the patient's ZIP code and transplant hospital.

Histologic diagnosis of GI GVHD remains challenging due to overlapping features with other conditions and variability in guideline adoption.To assess current diagnostic practices, histologic thresholds, and guideline utilization among practicing pathologists evaluating GI GVHD.A 30-question, anonymous, web-based survey was distributed to GI pathologists worldwide. The survey explored diagnostic strategies, threshold criteria for apoptosis, use of grading systems, ancillary testing practices, and satisfaction with existing guidelines.Of the 200 pathologists contacted, 80 responded (40 % response rate), with 69 actively evaluating GI GVHD. Most respondents (92.8 %) practiced in academic settings, and 81.2 % had completed GI pathology fellowships. A majority (73.9 %) reported no standardized diagnostic criteria within their practice groups. Among those using guidelines, the NIH criteria were most commonly applied. There was substantial variability in the threshold for apoptosis, ranging from the presence of any apoptotic body to higher thresholds. Only 42 % of respondents routinely graded GI GVHD, primarily using the Lerner system.

Like-patient controls to those who qualified for TS were identified utilizing propensity-score matching from January, 2019 to May, 2021. Primary outcomes between all groups include wound healing rates and amputation-free survival.Of 138 patients enrolled in the LPP, 40 (30.0%) required some form of TS. Patients who required services were more likely to be non-Hispanic black, have public insurance, and live in an area with a higher area deprivation index compared to independent patients. Despite this, wound characteristics were similar between groups, including wound location and WIfI scores. Rates of wound healing (57.5 vs. 63.3%), major amputation-free survival (95.9 vs. 89.8%), and new ulcer development (22.5 vs. 17.3%) were all similar between groups (all P > 0.05).

We sought to investigate mechanisms of PARPi radiosensitization at varying linear energy transfer (LET) levels after observing an extreme normal tissue response in an 18-year-old with high-grade glioma, without a germline alteration predictive of heightened radiosensitivity, treated with veliparib and proton therapy.BRCA1/2 wild-type noncancerous and cancerous cells were treated with PARPi plus photons or protons at the entrance (dose-averaged LET 2.2 keV/µm) or the Bragg peak (BP, dose-averaged LET 7.0 keV/µm) of the proton beam profile. DNA fiber, immunofluorescence, and other DNA damage signaling assays were used to evaluate replication fork progression, gap formation, transcription-replication conflicts, and DNA damage signaling and repair.PARPi modestly sensitized cells to photons and low LET protons; however, PARPi-treated cells were hypersensitive to high LET protons administered at the BP. Unexpectedly, cells treated with PARPi plus BP protons displayed accelerated replication fork progression, enhanced single-stranded DNA gap formation, and greater transcription-replication conflict-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Despite evidence of more single-stranded DNA and cells arrested in G2/M following PARPi plus proton BP, PARPi decreased RAD51 recruitment to break sites and enhanced cytotoxic error-prone repair by nonhomologous end joining.PARPi renders cells hypersensitive to end-of-range high LET proton irradiation. The potential enhanced proton radiosensitization should be considered during clinical trial design with efforts to limit high physical dose and high LET overlap within normal tissues. Planning techniques that increase the LET within tumors warrant further investigation in combination with PARPi as a novel strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

What is unknown is the incidence of new pacemaker implantations (incident cardiac pacing), and its effect on cardiac function and clinical outcomes. The current study aims to address these knowledge gaps.Retrospective cohort study of adults with cc-TGA (2003-2024). Clinical indices (peak oxygen consumption, NYHA class, NT-proBNP, systemic and non-systemic ventricular strain) were assessed pre- and post-pacemaker implantation.Of 170 patients (age 41 ± 15 years, 49 % males), 39 (23 %) underwent pacemaker implantation (dual-chamber [N = 28,72 %], biventricular [N = 11,28 %]), yielding a 10-year incidence of 23 %. Risk factors associated with pacemaker implantation were initiation/uptitration of antiarrhythmic drug and cardiac surgery. Dual-chamber pacing was associated with worsening neuro-hormonal activation (higher NT-proBNP) and biventricular systolic dysfunction. In contrast, biventricular pacing was associated with improved systemic ventricular systolic function, functional capacity, and aerobic capacity, as well as less neuro-hormonal activation and congestion. Twenty-five percent [7/28] of patients with dual-chamber pacemakers were upgraded to biventricular pacemakers because of worsening heart failure.Incident pacemaker implantations remains high, especially among patients requiring antiarrhythmic drugs. Compared to dual-chamber pacing, biventricular pacing improved ventricular function and clinical indices across multiple domains.

40094355,2026-02-01,International Liver Transplantation Society practice guideline update on portopulmonary hypertension.,"Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH), pulmonary arterial hypertension that develops in the setting of portal hypertension, has long been of significant interest to the pulmonary, cardiology, and hepatology communities. Optimal management of POPH has been challenging to define due to a lack of evidence from clinical trials regarding pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies and uncertainty regarding the role of liver transplantation (LT). Initially, the high risk of intraoperative and early post-transplant death in predominantly untreated patients with POPH tempered consideration of LT. More recently, the observation that POPH can improve, and sometimes even resolve, following LT, has led to reconsideration of the role of LT in selected patients. The first International Liver Transplantation Society (ILTS) POPH and hepatopulmonary syndrome practice guideline was a multidisciplinary consensus of expert opinions based on available evidence. Since that publication, hemodynamic definitions, management approaches, and POPH MELD exception criteria have evolved, and there have been new randomized controlled trials in POPH as well as studies regarding long-term outcomes. In order to ensure the guidelines remained current and reflected recent evidence, the original writing committee of the 2016 guidelines, leaders of the ILTS Cardiovascular Special Interest Group, and colleagues active in POPH research were invited to participate in the writing committee. In this document, approved for publication by the ILTS executive council, we provide an update to the prior guidelines with expert recommendations to guide and advance POPH management. Recommendations in these guidelines are based on expert opinion and available evidence and were agreed upon by consensus.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The primary aim was to evaluate the incidence of IBD flare in the year before and after GAHT initiation.A retrospective study across 5 IBD centers. Flare was defined as need for steroids, IBD-associated emergency department visit, or need for IBD medication change. Factors associated with IBD flare were assessed with univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression controlling for age and IBD type.A total of 85 transgender and gender diverse adults with IBD who initiated GAHT were included in this study. Forty-six (54.1%) received estrogen and 39 (45.9%) received testosterone. In the year before GAHT, 42 (49%) flared compared with 32 (38%) in the year after, P = 0.06. There was no statistically significant difference in incidence of flare by age, IBD type, or IBD therapy type.

The prognostic value of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in these patients remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between irAEs and clinical outcomes in patients with HCC treated with ICIs.We searched the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for articles published from inception to June 2024, using keywords including ICI, HCC, and irAEs. Statistical analysis was performed with a random effects model.Of 3,028 studies, 24 (4,127 patients) met the criteria for inclusion.

The researchers reviewed 24 previous studies involving over 4,000 patients to see if these immune-related side effects were linked to better or worse outcomes. 

They found that patients who experienced immune-related side effects had higher response rates to the immunotherapy, meaning their tumors shrank more. These patients also had longer progression-free survival, meaning their cancer took longer to start growing again. There was also a trend towards longer overall survival, though the results were not statistically significant. Interestingly, the survival benefit was most pronounced in patients with mild side effects, rather than severe ones.

Passive exoskeletons are a potential intervention to support surgeons' body parts and alleviate strain and discomfort.The NekSpine (a passive neck exoskeleton) was trialed on 12 surgeons (7 males and 5 females) across 6 specialties. Each surgeon performed 4 surgical procedures, 2 with the NekSpine (exoskeleton) and 2 without (baseline). Exoskeleton and baseline surgeries were paired primarily by surgical procedure and secondarily by duration. Surgeons completed surveys that included the NASA-TLX and usability questions before and after surgical procedures to evaluate body part discomfort, overall fatigue, workload, and potential disruptions to the surgical workflow. Surgeons also wore inertial measurement units to objectively record their upper arms, neck, and torso postures.Use of the exoskeleton yielded significant decreases in discomfort in the neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, and left arm. Reductions in percent surgical duration in risk 4 (extreme risk postures) coupled with increases spent in risk 2 (moderate risk postures) for the neck and torso were noted.

No existing vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) algorithm targets ≥F2.The mAchine Learning ADvanceD fibrosis and rIsk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis Novel predictor (ALADDIN) study addressed this gap by introducing a machine-learning-based web calculator that estimates the likelihood of significant fibrosis using routine laboratory parameters with and without VCTE. Our study included a training set of 827 patients, a testing set of 504 patients with biopsy-confirmed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease from 6 centers, and an external validation set of 1,299 patients from 9 centers. Five algorithms were compared using area under the curve (AUC) in the test set: ElasticNet, random forest, gradient boosting machines, XGBoost, and neural networks. The top 3 (random forest, gradient boosting machines, and XGBoost) formed an ensemble model.In the external validation set, the ALADDIN-F2-VCTE model, using routine laboratory parameters with VCTE (AUC 0.791, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.764-0.819), outperformed VCTE alone (0.745, 95% CI 0.717-0.772, P < 0.0001), FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (0.710, 0.679-0.748, P < 0.0001), and Agile-3 model (0.740, 0.710-0.770, P < 0.0001) regarding the AUC, decision curve analysis, and calibration. The ALADDIN-F2-Lab model, using routine laboratory parameters without VCTE, achieved an AUC of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.668-0.749) and outperformed Fibrosis-4, steatosis-associated fibrosis estimator, and LiverRisk scores.Along with the steatosis-associated fibrosis estimator model developed to target significant fibrosis or higher, ALADDIN-F2-VCTE ( https://aihepatology.shinyapps.io/ALADDIN1 ) uniquely supports a refined noninvasive approach to patient selection for resmetirom without the need for liver biopsy.

40105977,2026-02-01,Population perspectives on benefits and harms of screening for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Screening for diseases can have psychological impacts, such as anxiety, and requires acceptability from the population to be effective. This study examined the perspectives on the benefits and harms of screening for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) among the general population to optimize screening practices.A survey was sent to participants enrolled between 2020 and 2024 in a prospective MASLD screening study in Olmsted County, MN. The survey assessed participants' perceived anxiety, stigma, quality of life, preferred screening methods, financial concerns, and lifestyle impacts following screening and diagnosis. Of the 461 participants, 342 (74%) completed the survey. Overall, 14% of participants reported screening-related anxiety, and 14% were concerned about disclosing a potential MASLD diagnosis to others. Among those without a MASLD diagnosis, 99% felt reassured about their liver health, 48% reported an improved quality of life, and 25% made lifestyle changes pertaining to their diet, alcohol use, and physical activity. Of the 77 participants diagnosed with MASLD, 52% experienced some anxiety about their new diagnosis; however, 95% and 97% considered it important to receive an early MASLD diagnosis to mitigate the risk for cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease, respectively. Notably, 79% of diagnosed participants found the diagnosis beneficial in adopting healthier habits, with 30% achieving a >10% weight loss after screening.This population-based survey demonstrates that the perceived benefits of proactive MASLD screening, such as increased awareness, lifestyle changes, and early diagnosis, outweigh the harms.

Few studies have used mixed methods to learn what happens at the patient and health care staff level to explain these delays. Methods: This single-institution, multi-site study interrogated the entire medical record system (thousands of patients annually) for homelessness and cancer diagnoses from January 1, 2019, through October 10, 2023. Records were abstracted for relevant quantitative and qualitative data; rigorous methods were used to analyze, integrate, and report findings. Results: Forty-three patients with a median age of 58 years (range: 32, 73 years) and 34 (79%) assigned male sex at birth are the focus of this report. The most common cancers include hematologic (n = 8), gastrointestinal (n = 8), and genitourinary (n = 8). Thirty-five patients (81%) initiated cancer therapy, and 27 (63%) manifested treatment delay (>4 weeks post-diagnosis). The median time to cancer therapy was 9 weeks (95% confidence interval: 4.6, 12 weeks). Qualitative themes that explain delays are as follows: (1) logistical challenges in communication between the patient and health care team (""lack of a cell phone""); (2) patient reluctance to receive care (""patient elected to leave Against Medical Advice""); and (3) medical challenges in providing care (""he was hospitalized after being found down and hypotensive"").

Synthetic data-artificially generated patient records designed to mirror real-world distributions-offers a potential solution. We hypothesized that diffusion models, a state-of-the-art generative technique, could produce synthetic liver transplant waitlist data from the United Network for Organ Sharing database that maintains statistical fidelity, replicates clinical correlations and survival patterns, and ensures robust privacy protection.Diffusion models were used to generate synthetic patient cohorts mirroring the United Network for Organ Sharing liver transplant waitlist database between the years 2019 and 2023. Statistical fidelity was assessed using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and Wasserstein distance, correlation analysis, and variable-level metrics. Clinical utility was evaluated by comparing transplant-free survival via Kaplan-Meier curves and the MELD score performance. Privacy was quantified using the Distance to Closest Record (DCR) and attribute disclosure risk assessments.The synthetic dataset was nearly indistinguishable from the original dataset (MMD=0.002, standardized Wasserstein distance <1.0), preserving clinically relevant correlations and survival patterns as evidenced by similar median survival times (110 vs. 101 days) and 5-year survival rates (22.2% vs. 22.8%). MELD-based 90-day mortality prediction was maintained (original AUC=0.839 vs. synthetic AUC=0.844). Privacy metrics indicated no identifiable patient matches, and mean DCR values ensured that synthetic individuals were not direct replicas of real patients.Artificial intelligence-generated synthetic data derived from diffusion models can faithfully replicate complex hepatology datasets, maintain key clinical signals, and ensure strong privacy safeguards.

Despite this, treatment protocols are heterogeneous, and frequently based on historical practices, or low-quality evidence.To update evidence-based guidelines for the use of imaging in the clinical management of patients with VS published by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons in 2018.Systematic review of the literature published from 1/1/2015 to 5/20/2022 regarding imaging protocols for VS management. Salient questions were identified by a writing group of diverse individuals with topic-specific expertise. Questions were validated by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons Guidelines Committee. Following systematic review, literature tables and summary statements pertinent to the study questions were generated by the writing group, which underwent subsequent evaluation and revision by the task force before formalization.Seven questions were formulated; adequate literature was identified to formulate updated recommendations for 6 of these. Search strategy identified 1143 unique records, of which 109 underwent full-text review, and 57 were included in this study. Most studies provided level III evidence, with rare level II studies noted, yielding level III recommendations.The current evidence base for imaging protocols in VS clinical management is broad, diverse, low certainty, and low quality. This in part reflects a heterogeneous disease, although variability in treatment philosophies may also influence local decision making. Key areas for future study include the clinical utility of advanced imaging techniques and head-to-head comparisons of imaging protocols for patients in common initial VS management pathways (eg, observation, resection, or stereotactic radiosurgery).

AI's effectiveness correlates not only with the algorithm's quality but also with its training data's integrity. This systematic review investigates the racial disparities perpetuated by AI systems across diverse medical domains and the implications of deploying them, particularly in healthcare.Six electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane) were systematically searched on October 3, 2023. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles in English from 2013 to 2023 that examined instances of racial bias perpetuated by AI in healthcare. Studies conducted outside of healthcare settings or that addressed biases other than racial, as well as letters, opinions were excluded. The risk of bias was identified using CASP criteria for reviews and the Modified Newcastle Scale for observational studies.Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 1272 articles were initially identified, from which 26 met eligibility criteria. Four articles were identified via snowballing, resulting in 30 articles in the analysis. Studies indicate a significant association between AI utilization and the exacerbation of racial disparities, especially in minority populations, including Blacks and Hispanics. Biased data, algorithm design, unfair deployment of algorithms, and historic/systemic inequities were identified as the causes. Study limitations stem from heterogeneity impeding broad comparisons and the preclusion of meta-analysis.To address racial disparities in healthcare outcomes, enhanced ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks are needed in AI healthcare applications.

39588898,2026-02-01,Exploring the Utility of Carpal Tunnel Biopsy in Amyloidosis: A Current Perspective.,"Recent literature has emphasized the role of hand surgeons in screening patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) for amyloidosis by performing a carpal tunnel synovial biopsy during open carpal tunnel release (CTR). This has led to misconceptions about the diagnostic utility of synovial biopsy and the clinical evaluation of suspected amyloidosis. Controversy over carpal tunnel biopsy is exacerbated by minimally invasive advances in CTR procedures. This current perspective aims to determine the role of carpal tunnel synovial biopsy in amyloidosis and provide an update for hand surgeons regarding the nuances of amyloidosis. We conclude that carpal tunnel synovial biopsy should not be performed without CTS symptoms but only in patients meeting criteria for open CTR such as in those with severe symptoms which have failed nonoperative treatment and minimally invasive procedures are contraindicated. A screening approach for amyloidosis is proposed in patients presenting with CTS symptoms. Despite advances in the understanding, treatment, and diagnosis of amyloidosis, there remains a need for accurate, specific, and sensitive diagnostic tests.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)","Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Mikaela H Sullivan|Maria A Rodriguez Brilla|Christopher J Klein|Alexander Y Shin,Mikaela H Sullivan|Christopher J Klein|Alexander Y Shin,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Univeridad de los Andes, School of Medicine, Bogata, Colombia.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Mikaela H Sullivan, Maria A Rodriguez Brilla, Christopher J Klein, Alexander Y Shin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39588898/,"This research paper explores the role of a specific medical procedure, called a carpal tunnel biopsy, in diagnosing a rare condition called amyloidosis.

The first-stage operation consisted of hepato-renal bypass using modified ex vivo renal reconstruction with single end-to-end anastomosis to both RAs using a saphenous vein graft. A second stage FB-EVAR was performed using patient-specific manufactured stent-graft with 3 fenestrations for the CA, SMA, and LRA 6 weeks later. The patient recovered with no complications. At 4 years, the patient had widely patent hepato-renal bypass and target vessels with normal renal function.The use of adjunctive hybrid procedures may optimize or facilitate FB-EVAR. In this patient, salvage of 2 small RAs was not ideally suited for branch stenting but was possible using modified ex vivo RA reconstruction with preservation of kidney parenchyma and function.Clinical ImpactThis case report illustrates a hybrid approach to overcome one of the most frequent limitations to total endovascular incorporation of renal arteries, eg small diameter, early bifurcation and multiple vessels. The modified ex vivo technique allows meticulous renal artery reconstruction without the deleterious effect of warm ischemia and without the cumbersome reconstruction of ureter and vein that is needed with traditional on table ex vivo auto transplantation.

38967354,2026-02-01,Transplantation Within 6 Months of Registration Does not Enhance Survival for Patients With Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma.,"Determine whether the timing of transplantation affects patient mortality.Neoadjuvant therapy and liver transplantation have emerged as an excellent treatment option for select patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA). However, the optimal timing of transplantation is not known.We reviewed all patients registered for a standardized pCCA protocol between 1996 and 2020 at our center. After adjusting for confounders, we examined the association of waiting time with patient mortality in an intention-to-treat cohort (n=392) and those who received a liver transplant (n=256).The median (interquartile range) time from registration to transplant or dropout was 5.74 (3.25-7.06) months. Compared with a short wait time (0-3 mo), longer waiting times did not affect all-cause mortality: (3-6 mo) hazard ratio (HR) 0.98; 95% CI: 0.52-1.84; (6-9 mo) HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.39-1.65; (9-12 mo) HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.26-1.22. Subgroups with a shorter waiting time had similar survival to those with long waiting times: living donor available HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.67-1.42; AB or B blood group HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.62-1.39. Longer waiting times were associated with decreased all-cause mortality after transplantation (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97). This benefit began after a 6-month waiting time minimum (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.26-1.10) and increased further after 9 months (HR: 0.43 95% CI: 0.20-0.93). Waiting time was not associated with residual adenocarcinoma in the explant (odds ratio 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00).A waiting time of at least 6 months will optimize results with transplantation without affecting overall (intention-to-treat) patient survival.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether outcomes differed between first pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b and multiple pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2c-3.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included original studies in which outcomes were stratified based on first pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b and multiple pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2c-3. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of modified Rankin Scale 0-2. Secondary outcomes of interest were rates of modified Rankin Scale 0-1, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality. We calculated odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.ResultsFour studies with 1554 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Rate of modified Rankin Scale 0-2 (odds ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.70-1.18; P-value = 0.49), modified Rankin Scale 0-1 (odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval = 0.86-1.71; P-value = 0.27), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 0.47-3.98; P-value = 0.57), and mortality (odds ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.67-1.25; P-value = 0.56) did not differ between first pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b and multiple pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2c-3. There was no heterogeneity among included studies for modified Rankin Scale 0-2, modified Rankin Scale 0-1, or mortality; however, there was moderate heterogeneity among studies for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (I2 = 53%, P-value = 0.12).ConclusionsClinical and safety outcomes did not differ between first pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b and multiple pass thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2c-3.

We evaluated the prognostic value of ""SBP reduction with stability,"" a novel end point combining controlled blood pressure reduction and maintenance, using data from two large multinational clinical trials.We analyzed patients with ICH from Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 and Intensive BP Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial 2 trials presenting with initial SBP 150-220 mm Hg. SBP reduction with stability was defined as achieving and maintaining SBP between 130 and 150 mm Hg within the first hour after randomization based on consecutive recordings. Outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin scale 0-2) at 90 days and neurological deterioration within 24 h, adjusted for potential confounders.Among 3,694 patients with ICH (2,781 patients from Intensive BP Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial 2 and 913 patients from Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2), 1,061 patients (28.7%) achieved SBP reduction with stability within 1 h. Patients had mean age 63.3 ± 12.9 years, baseline SBP 177.14 ± 18.28 mm Hg, and median hematoma volume of 10.78 mL (interquartile range 5.5-19.16). Achieving SBP reduction with stability significantly improved functional independence odds (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.64) and reduced neurological deterioration odds (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.88) after adjusting for initial SBP, Glasgow Coma Scale, age, sex, stroke history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, study, ICH location, hematoma volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage presence.Only 30% of patients with mild-to-moderate ICH achieved SBP reduction with stability within the first hour. This achievement was associated with improved functional outcomes and reduced early neurological deterioration. These findings suggest that SBP reduction with stability represents a valuable therapeutic target for future clinical trials in ICH management.© 2025.

Surgical intervention is the primary treatment, yet limited research exists on factors influencing disease severity. This study explores the impact of hormonal contraception on iSGS recurrence rates and surgery-free intervals.This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary academic care center. Patients using hormonal birth control (e.g., estrogen-progesterone pills, progesterone implants) during their first procedure were classified in ""Birth Control (BC)"" group, while those not using contraceptives were placed in ""No Birth Control (NBC)"" group. Poisson regression evaluated recurrence rates, and Mann-Whitney tests assessed surgery-free intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated time to first recurrence, adjusting for age and follow-up duration.Twenty-six patients were in the NBC group and 12 in the BC group (average ages 37 and 34, respectively). Patients in the NBC group were 2.6 times more likely to experience recurrence compared to those in the BC group (p = 0.001). The expected number of recurrences for the BC group was 0.4 times that of the NBC group (95% CI: 0.2-0.7; p = 0.001). Furthermore, patients taking birth control were significantly less likely to have a first recurrence (HR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.9; p = 0.025) and had longer times to first recurrence (Figure 1; p = 0.031).Birth control appears to protect against iSGS severity, potentially through hormonal mechanisms.

Admission variables, MELD 3.0, original MELD, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were used to create a decision rule to classify inpatient death using cutoffs to maximize negative predictive value and decision-tree models sorted each predictor's relative contribution. For external validation, data from 3 Mayo Clinic sites were used.A total of 7239 patients were included from 115 centers across 6 continents among whom 808 (11.2%) died in-hospital. Cutoffs maximizing negative predictive value for in-hospital transplant-free mortality were bilirubin ≤7.5 mg/dL, creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL, INR ≤1.5, MELD ≤27, and MELD 3.0 ≤28. On decision tree analysis, the relative contributions to mortality were HE (42.2%), infection (22.2%), INR (18.6%), bilirubin (12.7), and creatinine (4.3%). Using only liver-specific variables, patients with bilirubin ≤7.5, INR ≤1.5, and without HE had only 3.3% mortality, whereas patients with bilirubin >7.5, INR >1.5, and HE had 33% mortality. External validation in 1634 patients from Mayo transplant evaluation cohort showed similar patterns for inpatient mortality prediction.Cutoffs associated with mortality are admission bilirubin >7.5 mg/dL, INR >1.5, creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, MELD >27, and MELD 3.0 >28. Liver failure may therefore be identified by the serum bilirubin >7.5 mg/dL and INR >1.5, with HE and admission infections as contributors toward mortality.Published by Elsevier Inc.",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Jasmohan S Bajaj|Scott Silvey|Aidan Mullan|Ashok Choudhury|Florence Wong|Jacob George|Ramazan Idilman|Mark Topazian|Wai-Kay K Seto|Aldo Torre|Peter Hayes|Leroy R Thacker|Brian J Bush|Mario Alvares da Silva|Qing Xie|Patrick S Kamath,Aidan Mullan|Patrick S Kamath,"Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.

40839197,2026-02-01,Secukinumab in the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Pooled Pharmacokinetics and Safety Results From the SUNSHINE and SUNRISE Phase 3 Studies.,"Secukinumab, a fully human, monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-17A, is approved for moderate-to-severe HS in adults. This study evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) changes, and safety of secukinumab over 52 weeks in SUNSHINE and SUNRISE Phase 3 trials.An exploratory analysis of pooled Phase-3 trials evaluated serum PK and safety of secukinumab 300 mg every 2 (SECQ2W) or 4 weeks (SECQ4W). A population PK model assessed the effects of body weight, disease severity, and baseline hsCRP on secukinumab serum concentration. Exposure-response analysis assessed the relationship between predicted PK and HS clinical response [HiSCR]. No confirmatory statistical testing was performed.Mean serum trough concentration at Weeks 16, 24, and 52 was ~2-fold higher with SECQ2W vs. SECQ4W. At Week 16, exposure overlap was high, with an estimated numerical increase in HiSCR of ~3% for SECQ2W over SECQ4W. At Week 52, HiSCR levels plateaued. At Week 16, hsCRP decreased from 18.6 ± 26.3 mg/L to 12.8 ± 18.0 mg/L (SECQ2W), 15.9 ± 27.6 mg/L to 11.5 ± 18.4 mg/L (SECQ4W), and remained unchanged with placebo (14.4 ± 22.5 mg/L to 14.7 ± 23.8 mg/L); reductions were sustained through Week 52. Higher body weight, disease severity, and baseline hsCRP were associated with lower secukinumab serum concentrations. Secukinumab immunogenicity was low (< 1%), with no new safety signals.Secukinumab serum concentrations in patients with HS varied with body weight, disease severity, and baseline hsCRP. SECQ2W may benefit certain patients. Secukinumab reduced hsCRP through Week 52. The safety profile of secukinumab was consistent with other approved indications, with no apparent dose-response relationship observed.NCT03713619 (Novartis study code CAIN457M2301).

Surgical treatment is successful; yet, there is limited long-term data on dysphagia outcomes after surgery.Individuals prospectively enrolled in the Prospective Outcomes of Cricopharyngeal Hypertonicity (POuCH) collaborative with and without diverticula who underwent surgery from November 2014 to August 2024 and had at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Eating Assessment Tool 10 (EAT10) was used to characterize patient-reported outcomes. Descriptive statistics were performed using means, frequencies, and spaghetti plots.Of 164 patients initially identified, 2 withdrew and 2 were excluded for incomplete data; 160 were included. 31% were women, with a mean (SD) age of 70.1 (11.5). Endoscopic surgery (113, 71%) was more common than open technique (47, 29%). 19.4% of patients had undergone previous surgery. Postoperatively, patients were found to have improved EAT-10 scores, with smaller changes recorded after 36 months. Median change in EAT-10 compared to preoperative score was -12 points [IQR: -18, -5] at 12 months. 39 (24%) patients were followed for > 24 months (median change -11 [IQR: -14, -7]); 26 (16%) > 36 months (-9.5 [-17, -5]), and 12 (7.5%) > 48 months (-4 [IQR: -18, 4]). Six patients died during the study period.Improved dysphagia after surgery appears stable with minimal change over time. Most patients (96.3%) survive at least 1 year.

Outcomes included continuous measures (mean), proportions (%), and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals.Eighty-five studies (n = 764,403) examining anxiety, depression, and vestibular disorders in adults were included. Mean ages were 50.3 (vestibular) and 46.7 (control); females comprised 63.8% and 64.3%, respectively. Patients with vestibular disorders had significantly higher rates and risks of anxiety (31.4% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.0001; RR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0) and depression (28.3% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.0001; RR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.8-4.4) than controls. Elevated rates were observed in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (30.6%, 23.6%), Meniere's disease (47.0%, 43.1%), vestibular migraine (46.5%, 35.7%), and vestibular neuritis (19.4%, 20.7%) (all p < 0.0001).

Demographic, clinical, radiological, and surgical data were evaluated. Predictors of HOD and poor functional outcomes were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses.The cohort included 54 females (45.0%), with a mean age at diagnosis of 43.8 years (SD = 16.5). Symptomatic hemorrhage was present in 70.8% of patients at diagnosis, and 28.3% underwent surgical intervention. Radiographic HOD was observed in 20% of patients (n = 24), with 87% of cases involving lesions within the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT). Larger lesion size (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19, P = .027), pontine location (OR = 19.81, P = .006), and GMT involvement (OR = 25.24, P < .001) were significantly associated with HOD. Repeated symptomatic hemorrhage and surgery, including the extent of resection, did not predict the development of HOD. Patients with HOD had worse functional outcomes at last follow-up ( P = .012), with GMT involvement remaining the sole independent predictor of mRS ≥3 (OR = 3.44, P = .040).HOD reflects trans-synaptic degeneration within the GMT and is strongly associated with lesion location and size.

40669754,2026-02-01,Evaluating predictive performance and generalizability of traditional and artificial intelligence models in predicting surgical site infections postspinal surgery: a systematic review.,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a significant complication following spinal surgery. These infections contribute to increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and substantial healthcare costs. Traditional statistical models have been widely used to predict SSI risk, but artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning (ML) methods have also been used for SSI prediction.This systematic review aims to evaluate the predictive accuracy of AI models versus traditional statistical models in assessing SSI risk following spinal surgery.A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies were included if they developed predictive models for SSI following spinal surgery using either AI or traditional statistical approaches. Risk of Bias for all studies was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Predictive model performance was compared using metrics such as the C-statistic and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).A total of 51 studies were included. Among these, 42 studies used traditional statistical methods, while 9 used AI / ML models. Logistic regression was the most common method among traditional models (95.2%). Across the ML studies, all of which used supervised models trained on tabular data, decision‑tree-based and linear algorithms (n=7, 77.8% each) were the most common, followed by neural networks and support vector machines (n=4, 44.4% each). Traditional models achieved a C-statistic between 0.7 and 0.8 in 40.5% of cases (n=17), with only 4.8% (n=2) exceeding 0.9. AI models showed a C-statistic of 0.9 or higher in 44.4% of cases (n=4). However, 77.8% of those ML-based models (n=7) performed an internal cross validation and only 33.3% reported calibration data (n=3), and none of the studies are externally validated, which raises important concerns about their current clinical applicability and generalizability.This systematic review, the first of its kind, observed that studies utilizing the AI models reported a potential for excellent classification accuracy in predicting SSI following spinal surgery. However, the current shortcomings in methodology limit their generalizability and immediate clinical implementation. For existing models, most AI studies remain in the early stages of development and its findings in excellent performance should be taken with caution. This review highlights the need for standardized model benchmarking and employing external validation to reliably assess generalizability. Furthermore, advancing beyond conventional tabular data by incorporating state-of-the art AI models that leverage multimodal data could significantly expand the potential of predictive analytics in this domain - thus help guide clinical decision making.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40637438,2026-02-01,"Minimal Clinically Important Difference and Relative Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes After Surgery for Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: A Nationwide Study of 1,700 Patients.","Healthcare policies have seen significant reforms, with a marked transition toward a patient-centered approach. This shift emphasizes the use of subjective patient-reported outcome measures as key metrics. However, these measures often face limitations, particularly in identifying clinically meaningful changes over time. To address this challenge, the concept of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was introduced. This study aims to evaluate the predictive effectiveness of relative change and its associated threshold, the minimal clinically important relative change (MCIRC), as a potential alternative to absolute differences and the MCID.Data prospectively collected between 2006 and 2021 from the Swedish Spine Registry (Swespine) were analyzed. Patient-reported outcome measures included the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for neck and arm pain, the EQ5D index, EQ VAS, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Anchor-based methods were used to calculate the MCID and MCIRC. The predictive performance of absolute differences and relative changes was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.1756 patients were included. The selected MCID values were -3 for NRS neck pain intensity, -2 for arm pain intensity, 0.09 for the EQ5D index, 7 for EQ VAS, and -12 for NDI scores. For MCIRC, the chosen values were -47% for NRS neck pain intensity, -40% for arm pain intensity, 386% for the EQ5D index, 52% for EQ VAS, and -32% for NDI scores. On area under the ROC curve, relative change was superior for NRS neck and arm pain scores and NDI, while absolute difference was superior for EQ5D and EQ VAS scores.Relative change, along with its associated minimal clinically important value (MCIRC), proved to be a more suitable indicator of subjective satisfaction for NRS and NDI scores. By contrast, absolute differences and the MCID were better suited for evaluating the EQ5D index and EQ VAS scores.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

Several facial nerve (FN) monitoring strategies have been explored over the past few decades ranging from free-running electromyography, direct nerve stimulation, continuous nerve stimulation, facial motor evoked potentials, blink reflex, and others. Hearing preservation surgery is guided primarily by far-field auditory brainstem response and real-time cochlear nerve action potentials. Given the heterogeneity in tumor and patient factors, it remains very difficult to accurately predict cranial nerve outcomes, regardless of the monitoring strategy.To critically appraise literature regarding IONM during VS surgery and update the previous evidence-based clinical practice guideline.This is a systematic review of the literature, incorporating articles from March 2015 to May 2022. Literature published before 2015 that would have been included in the previous Congress of Neurological Surgeons guideline was not searched again in this update.FN monitoring provides better functional outcomes compared with anatomic dissection alone and may guide the extent of tumor resection. While facial motor evoked potentials and free-running electromyography can provide continuous noninvasive FN monitoring, there are insufficient data to determine which more strongly correlates with facial function outcomes. Both electrophysiological data and tumor size correlate with facial function outcomes. The ideal hearing monitoring strategy remains unclear as there are insufficient data comparing cochlear nerve action potentials with far-field auditory brainstem response. All studies were graded as Class III evidence.IONM should be used in all VS cases. While the optimal FN and hearing monitoring strategy remains elusive, available data support the use of a combination of strategies, including preoperative tumor size, to maximize sensitivity and specificity. There remains a significant need for high-quality comparative studies to determine which intraoperative monitoring scheme can provide intraoperative guidance and predict postoperative outcome.

Patients present with action myoclonus within days to months after awakening. There is no established first-line treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe treatments, diagnostic approaches, and long-term clinical outcomes for LAS.We performed a retrospective review of patients seen at three tertiary referral hospitals. An electronic database was used to identify all patients diagnosed with LAS from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2022. Demographics, diagnostics, treatments, and long-term clinical outcomes were extracted. Descriptive statistics were completed to summarize treatments, diagnostics, and clinical outcomes, which were assessed by Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at 6 months. Symptom control was defined as minimal or no residual myoclonus causing functional impairment on activities of daily living.Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. A total of 25 patients were diagnosed with LAS during the acute hospitalization after their cardiac arrest, and the rest were diagnosed in the outpatient setting. The most common initial treatment was levetiracetam (n = 26; 67%) followed by valproic acid (n = 4; 10.3%). Most patients initially treated with levetiracetam (n = 22; 85%) or valproic acid (n = 4; 100%) had symptom improvement. Most patients (n = 28; 72%) required a second medication. The most common second-line agent was a benzodiazepine (n = 13; 48%). Thirty-three patients (85%) had improvement of the myoclonus over time. Thirty (77%) were able to achieve symptom control. The median time to achieve symptom control for patients diagnosed in the inpatient setting was 70 days. At the 6-month follow-up, 8 patients (23%) achieved a CPC score of 1, whereas 11 patients (30%) had a CPC score of 2. Thirteen patients (33%) attempted to wean off their medications, of which six patients (46%) were successful.Most patients with LAS experienced improvement of their myoclonus while being treated with levetiracetam, valproic acid, or benzodiazepines, although multiple medications and long-term treatment were often used.

This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes at 6 months after implantation of traditional fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) versus those with antimigration fins (FCSEMS-AF) in patients with dMBO.Individuals undergoing FCSEMS or FCSEMS-AF placement for dMBO from May 2017 to September 2023 were identified. Outcomes included intervention-free stent patency, reintervention rates, time to endoscopic reintervention, clinical success, and adverse events (AEs). Analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.The cohort included 215 patients (142 with FCSEMSs and 73 with FCSEMSs-AF). Clinical success was similar in both groups (93.7% in FCSEMSs vs 95.9% in FCSEMSs-AF; P = .500). At 6 months, 84.8% of FCSEMSs had intervention-free patency compared to 77.1% of FCSEMSs-AF (P = .461), with similar rates of AEs (16.2% in FCSEMS and 21.7% in FCSEMS-AF groups; P = .335) and reintervention (16.2% of FCSEMSs and 22.1% of FCSEMSs-AF; P = .324). At 6 months, FCSEMSs-AF had higher rates of stent occlusion (13.2% of FCSEMSs vs 28.3% of FCSEMSs-AF; P = .011) and lower rates of migration (7.6% of FCSEMSs vs 0% of FCSEMSs-AF; P = .011). After adjusting for stent length, FCSEMSs had a higher risk of migration (hazard ratio 12.23 [95% CI, 1.9-78.66]; P = .008) with similar occlusion risk (hazard ratio 0.68 [95% CI, 0.31-1.51]; P = .342).FCSEMSs and FCSEMSs-AF have similar performance characteristics at 6 months; however FCSEMSs were more likely to migrate and had similar occlusion risk after stent length adjustment.

Patients from out-of-hospital encounters who exhibited workplace violence were compared with those being violent within the ED/hospital. Accounting for patient length of stay, rates of violence were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).A total of 206 out-of-hospital (0.78 per 100 encounters, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), 868 ED (1.06 per 100 encounters, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14), and 3,561 non-ED hospital (6.37 per 100 encounters, 95% CI 6.17- to 6.58) violent encounters were included in final analysis, representing 2,251 unique patients.

Prospective symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) (censored at first hemorrhage, surgery, or last follow-up) and functional outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Functional outcomes were measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at baseline, annually, and at the last follow-up.The cohort included 58.9% women and 41.1% men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 44.5 years. Zabramski Types I-IV (n = 113, 125, 40, and 7, respectively) differed significantly in clinical presentation ( P < .001). Type I lesions were symptomatic in 97.3%, Types II and III in 34.4% and 22.5%, respectively, while all Type IV lesions were asymptomatic. Type I lesions had the highest annual hemorrhage rate (13.9% per year) and a 5-year cumulative risk of 50.6%. Types II and III had lower rates (2.9% and 1.8%), whereas no hemorrhages occurred in Type IV lesions. At baseline, 70.8% of Type I patients had mRS ≥2, which decreased to 35.4% at the last follow-up. Type III lesions had favorable outcomes, with 7.5% of patients having mRS ≥2 at the last follow-up. Type IV lesions remained asymptomatic throughout. Severe SH significantly increased the odds of poor outcomes (mRS ≥3; P < .001), whereas Zabramski type was not predictive of outcomes after adjustment.Zabramski classification aids in stratifying hemorrhage risk and guiding management in CCMs. Severe SH is a critical determinant of functional outcomes, underscoring the need for comprehensive risk assessments and individualized patient care strategies.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

Those with MRI of the surgical hip obtained ≤1 year before surgery were included and categorized according to the presence of gluteal tendon tear, tendinopathy, or no pathology. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) at rest, VAS with use, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain, Forgotten Joint Score-12, and modified Harris Hip score.Twenty-three hips with gluteal tears (9 of 23 male, mean age 63.5 ± 29.3 years), 48 with tendinopathy (20 of 48 male, mean age 58.8 ± 10.4 years), and 8 with no pathology on MRI (6 of 8 male, mean age 42.4 ± 18.9 years) were followed for 4.9 ± 3.0 years (range 1.2 to 13.2 years) following THA. Among patients with gluteal tear or tendinopathy, preoperative MRI was done for suspected gluteal pathology in only 3 (13.0%) and 2 (4.2%) cases, respectively, with most cases noted incidentally. Nevertheless, all experienced notable improvement in pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes following surgery according to modified Harris Hip score score ( P ≤ 0.001 for all), and no differences were observed in VAS at rest, VAS with use, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain, or Forgotten Joint Score-12 between the groups ( P > 0.050 for all). Of note, no patient exhibited full-thickness preoperative gluteal tendon tearing with retraction on imaging.Gluteal tears or tendinopathy was detected in 89.9% of patients undergoing direct anterior THA for OA. Despite no intraoperative repair, postoperative improvements in pain and function were similar to those of patients with no gluteal pathology. These findings suggest that although gluteal pathology may be common among patients undergoing THA, patients with partial thickness gluteal tears or tendinopathy generally do well following surgery.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Feb 01, 2026",2026.0,Feb,1.0,Samuel S Rudisill|Sean C Clark|Jacob J Schaefer|Christopher V Nagelli|Luke S Spencer-Gardner|Cory G Couch|Naveen S Murthy|Michael J Taunton|Mario Hevesi,Samuel S Rudisill,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Rudisill, Clark, Schaefer, Nagelli, Couch, Taunton, and Hevesi), the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL (Spencer-Gardner), and Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Samuel S Rudisill, Sean C Clark, Jacob J Schaefer, Christopher V Nagelli, Luke S Spencer-Gardner, Cory G Couch, Naveen S Murthy, Michael J Taunton, Mario Hevesi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40499087/,"This study examined the prevalence of gluteal tendon issues, such as tears or inflammation, in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery for osteoarthritis.

40491210,2026-02-01,Primary Myoepithelioma of the Bone With HMGA2::WIF1 Fusion.,"Myoepithelial tumors are typically characterized by distinct molecular profiles that have been shown to correlate with their anatomical locations. EWSR1 or FUS rearrangements are common in cutaneous, soft tissue and bone tumors, whereas salivary gland myoepithelial tumors are frequently associated with PLAG1 and HMGA2 alterations. This apparent molecular divergence led some previous studies to doubt a common pathogenetic relationship between myoepithelial tumors of soft tissue and bone with their salivary gland counterparts. Herein, we present primary intraosseous myoepithelioma harboring HMGA2::WIF1 fusion. This fusion has been previously identified in a range of salivary gland myoepithelial tumors including myoepitheliomas, myoepithelial carcinomas arising from pleomorphic adenomas, and pleomorphic adenomas themselves. Primary myoepithelial tumors of the bone are exceedingly rare, and to our knowledge, HMGA2 rearrangements have not been previously reported in soft tissue or bone myoepithelial neoplasms. Through this report, we aim to enhance the existing literature on myoepithelial neoplasms, while highlighting the importance of recognizing primary bone myoepitheliomas and contributing to a broader understanding of the pathogenetic landscape of myoepithelial tumors across diverse tissue types.",International journal of surgical pathology,"Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Ahmed Shah|Kevin Halling|Doris Wenger|Judith Jebastin Thangaiah,Ahmed Shah|Kevin Halling|Doris Wenger|Judith Jebastin Thangaiah,"Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Ahmed Shah, Kevin Halling, Doris Wenger, Judith Jebastin Thangaiah",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40491210/,"This research paper examines a rare type of tumor called a primary myoepithelioma, which originates in the bone.

40488514,2026-02-01,Hurting More Than Helping? Decompressive Craniectomy in Patients With Symptomatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage After Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Insights From Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry.,"It remains unclear whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) is beneficial in patients who suffer symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We sought to study the effect of DC on functional outcomes in patients with sICH after AIS who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT).Patients with AIS from anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent MT and subsequently developed sICH were identified from the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry database. The primary outcome was acceptable 90-day functional neurological outcome, defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-3. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to identify and quantify risk factors.Of 464 patients identified with sICH after AIS after MT, 97 patients (20.9%) underwent DC. Patients who underwent DC were more likely to be female ( P < .001), younger ( P < .001), have a measured medical comorbidity, have higher baseline mRS ( P = .02), and have higher-grade hemorrhages ( P = .01). At 90 days, 14% of patients had the primary outcome of mRS 0-3 and 56% had died. The primary outcome was observed in 11 patients who underwent DC (11%) and 55 (15%) of those without DC (odds ratio [OR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.4, P = .40). DC did not affect mRS shift at 90 days ( P = .10) but was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8, P = .01). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that DC decreased the odds of primary outcome (adjusted OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02-0.9, P = .045), but did not affect mortality ( P = .94), mRS shift ( P = .50), or length of stay ( P = .90). Propensity-matched analysis similarly demonstrated that non-DC patients were more likely to achieve the primary outcome (24% vs 8%, P = .045).In patients with sICH after AIS after MT, those selected for DC had less favorable outcomes and similar rates of mortality at 90 days.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

Development of a systematic approach to choose the most appropriate route for this intervention, based on existing published evidence, is an important goal.To review the literature published since the 2018 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Guideline on surgical intervention for patients with sporadic VSs and use this information to update that set of recommendations.The literature in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from January 2015 through May 20, 2022, was searched for manuscripts pertaining to surgical intervention for VSs. Those manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria were then analyzed for creation of recommendations in response to a set of updated questions.The resultant findings included a considerable amount of data that did not alter the recommendations form the 2018 publication on this topic. Thus, recommendations stating hearing preservation surgery through the middle fossa or retrosigmoid approach may be considered in individuals with good preoperative hearing as an alternative to simple observation remain. In addition, if microsurgical resection is necessary after stereotactic radiosurgery, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a subtotal resection and decreased facial nerve function. In some questions, insufficient data were present to create an answer and that is stated.This guideline demonstrates surgical intervention for VSs and represents a range of options, and the choice of the intervention depends on the specific aspects of the lesion and the individual that harbors them. Objective refinement of those choices will require thoughtful research design by investigations that wish to address those items for which we still have insufficient information.

The researchers reviewed the latest scientific literature on surgical techniques for vestibular schwannomas, building on previous guidelines. They found that hearing-preservation surgery through the middle fossa or retrosigmoid approach may be considered for patients with good pre-operative hearing, as an alternative to simply monitoring the tumor.

40470956,2026-02-01,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guideline on the Role of Radiosurgery (Stereotactic Radiosurgery) and Radiation Therapy in the Management of Patients With Vestibular Schwannomas: Updates.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established modality for treatment of adult patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS). The aim of this work was to provide an updated literature review on this topic.To review the literature published since the last guideline on this topic.OVID MEDLINE and Embase were searched for the period January 1, 2015, to May 20, 2022, using search terms and search strategies to identify pertinent abstracts. These were then screened using published exclusion/inclusion criteria to identify full-text review articles. Evidence tables were constructed using data derived from full-text reviews and recommendations made from the evidence derived.From the total 1035 abstracts identified, 26 full-text articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in this update. Four new level III recommendations stemmed from this work. In adult patients with sporadic intracanalicular or <2 cm VS, SRS should not be recommended as superior to observation alone for hearing preservation. In adult patients with sporadic VS treated with SRS, cochlear dose constraint should be considered because it provides better hearing preservation than no constraint. In the same population, single fraction SRS should be recommended rather than hypofractionated SRS (>1 and ≤5 fractions) because it results in decreased cranial nerve dysfunction. Finally, adult patients with sporadic VS undergoing SRS should be informed that SRS does not result in an increased number of secondary malignancies compared with the rate expected in the overall population.Recent published literature provides new recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with VS with SRS.

41238062,2026-02-01,Long-term temporal trend in plaque eccentricity assessed through intravascular ultrasound imaging after heart transplantation.,"Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of graft failure and death after heart transplantation (HTx). Conventionally, CAV is characterized by concentric intimal thickening, however the long-term plaque progression patterns are elusive. This study aimed to assess the plaque characteristics in a temporal manner post-HTx using virtual histology intravascular ultrasonography (VH-IVUS).From 279 patients, we included 50 patients who underwent serial VH-IVUS assessment at three assessment points (A1: 0-1 year, A2: 3-5 years, A3: 7-10 years) post-HTx. Eccentricity index (EI) was defined as (maximum intimal thickness [MIT] - minimum intimal thickness)/MIT and evaluated in 39 patients with significant plaque (MIT > 0.50 mm at the A3). Differences in VH-IVUS findings between timepoints (Early: A1-2 [median 3.0] and Late: A2-3 [median 4.1 years]) were investigated.Of 50 patients, age was 51 ± 13 years, 36 (72 %) were males. In both Early and Late, the plaque volume index showed a significant increase, however, the rate of progression was significantly slower in Late (5.8 % vs 2.4 %, p = 0.015). The EI showed decrease in Early, compared to increase in Late (-0.040 vs 0.003, p = 0.036). Patients with higher EI change in Late had significantly lower proportion of fibrous plaque (p = 0.002) and higher dense calcium (p = 0.022) at A3.In the Late, HTx patients showed more eccentric plaque progression with lower fibrous plaque composition. These results suggest that typical and conventional atherosclerosis-like plaque progression can also occur in CAV during long-term follow-up, suggesting that treatment strategies based on insights into atherosclerosis may be useful.Copyright © 2025.

Determining these associations may clarify the AD-related biological pathways and support the development of integrated AD blood and ¹H-MRS biomarkers for early detection of these pathways. Fifty-five older adults (40 cognitively unimpaired; 15 mild cognitive impairment) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging underwent single-voxel ¹H-MRS (sLASER) at 3T in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left hippocampus (LH), along with plasma assays for Aβ42/40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and the p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio. Associations between plasma biomarkers and ¹H-MRS metabolites (myo-inositol [mIns]/total creatine [tCr], total N-acetylaspartate [tNAA]/tCr, and tNAA/mIns) were examined using partial Spearman correlations (rho, ρ) adjusted for age and sex. Next, associations of the Mini-Mental State Examination with p-tau181/Aβ42 and tNAA/mIns were examined adjusting for the same covariates plus education. In both PCG and LH regions, lower tNAA/mIns was associated with higher p-tau181/Aβ42 (PCG:ρ=-0.59; LH:ρ=-0.54) and p-tau181 (PCG: ρ=-0.38; LH:ρ =-0.39), as well as with lower Aβ42/40 (PCG:ρ=0.40; LH:ρ=0.32). Higher mIns/tCr was associated with higher p-tau181/Aβ42 (PCG: ρ=0.56; LH:ρ=0.46) and p-tau181 (PCG:ρ=0.37; LH:ρ=0.31). Lower PCG and LH tNAA/mIns ratios were associated with lower MMSE (PCG:ρ=0.53; LH:ρ=0.46), while higher p-tau181/Aβ42 was associated with lower MMSE (ρ=-0.49). ¹H-MRS-derived gliosis and neuronal injury biomarkers are associated with early AD pathology, and cognitive performance, supporting their use as noninvasive biomarkers in early AD.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This review aims to integrate the current evidence on the epidemiology and shared pathophysiology of CAD and AS, summarize the diagnostic algorithms for CAD in the TAVR population, and evaluates revascularization strategies with a focus on the timing of percutaneous coronary intervention relative to valve replacement. Current evidence suggests that while routine PCI in TAVR candidates for stable CAD may offer limited benefit, revascularization in patients with complex CAD or high anatomical burden may improve outcomes. This review further characterizes the incidence, proposed mechanisms, and prognostic significance of post-TAVR coronary events and outlines emerging strategies to optimize ischemic and procedural outcomes in this high-risk cohort.© 2025 The Authors.",American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,"Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Bahaa ED Wehbeh|Moied Al Sakan|Jamil Francis|Rachad Ghazal|Samir Alam|Fadi Sawaya,Rachad Ghazal,"Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.|Department of Cardiology, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.|Department of Internal Medicine, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, MI, USA.|Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Structural Heart and Valve Division, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.","Bahaa ED Wehbeh, Moied Al Sakan, Jamil Francis, Rachad Ghazal, Samir Alam, Fadi Sawaya",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41561402/,"This research paper examines the relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic stenosis (AS), a common heart valve condition.

41551324,2026-02-01,Systemic MOTS-c levels are increased in adults with obesity in association with metabolic dysregulation and remain unchanged after weight loss.,"MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA type-c) is a mitochondrial-derived peptide and regulator of metabolic homeostasis. Although its role in glucose and lipid metabolism is emerging, changes in circulating MOTS-c with obesity remain unclear. We hypothesized that circulating MOTS-c concentrations would be altered in obese vs. lean adults in associations with altered metabolic and inflammatory markers.Circulating MOTS-c levels, metabolic parameters, and inflammatory markers were compared between 22 lean controls and 32 obese participants scheduled for bariatric surgery. Longitudinal changes in weight, MOTS-c levels, and metabolic markers were also analyzed in 10 of the obese patients before and 6 months after bariatric surgery. Additionally, adipose tissue MOTS-c expression was assessed by immunofluorescence in lean kidney donors (n = 6) and obese (n = 14) subjects.Circulating MOTS-c levels were significantly higher in obese compared to lean individuals (273 ± 56 vs. 223 ± 50 pg/mL; P < 0.01). BMI and HOMA-IR independently predicted elevated MOTS-c levels (P = 0.035 and P = 0.032, respectively). MOTS-c showed a biphasic relationship with HOMA-IR, rising sharply above HOMA-IR of ∼ 6.6 mmol/L×µU/mL. Adipose tissue MOTS-c did not differ between the groups or correlate with circulating MOTS-c. Despite significant BMI improvements post-surgery (P < 0.001), circulating MOTS-c levels remained unchanged (P = 0.913).Circulating MOTS-c levels are elevated in obesity, exhibiting a nonlinear relationship with BMI and insulin resistance. MOTS-c may represent a compensatory metabolic response in obesity and insulin-resistant states, highlighting its potential as a clinical biomarker.

While prior studies have proposed optimal combined anteversion (CA) ranges to maximize impingement-free range of motion (IFROM), the influence of bony impingement and femoral head size remains underexplored. This study utilized computed tomography-based robotic planning software to identify a target CA that optimized IFROM and to evaluate the effect of head size.Five patients (mean age: 63.2 years) who underwent robotic-assisted THA were included. Using computed tomography-based planning software, femoral and acetabular version were systematically adjusted from 0° to 37°, simulating bony and implant impingement in flexion and internal rotation and extension and external rotation. Simulations were performed with 28-, 32-, 36-, and 40-mm heads, totaling 57,750 tests. Functional range of motion (ROM) was defined as ≥40° internal rotation at 90° flexion and ≥10° external rotation at 20° extension. For each head size, maximum IFROM and acceptable CA configurations meeting functional ROM criteria were recorded. A mathematical formula was developed to describe optimal CA per head size.For all patients and head sizes, the optimal CA was described by (acetabular anteversion+(0.7×femoral anteversion) = 36 and was independent of native version. Larger femoral heads were associated with broader functional ROM. Acceptable CA angles increased by 158% from 28 to 32 mm, 86% from 32 to 36 mm, and 31% from 36 to 40 mm.Larger femoral head sizes increase IFROM and expand the range of CA positions achieving functional ROM.

However, access to these centers is challenging for patients who experience neurologic deficits, leading to loss of independence and rendering travel difficult. Patients with low socio-economic status (SES) often lack logistical resources for travel, leading to poorer outcomes. There is a critical need for scalable telehealth solutions to increase access to specialized care. The Neuro-Oncology Anywhere 242 study systematically compares telehealth and in-person neuro-oncology assessments, as decentralization of care delivery may enable glioma patients with neurologic deficits and low SES to access specialized care and experience improved health outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to assess patient satisfaction with care delivered as measured by institutional Press-Ganey survey scores obtained following telehealth and in-person assessments. A key secondary objective is to assess the completion rate of planned oral chemotherapy among patients with glioma within 28 days of telehealth visits compared to in-person visits. Chemotherapy adherence is evaluated using a novel digital pill diary that has been developed for this study. Other secondary objectives include preference for telehealth versus in-person evaluations as well as acute care utilization, neurologic impairment, and quality of life among participants after telehealth versus in-person visits.

41504675,2026-02-01,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Evaluation and Management of Refractory Constipation: Expert Review.,"Although most patients with chronic constipation respond to medical therapy, a subset experiences refractory constipation (RC), which poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Because RC is relatively rare, clinicians should systematically (1) exclude correctable secondary causes such as medications, neurologic disorders, and defecatory disorders (DDs); (2) confirm the presence of slow colonic transit; and (3) ensure that patients have undergone adequate trials of over-the-counter and Food and Drug Administration-approved medications and nonpharmacologic therapies, including combinations thereof. Surgical treatments, such as colectomy, may be considered in patients who fail available treatments. However, surgical treatment of chronic constipation is associated with increased risk of complications and a not insignificant number of unsatisfactory outcomes. Prior to advising surgery, it is essential to confirm slow colonic transit, exclude concurrent DDs, and evaluate for severe, symptomatic delays in gastric emptying or small bowel dysmotility. Psychological comorbidities may exacerbate symptoms and adversely affect surgical outcomes. Hence, preoperative psychological evaluation is also advisable to assess suitability for surgery. Relative contraindications to surgical treatment of RC include clinically significant upper-gut dysmotility, severe, untreated psychiatric disease, and predominant complaints of bloating and/or abdominal pain. In uncertain cases, a temporary diverting loop ileostomy may help predict the potential response to colectomy. A colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis should only be offered to patients without ongoing DDs.This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

If no secondary causes are found, the next step is to confirm that the patient has slow movement of waste through the colon. For those who don't respond to laxatives and other non-surgical therapies, surgery like removing part of the colon may be an option, but it carries significant risks and doesn't always work. The experts caution that psychological factors can also play a role, so a comprehensive evaluation is crucial before considering surgery.

41503431,2026-02-01,Exploring the Role of Intraoperative Prolactin Levels in Surgical Management of Prolactinomas: Predicting Operative Success and Enhancing Surgical Decision-Making.,"Prolactinomas comprise half of all pituitary adenomas. This study explores the significance of measuring intraoperative (IO) prolactin (PRL) levels in guiding surgical decision-making and predicting operative success.Retrospective cohort study design of consecutive patients with prolactinomas who underwent transsphenoidal resection from June 2021 to May 2023. IO PRL was measured after tumor resection was completed. Remission was defined as normalization of PRL levels during follow-up without medication. Outcomes included factors associated with remission, utilizing significance thresholds at p  < 0.05.Thirteen patients were included with a 5.3-month median follow-up (range, 3-15 months). Most of the tumors were microadenomas (61%), with a median preoperative PRL level of 116 ng/mL (range, 25-471). Gross total resection was achieved in 69% of patients, all of whom attained remission. The median IO PRL was 19.8 ng/mL (range, 1-329), the postoperative day 1 PRL of 3.6 ng/mL (range, 1-203), and the latest PRL at 9.3 ng/mL (range, 1-137). A ≥40% decline in IO PRL from baseline was identified as the optimal cutoff for predicting biochemical remission, with 89% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and 85% accuracy.Monitoring PRL levels intraoperatively may be a useful biomarker aiding surgeon's assessment of the extent of tumor resection and guide surgical decision-making.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize studies on 2-stage exchange and débridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) to determine differences in rates of recurrent infection, risk factors for recurrent infection, noninfectious complications, and functional outcomes.A systematic search was conducted of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases in March 2024 to identify studies on infected TEAs treated with either 2-stage revision surgery or DAIR. Exclusion criteria included duplicate publications, review articles, and studies with a mean follow-up of less than 1 year. Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis. Data abstracted included demographics, treatment modalities, bacterial speciation, rates of recurrent infection, and functional outcomes (range of motion data and Mayo Elbow Performance Score.Two hundred ninety infected TEAs were included across all 14 studies, 131 treated with DAIR and 159 treated with 2-stage exchange. The overall pooled random-effects rate of recurrent infection was 34% (95% confidence interval: 21%-47%). The rate of recurrent infection was significantly lower following 2-stage exchange compared to DAIR (18% vs. 51%, P = .004). The overall pooled rate of noninfectious complications was 34% (95% confidence interval: 22%-46%). With the numbers available, the rate of noninfectious complications between 2-stage exchange and DAIR was smaller for 2-stage exchange, although the difference did not achieve statistical significance (27% vs. 43%, P = .244). Patients infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci experienced a higher rate of recurrent infection than those infected with other species (44% vs. 14%), although again this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .060). In patients undergoing 2-stage exchange, incomplete cement removal was associated with a significantly higher rate of recurrent infection than complete removal (56% vs. 19%, P = .001), but intentional retention of 1 component was not significantly associated with a higher rate of recurrent infection (37% vs. 20%, P = .315).The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcomes associated with the treatment of TEA periprosthetic joint infection with either DAIR or 2-stage reimplantation, 2-stage exchange was associated with a lower rate of recurrent infection.

Whole genome transcriptomic profiling offers a systems-based, unbiased approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ACR. However, noninvasive, longitudinal biomarker assessments capable of capturing the temporal dynamics of rejection biology remain scarce.RNA sequencing of peripheral blood from heart transplant recipients before, during, and after ACR was compared with nonrejection controls. Pathway analysis was conducted using differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and a machine learning approach was applied to assess gene-based prediction of ACR.A total of 235 rejection-specific significant DEGs and 863 postrejection DEGs (false discovery rate < 0.05) were identified. During ACR, DEGs were enriched for T-cell activation/differentiation, apoptosis, and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. By combining the 2 sets of DEGs, a panel of 71 common genes was identified that reflected the significant, longitudinal transcriptomic dynamics of ACR. In an elastic net machine learning-based classifier, DYNLL1 and SERF2 were identified as ACR predictive genes, and achieved a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.63.Peripheral blood transcriptomics identify dynamic temporal responses in ACR including T- and B-cell pathways with potential ACR predictive genes that warrant further investigation.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

They target a common network of brain regions, although relative involvement of cortical and subcortical regions differs. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are explicit in neurodegenerative disorders, however, little is known about their distribution in 4R-tauopathies.To evaluate the distribution of WMHs in the cortical and subcortical predominant 4R-tauopathies using venous territory-based and the derivative layer designed atlases.Ninety-five participants with clinical variants of PSP or CBS were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group, Mayo Clinic, and were classified as cortical (n = 64) or subcortical (n = 31) predominant. WMH volume was calculated for superficial, deep cerebral venous territory, and the periventricular (PV) region. Additionally, a layered atlas was created to assess WMH volume from the lateral ventricles (LV) to the brain surface. WMH volumes, clinical tests, and vascular-relevant histories were compared across groups and to 50 age-matched controls.Compared to the cortical group, the subcortical group had greater WMHs in the deep venous territory (p = 0.04). The major WMHs in the subcortical group distributed in layers 5-10 (12-30 mm from the LV) (p ≤ 0.01). The subcortical group had more histories of old strokes, chronic kidney disease, and headache.The distribution of WMHs in the deep cerebral venous territory and the presumed watershed zone suggests that dysfunction of the venous system may play a role in the pathomechanism of 4R-tauopathies, particularly subcortical variants.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

They found that patients with predominantly subcortical (deeper brain) involvement had more WMHs in the deep cerebral venous territory compared to those with predominantly cortical (outer brain) involvement. The subcortical group also had more WMHs in the presumed ""watershed"" zones between blood vessel territories, suggesting potential issues with the venous blood supply in this variant.

As such, there has been a recent evolution of both preoperative and intraoperative modalities to assist with planning and executing component placement. Robotic assistance is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration through either the ROSA or MAKO platforms. The authors have gained some preliminary experience with the MAKO robotic system, consisting of a robotic arm, camera system, and console. Use of this robot involves insertion of a fiducial marker or checkpoint and use of arrays with reflective discs on the coracoid, probe, robotic arm, and robotic registration array. After registration, the robotic arm effector end is used to sculpt bone for the baseplate, including preparation for central post or central screw fixation. At present time, the MAKO robotic arm can only be used for implantation of a primary reverse baseplate, with no features allowing anatomic glenoid implantation, humeral preparation, motion or soft tissue assessment, or revision surgery. Although reproducible accuracy and precision have been demonstrated relative to manual preparation and patient-specific instrumentation, substantial barriers to adoption include limited features, cost, surgical learning curve, additional operating room time, and little clinical outcome data.© 2025 The Author(s).","JSES reviews, reports, and techniques","Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Erick M Marigi,Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Erick M Marigi,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.","Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Erick M Marigi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41602509/,"In this study, researchers explored a new robotic-assisted technique for a common shoulder surgery called reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.

Younger participants from both EOAD and LOAD groups performed disproportionately worse on non-amnestic cognitive domains, with this occurring to a greater extent in EOAD than LOAD.In the age of disease-modifying treatments, results highlight the importance of assessing for cognitive declines in individuals starting much earlier than age 65.Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) participants each displayed cognitive impairments relative to same-aged peers across most domains. Both groups displayed positive relationships between impairment among non-amnestic cognitive domains and baseline age. This relationship displayed a significantly greater effect in EOAD than LOAD, with domains of Processing Speed/Attention and Executive Functioning skills being the most pronounced. Of those participants developing AD, age displayed a disproportionate impact on their symptom onset.© 2026 The Author(s).

41613494,2026-02-01,Surgical management of midventricular and apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"The diverse phenotypes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) - including subaortic, midventricular, and apical hypertrophy - present distinct surgical challenges. While transaortic septal myectomy remains the standard approach for relieving subaortic obstruction, it may not offer adequate exposure to the midventricle and apex, limiting its effectiveness in patients with midventricular obstruction (MVO), apical HCM, or complex long-segment septal hypertrophy. To address these potential limitations, surgeons at the Mayo Clinic have utilized a transapical incision for myectomy at the mid and distal portions of the left ventricle. Over the past three decades, transapical myectomy has proved to be a safe and effective adjunct or alternative surgical strategy. This approach offers direct visualization of the hypertrophied midventricular septum and papillary muscles, allowing for complete resection and relief of intracavitary gradients in MVO. In patients with apical HCM and diastolic heart failure, apical myectomy increases left ventricular end-diastolic volume and stroke volume, improving symptoms and exercise capacity. The transapical route also facilitates repair of apical aneurysms when present. Procedural morbidity and mortality are low, and we have observed durable symptomatic relief and favorable long-term survival. In select patients with advanced heart failure symptoms who are not candidates for, or wish to defer, heart transplantation, apical myectomy represents a viable and effective surgical alternative. This review outlines the clinical indications, surgical technique, and outcomes of transapical myectomy, underscoring its role in the contemporary surgical management of complex HCM phenotypes.© Indian Association of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgeons 2025.

41613490,2026-02-01,Extended septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - still the gold standard?,"Surgical septal myectomy remains the definitive treatment for symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), with symptomatic improvement in over 90% of patients, sustained relief of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and remarkably low operative mortality rates - less than 0.5% at experienced centers. The operation addresses septal hypertrophy and dynamic systolic anterior motion-mediated mitral valve (MV) regurgitation. Most patients require only isolated septectomy, and adjunctive MV procedures are reserved for patients with additional intrinsic MV pathology. Institutional volume strongly correlates with outcomes of transaortic septal myectomy; centers performing fewer than one myectomy annually have significantly higher rates of MV replacement and complications compared to high-volume institutions. Septal myectomy restores life expectancy to levels comparable with age- and sex-matched populations, and often exceeds outcomes seen with alcohol septal ablation, particularly in patients with marked hypertrophy or complex anatomy. Although novel pharmacologic therapies are emerging, surgical myectomy remains the gold-standard therapy for patients with refractory symptoms due to dynamic LVOT obstruction. Continued refinement of techniques and patient selection has solidified its role as one of the safest and most effective open-heart operations available.© Indian Association of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgeons 2025.

Stigma associated with HIV or mental illness can complicate meningitis, leading to misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis and care. The frequency of misdiagnosis and/or co-occurrence of meningitis and mental illness among people living with HIV (PLWH) remains uncertain. We explored the experiences of meningitis patients and the barriers and facilitators to care related to HIV stigma and mental illness.We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study to evaluate experiences of patients who were hospitalized with HIV-associated meningitis from February 2017 to May 2022 at Lira Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. Experiences among patients who survived and family members of patients who died were explored. Surveys were conducted to obtain demographic information, investigate stigma, and assess symptoms of mental illness. Semi-structured interviews probed the overall experience of patients with HIV and meningitis regarding social support, mental health, and stigma.Twenty-four patients with HIV-associated meningitis and 20 family members of deceased meningitis patients were enrolled. Family members reported that 80% of deceased patients experienced stigma, whereas 29.2% of surviving patients reported experiencing stigma. Combined responses from surviving patients and family members identified 31.8% of patients with mental illness symptoms described as overthinking, depression, and/or anxiety, while 60.8% experienced HIV-related stigma. Among participants who died, family members reported mental illness symptoms in 40%, compared to self-reports of 25% in survivors. Barriers to HIV care included (a) lack of HIV education, (b) mental illness symptoms, (c) lack of social support, and (d) stigma or shame. While common facilitators were (a) access to HIV clinics and ART medication, (b) having a life purpose, and (c) social support.Stigma and symptoms of mental illness were common among patients with HIV and meningitis, which likely affected antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV care. Recommendations include (1) adding mental health screening during hospital admission for all meningitis patients, especially among PLWH, for early evaluation and treatment and (2) increasing community awareness to dispel misconceptions and reduce HIV-related stigma.© 2026 The Author(s).

41612787,2026-02-01,Mosaic Li Fraumeni Syndrome Not Identified in Germinal Tissue.,"Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary multi-cancer syndrome caused by alterations in TP53 (MIM# 151623). Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the detection of TP53 variants at lower variant allele frequencies (VAFs). A TP53 variant with a VAF < 50% may represent mosaic LFS, aberrant clonal expansion (ACE), or possible circulating tumor DNA. Differentiation among these conditions is important for optimal patient management.Genetic testing was performed using a custom gene panel, with an average read depth of 350× (range 166-553×). DNA extracted from four different tissues (blood, saliva, cultured skin fibroblasts, and colon) was sequenced.Here, we describe an adult female patient with a history of an adrenocortical neoplasm and osteosarcoma, diagnosed at 2 and 16 years of age, respectively. Testing of peripheral blood identified a pathogenic TP53 variant, c.733G>A, p.(Gly245Ser) (NM_000546.6); however, subsequent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) did not identify this TP53 variant in any of nine embryos tested. Testing for possible mosaicism in the proband was performed on four different specimens, revealing variable VAFs of the TP53 variant (saliva: 44%; blood: 31%; cultured skin fibroblasts: 18%; and colon tissue: 9%). These results suggest a post-zygotic event, consistent with mosaic LFS rather than ACE.This case highlights the complexity of interpreting mosaic variants in the TP53 gene, and we propose a testing algorithm to aid in the delineation of this phenomenon when relaying cancer and reproductive risk information in the context of mosaicism.© 2025 The Author(s).

The researchers used advanced genetic testing techniques to analyze DNA samples from the woman's blood, saliva, skin, and colon. They found that she had a specific mutation in the TP53 gene, but interestingly, this mutation was present at different levels in her various tissue samples. This suggested that the mutation occurred after she was born, rather than being inherited from her parents. This type of genetic change, known as mosaicism, can make LFS more difficult to diagnose and manage.

A notable milestone in this journey was the first-in-human transfer of an exogenous gene to a joint, accomplished by the ex vivo delivery of cDNA encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) to joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Responding to lessons learned from this study and the prevailing clinical landscape we next developed an in vivo gene delivery system based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) with osteoarthritis (OA) as the target disease. The safety and efficacy of this vector, sc-rAAV2.5IL-1Ra, was demonstrated in the joints of rats and horses leading to a successful IND application to the FDA. In this clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02790723) sc-rAAV2.5IL-1Ra was injected at escalating doses into the knee joints of nine patients with OA who were followed for 1 year. This trial met its primary outcome measure, safety, and demonstrated that sustained expression of transgenic IL-1Ra was possible after a single injection of the vector. Patient-reported outcomes improved, but without a control group it is not possible to determine the influence of a placebo effect. This and other unresolved matters are addressed in a recently-completed Phase Ib trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05835895). Beyond OA, sc-rAAV2.5IL-1Ra has potential therapeutic value in a variety of degenerative, inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune conditions. More generally, gene therapy holds much promise in the field of regenerative medicine, including regenerative orthopaedics.

They first tested this approach in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, successfully delivering a gene that produces an anti-inflammatory protein. Building on this success, the team then developed a more targeted gene therapy using a modified virus to carry the therapeutic gene into the joints of patients with osteoarthritis. After demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of this treatment in animal studies, the researchers conducted a clinical trial in which they injected the gene therapy directly into the knees of 9 people with osteoarthritis.

We reviewed 747 consecutive 3 T wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies for evidence of FI in the thenar muscles. This population was divided into two cohorts based on radiographic analysis: a cohort without thumb CMC OA (n = 440) and a second cohort with thumb CMC OA (n = 307), staged according to the Eaton-Littler classification. Statistical analysis using logistic regression was performed to investigate clinical factors associated with the presence of FI in the thenar muscles. FI was present in 133 patients with CMC OA (43.3%). FI, when present, was located only in the OPP. We found no OPP FI in the cohort without CMC OA (440 patients). Among patients with CMC OA, increasing age, male sex and advanced OA stage were significantly associated with the presence of OPP FI. OPP FI is a frequent finding in CMC OA. This FI could affect the biomechanical function of the OPP. In the future, we plan to analyze clinical outcomes in CMC OA patients with and without FI, and more focused in vivo studies of OPP function. OPP FI could potentially affect the function and the stability of the thumb CMC joint in patients with CMC OA. Orthopaedic Research Society.

The purpose of our study was to identify risk factors of AF and SSF after rTSA through a detailed systematic review of published literature.A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to October 2023. We included all peer-reviewed studies investigating the risk of AF and SSF after rTSA, excluding biomechanical studies. A total of 1,047 publications were reviewed, and 25 publications with a total of 100,205 shoulders met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of these publications was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate risks for categorical variables (gender, osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, and surgical history). Mean differences (MD) and standard deviations were used to determine the effect of continuous variables, such as age and body mass index (BMI).The pooled reported rate of AF and SSF was 2%. Our analyses identified a higher risk of AF and SSF in patients with osteoporosis (OR = 2.33, P = .004), inflammatory arthritis (OR = 2.19, P < .001), females (OR = 1.98, P < .001), and prior rotator cuff repair (OR = 2, P = .049). History of any shoulder surgery or prior acromioplasty were not associated with risk of fracture (P > .05). Patients with AF and SSF were older (MD = 1.82, P < .001) and presented a lower BMI (MD = -1.08, P < .001).Patients who suffered AF or SSF after rTSA were older with lower BMI. Other risk factors identified included osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, female gender, and previous rotator cuff repair. There is, however, a need for further investigations into additional crucial factors, such as prosthesis type and design and lateralization of components, as these variables could significantly influence complication rates and patient outcomes following rTSA.© 2025 The Authors.","JSES reviews, reports, and techniques","Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Khaled A Elmenawi|John W Sperling|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Jonathan D Barlow,Khaled A Elmenawi|John W Sperling|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Jonathan D Barlow,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Khaled A Elmenawi, John W Sperling, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Jonathan D Barlow",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41602508/,"This research study examined the risk factors for two rare but serious complications that can occur after a type of shoulder replacement surgery called reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA).

We queried whether preoperative 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) had prognostic value for recurrence or metastasis.Retrospective review of patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT before resection of SFT between January 2002 and June 2023. Independent review of slides by a pulmonary pathologist and radiologist review of FDG-PET/CT were performed. Statistical analyses included nonparametric tests for correlations, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.There were 34 patients with a preoperative FDG-PET/CT before SFT resection. Median tumor SUVmax was 2.3 (range: 0.9-38.7). Recurrence occurred in five patients (14.7%) (three local, two metastatic). Tumor SUVmax was associated with tumor size (p < 0.001), parietal pleural origin (p = 0.027), hypercellularity (p = 0.049), mitoses (p < 0.001), and Ki67 (p = 0.015). SUVmax correlated with the modified Demicco score (p < 0.001) and Tapias score (p < 0.001). Prediction of recurrence was excellent with SUVmax (area under ROC curve [AUC] = 0.872, p < 0.001), Tapias score (AUC = 0.914, p < 0.001), and modified Demicco score (AUC = 0.821, p < 0.001). Time-dependent ROC analysis identified SUVmax more than or equal to 2.4 as high risk for recurrence. Recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 92.9%, 83.6%, 69.6%, and 46.4%, respectively, in patients with SUVmax more than or equal to 2.4, but it was 100% at all time points with SUVmax less than 2.4 (p = 0.002). SUVmax was not associated with overall survival in this small cohort.Tumor metabolic activity on FDG-PET/CT is predictive of SFT recurrence. Preoperative SUVmax correlates with known histopathologic high-risk features and validated risk scores.

Therefore, this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is intended to provide Best Practice Advice on the evaluation and management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD. We have developed Best Practice Advice statements to address 13 key clinical issues.This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Prompt hospitalization should be considered for adult patients with IBD who present with severe disease refractory to outpatient treatment when there is high suspicion for an IBD-related complication, such as intestinal obstruction or intra-abdominal abscess, or when there is significant nutritional risk or failure to thrive. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The initial management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD should include supportive care. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: The initial management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD should include an evaluation for IBD-related complications and concomitant infections. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Hospitalized adult patients with IBD should have their disease activity assessed with both biomarkers and endoscopic evaluation, when indicated. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Hospitalized adult patients with IBD should receive prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of venous thromboembolism. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should be counseled on the potential need for colectomy and should have a timely referral for surgical consultation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should receive initial treatment with intravenous corticosteroids at a methylprednisolone 60-mg daily dose equivalent. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should be monitored for treatment response within 72 hours of medical treatment initiation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Preparations should be made for initiating rescue therapy in hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis who are not responsive to intravenous corticosteroid treatment.

In recent years, there has been an increasing body of work assessing the healing environment of the injured rotator cuff and exploring which adjuncts may be suitable to augment repairs.In this review, we summarize the best available literature regarding the biology of rotator cuff healing and the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), scaffold-, and graft-based augmentations to RCR to guide the treating clinician.Proposed treatment modalities range from injection-based augmentation such as PRP and BMAC to scaffold and graft-based augmentations at the time of RCR.The field of biologic augmentation for RCR is rapidly evolving and has demonstrated substantial potential in improving structural integrity and healing rates. PRP, BMAC, as well as scaffold- or graft-based strategies, have all shown promise; however, variability in study methodology, preparation techniques, and clinical outcomes continue to limit definitive recommendations.

In this decision analytical model study, the validated Colorectal Cancer Adenoma Incidence and Mortality model incorporated updated aggregate test performance data to estimate the benefit-to-burden ratio of stool-based screening tests across recommended intervals and age ranges and identify the efficient strategies.Screening strategies of multitarget stool DNA or fecal immunochemical tests at 1-3-year intervals over various age ranges were evaluated for average-risk individuals in the U.S. Performance inputs for an updated marker panel (next-generation multitarget stool DNA) and fecal immunochemical tests were obtained from a meta-analysis. The primary analysis was an efficient frontier generated for life-years gained (benefit) compared with no screening versus the number of lifetime colonoscopies (burden) for each screening strategy. Strategies are efficient if no other strategy provides more life-years gained with equivalent or fewer colonoscopies and are near efficient if they are within 3 days of life-years gained of the efficient frontier.All screening strategies resulted in positive life-years gained versus no screening (178-352 life-years gained/1,000 individuals).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and their next-generation co-agonists exert potent weight-lowering and cardiometabolic effects and may therefore confer antiarrhythmic effects. This meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively assess the effect of GLP-1-based therapies on the risk of AF among individuals with overweight or obesity.A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through October 29, 2025. Data were analyzed using random-effects pairwise meta-analysis.Twenty-four RCTs encompassing 40,694 participants were included. Compared with placebo, treatment with GLP-1RAs or co-agonists resulted in a 18 % relative reduction in AF risk (Risk Ratio = 0.82; 95 % confidence interval, 0.70-0.96; P = 0.012; I2 = 0 %).

Among 51 patients included in the efficacy evaluable set, the objective response rate was 6·3% (95% CI 0·2-30·2; one confirmed partial response) in cohort A1, 30·0% (6·7-65·3; three confirmed partial responses) in cohort A2, 23·1% (5·0-53·8; three confirmed partial responses) in cohort B, and 0% in cohort C. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events included hypertension in 17 (31%) of 55 patients, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in seven (13%) patients, and stomatitis in six (11%) patients. Grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in two (4%) of 55 patients (increased lipase [n=1] and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [n=1]); no grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were reported.These findings suggest that tinengotinib might have activity in patients with cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions that progressed following FGFR inhibitor therapy. Anti-tumour activity was also observed in patients with other FGFR alterations.

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition where the body struggles to properly regulate blood sugar levels, often requiring insulin injections to manage the condition. The researchers wanted to see if an automated system that continuously monitors blood sugar and automatically adjusts insulin delivery could benefit these patients.

The study involved adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, some of whom had an autoimmune marker called GAD65 antibodies. The researchers had the participants use an automated insulin delivery system for several months and compared their outcomes to a control group using standard insulin treatment. The key finding was that the automated system led to significantly better blood sugar control in both groups, regardless of the presence of GAD65 antibodies. This suggests the automated system can be beneficial for a wide range of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes patients.

There is a lack of data regarding biomolecular changes with EN, particularly concerning PBFs. This pilot study examines tolerance and changes in metabolic panels, including fatty acids and metabolomics, during the transition to a high-protein (100 % whey), fish oil-fortified, peptide-based formula (HP/FO w-PBF).A pilot single-center prospective cohort study was conducted at a quaternary care center. Adult HEN-dependent participants switched from a standard polymeric formula (SPF) to HP/FO w-PBF for 14 days during their outpatient HEN follow-up routine visits. Participants completed a daily consumption and tolerance diary and collection of plasma at enrollment and the end of the study.Twenty-five participants (72 % female) with a mean age of 60.3 ± 16.3 years completed the study, with 18 completing baseline and end-of-study blood tests for metabolomics and 17 for metabolic panel and fatty acid profile. Compared to baseline, C-peptide and insulin levels increased by a median of 36 % and 13 %, respectively, possibly reflecting an insulinotropic effect of whey protein. Omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, plasma levels increased significantly by a median of 469 % and 143 %, respectively. Metabolomics analyses noted essential amino acid enrichment. A significant rise in arginine metabolites, such as ornithine, was observed, indicating possible utilization by cells such as enterocytes.A high-protein (100 % whey), fish-oil-enriched, peptide-based formula was tolerated by participants and demonstrated increased levels of essential amino acids, as well as a boost in ω-3 fatty acids.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the prevalence and types of dermatologic AEs associated with mood stabilizers in patients with BD.We searched Ovid MEDLINE®, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO from 1970 for studies on dermatologic AEs in BD patients treated with lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, or lamotrigine (CRD42022357268). Two reviewers handled study selection, data extraction, and bias risk assessment. Meta-analyses estimated prevalence rates for dermatologic AEs.Out of 6980 studies identified, 50 met the inclusion criteria. Lithium was associated with acneiform eruptions in 4.2 % (95 % CI: 1.0-16.2 %), rash in 1.3 % (95 % CI: 0.4-4.3 %), and hair loss in 1.9 % (95 % CI: 0.5 %-6.3 %) of patients. For valproate, hair loss was observed in 4.6 % of patients (95 % CI: 3.0-6.7 %) and rash in 2.9 % (95 % CI: 1.6-5.3 %). Carbamazepine was associated with rash in 6.0 % of patients (95 % CI: 4.4-7.6 %), but severe reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis were not reported. Lamotrigine had the highest rash prevalence with 9.2 % (95 % CI: 7.2-11.8 %), while severe reactions were rare (0.04 %, 95 % CI: 0.00-0.62 %).Heterogeneity in study designs and outcome definitions, reliance on self-reporting or assessments by non-dermatologists, frequent use of concomitant medications.Mood stabilizers showed varying levels of dermatologic AEs, but severe reactions were rare.

Outcomes included complete response (CR) rate, duration of response, adverse events, and high-grade recurrence-free (HGRFS), cystectomy-free, and overall survival.Forty-six patients were treated with nadofaragene firadenovec; 3 with pending posttreatment cystoscopy were excluded. Of 24 evaluable patients with carcinoma in situ with/without papillary disease, 79% had a CR at 3 months. The median response duration was not reached; 68% (13/19) of responders still had CRs with median follow-up of 9.3 months. Of 19 patients with papillary-only disease (median follow-up of 7.6 months), HGRFS at 3, 6, and 12 months was 68%, 53%, and 26%, respectively. With median follow-up of 13.9 months, cystectomy-free and overall survival were 93% and 95%, respectively. Progression occurred in 5 patients. The most common adverse events were grade 1-2 bladder spasms (61%) and failure to fully retain the instillation (33%). Four patients had grade 3 events; there were no grade 4 or 5 events.

The AtaCor parasternal EV-ICD system uses an extravascular lead along the left parasternum to deliver defibrillation and pacing therapy from outside the heart.This pilot study analysis evaluates implant success, acute performance, and 30-day safety of the parasternal EV-ICD system.Patients with a class I or IIa indication for ICD therapy were implanted with the parasternal EV-ICD system and underwent acute defibrillation testing. End points included acute defibrillation success and 30-day freedom from major complications.19 patients were enrolled, of whom 79% had a primary ICD indication. The majority (56%) had an ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 47% ± 18%. The lead was successfully deployed in 19 of 19 attempted implant procedures (100%). Defibrillation testing was performed in 18 patients and was successful in 17 patients (94%). Freedom from major complications was 95% (95% confidence interval 74% to >99%) at 30 days. Intraprocedural pacing capture with the dedicated bipolar pacing vector was achieved in 17 of 17 chronically implanted subjects (100%). Pacing was well tolerated among patients at the predischarge visit.These results show that the AtaCor parasternal EV-ICD system is feasible and safe, with high defibrillation efficacy in induced ventricular arrhythmias and a low occurrence of major complications within 30 days. By combining an extravascular approach with the ability to deliver antitachycardia pacing and defibrillation, the parasternal EV-ICD may provide a viable alternative to conventional ICD therapy.Copyright © 2025 Heart Rhythm Society.

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of preoperative administration of iodine solution in patients with Graves disease undergoing a total thyroidectomy.Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles since its inception to August 2024. The review was registered prospectively on the PROSPERO database (CRD42024585797).From the 2,243 studies screened, 11 studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 2,257 patients with Graves disease undergoing a total thyroidectomy either with iodine solution (n = 760) or control (n = 1,497) groups. Our study demonstrated that the iodine solution group had similar outcomes compared with the control group with regard to intraoperative estimated blood loss (mean difference = -24.6 mL, 95% confidence interval: -56.2, 7.0; I2 = 82%), operative time (mean difference = -2.3 minutes, 95% confidence interval: -10.6, 6.0; I2 = 68%), endocrine-related complications (odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.42, 1.74; I2 = 76%), hypocalcemia (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.91; I2 = 61%), hematoma (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.39, 5.29; I2 = 58%) or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (odds ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 1.93; I2 = 53%).This meta-analysis demonstrates that preoperative iodine solution and control groups had similar clinical outcomes when undergoing total thyroidectomy for Graves disease.

41356175,2026-02-01,Primary graft dysfunction prevention strategies in the perioperative period.,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality after heart and lung transplantation. It results from a multifactorial process involving ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammatory and immune responses, and donor-, recipient-, and procedural factors. Despite advances in perioperative management, PGD continues to adversely affect both short- and long-term transplant outcomes.This narrative review synthesizes contemporary evidence and consensus recommendations from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and recent clinical studies to delineate perioperative strategies aimed at preventing PGD in heart and lung transplantation. Focus areas include donor and recipient optimization, organ preservation strategies, intraoperative management, and emerging perfusion technologies.In heart transplantation, modifiable factors such as pre-transplant amiodarone exposure and donor-recipient mismatch increase PGD risk. Among preservation methods, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion has demonstrated reductions in PGD incidence, while controlled hypothermia has been associated with reduced PGD rates in observational studies. Normothermic ex vivo perfusion has shown improved graft preservation. In lung transplantation, the use of low-potassium dextran preservation solutions is associated with lower PGD rates. Ex vivo lung perfusion improves allograft utilization and may reduce PGD incidence. Implantation techniques such as off-pump lung transplantation or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, rather than cardiopulmonary bypass, have been associated with lower PGD rates.Every step of the transplant process is important in reducing the risk of PGD. Emerging machine perfusion technologies represent a promising advancement to enhance graft utilization, reduce PGD incidence, and improve overall outcomes following heart and lung transplantation.© 2025 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.",JHLT open,"Feb, 2026",2026.0,Feb,,Jérémie Guillemin|Michael Cutrone|Suraj Yalamuri|Monica Arndt|Adrien Bouglé|Sharon L McCartney,Suraj Yalamuri,"Adult Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, Sorbonne University, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France.|Sorbonne Université, GRC 29, Groupe de Recherche Clinique en Anesthésie Réanimation médecine Périopératoire, ARPE, Paris, France.|APHP, Hôpital La Pitié-Salpêtrière, DMU DREAM, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Paris, France.|Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.|Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota.","Jérémie Guillemin, Michael Cutrone, Suraj Yalamuri, Monica Arndt, Adrien Bouglé, Sharon L McCartney",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41356175/,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a serious complication that can occur after heart and lung transplant surgeries, leading to increased illness and even death for patients.

The study period was divided into 4 phases: pre-COVID-19 (2017-2020), early pandemic (2020-2021), mid-pandemic (2021-2022), and late pandemic (2022-2023). Mixed-effects poisson regression estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR), and difference-in-differences assessed temporal trends.The cohort included 239,804 women with a median age of 57 years, of whom 34.9% resided in rural counties. By race, 92% were White, 3.1% Black, 0.4% American Indians, 0.1% Native Hawaiians, 3% Asian, and 1.3% others. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, there was a significant decrease in MBCS rate in the early pandemic (IRR=0.891, P<.001), and though the rate improved in the mid-pandemic and late pandemic periods, they remained below the prepandemic level (IRR=0.941, P<.001; IRR=0.922, P<.001, respectively). Rural counties had lower MBCS rates compared with urban (IRR = 0.914, P<.001). Compared to White race, other races had lower MBCS rates with the Black race having the lowest (IRR=0.692, P<.001). Difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the relative gap between MBCS rates in minority/rural groups did not significantly widen or narrow during the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with sustained declines in MBCS through early 2023, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations but did not widen pre-existing disparities, highlighting the benefits of targeted interventions.© 2025 The Authors.","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

However, their structural similarity and low physiological concentrations pose analytical challenges in clinical laboratories. This study evaluates the utility of differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for improving the specificity and sensitivity of steroid measurements in serum (estrogens) and scalp hair (glucocorticoids) using a SelexION-equipped Sciex 6500+ mass spectrometer coupled to a high throughput Thermo Scientific TLX-2 LC system. DMS significantly reduced chromatographic interferences and enhanced signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios-up to 420 % for estradiol and 210 % for estrone. For cortisol and cortisone in hair, DMS also reduced interferences and increased S/N, as well as improving fragment ion agreement as evidenced by the reduction in fragment ion calculated concentration discrepancies exceeding ±20 % from 18 to 8 samples for cortisol and from 23 to 2 samples for cortisone.

Increased interbody size offers better immediate segmental lordosis and disc height restoration but may increase the risk of subsequent subsidence. Our objective was to identify factors for subsidence and segmental lordosis loss following ACDF.The charts of patients undergoing 1-3 level ACDF at a single-institution were queried for demographics, pre- and postoperative radiographic alignment, bone health (Hounsfield units on CT), procedural details, and interbody characteristics. Outcomes of interest were subsidence ≥2 mm and ≥3° loss in segmental lordosis (SL).199 patients (median 61.5 yr; 52.8 % male) were included - 98 single-level; 70 two-level, and 31 three-level. Forty treated levels (12.1 %) ≥3° decrease in SLand 19 (5.7 %) experienced ≥2 mm subsidence. Levels showing ≥3° loss of correction occurred in older patients (p = 0.021) and those with greater postoperative C2-7 lordosis (p = 0.002), postoperative SL (p < 0.001), and perioperative change in SL (p < 0.001). Subsidence was associated with allograft spacer use, lower postoperative segmental lordosis (p = 0.022) and greater postoperative disc height (p = 0.023). Decreased time to loss of SL was predicted by greater postoperative C2-7 lordosis (HR 1.04 per °; 95 % CI [1.00, 1.08]; p = 0.041) and greater postoperative SL (HR 1.27 per °; [1.13, 1.43]; p < 0.001). Shorter subsidence time was predicted by allograft [versus titanium] spacer use (HR 21.40; [5.61, 81.54]; p < 0.001) and greater postoperative disc height (HR 1.63 per mm; [1.37, 1.94]; p < 0.001).Greater disc height predicted subsequent subsidence and greater SL restoration predicted SL loss following 1-3 level ACDF.

41428499,2026-02-01,Proposed Development of a New Staging System for Hearing Loss: Countermeasure 2 of the Hearing Health Collaborative.,"Hearing loss is a highly prevalent disease state affecting almost 1 in 5 individuals globally. Growing research shows that untreated or undertreated hearing loss carries significant long-term sequelae, including increased risk of social isolation, depression, and cognitive decline, among other ramifications. Limited awareness and common misperceptions among the general US adult population and primary care providers contribute to low rates of referral to hearing specialty clinics and underutilization of hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other rehabilitative devices. Comprised of diverse membership, the Hearing Health Collaborative (HHC) was formed in May 2021 to identify and overcome challenges impacting good health care practices and public policy on hearing care in connection with healthy aging. This editorial documents a recent outcome of the HHC derived from a structured A3 process. Specifically, initiative 2, a proposal to develop a simple, clinically anchored staging system primarily for use by frontline providers and patients, is presented.

We describe 2 patients who expand the molecular and pathologic spectrum of HSPB8 disorder.We reviewed clinical and laboratory data and performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore variant effect.Patient 1 is an adult man presenting with childhood-onset, distal lower limb weakness, followed by proximal weakness. EMG detected predominant myopathic and neurogenic changes in upper and lower limbs, respectively. Biopsy revealed myopathy with rimmed vacuoles in the supraspinatus and neurogenic changes in the tibialis anterior. He carries a novel, predicted deleterious HSPB8 heterozygous variant, c.185G>A (p. Gly62Asp). Patient 2 is an adult man presenting with distal, asymmetric, progressive lower limb weakness that extended to proximal and neck muscles. Quadriceps biopsy showed myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregates, especially TIA1, p62, and TDP-43. TIA1 aggregates were more prominent than Z-disk protein accumulation. He carries a known HSPB8 pathogenic variant, c.421 A>G (p.Lys141Glu). Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that p.Gly62Asp may exert its effects through post-translation modifications while p.Lys141Glu may disrupt dimerization.HSPB8 p.Gly62Asp is the first N-terminal variant associated with myopathy.

41412391,2026-02-01,Spermidine deficiency induces BNIP3/LC3B-mediated mitophagy in the salivary glands of accelerated aging mice.,"Aging is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and altered autophagic processes, particularly in secretory organs such as the salivary glands. In this study, we investigated metabolic changes and their interactions with mitophagy in primary salivary gland cells (PSGCs) from klotho-deficient (kl-/-) mice, a model of accelerated aging. We observed a significant reduction in both mitochondrial number and mitochondrial DNA copy number in the PSGCs of kl-/- mice compared with those of wild-type (WT) controls. In contrast, lysosomal abundance was markedly increased in PSGCs from kl-/- mice. Moreover, the expression of the autophagy marker LC3B was significantly upregulated in kl-/- PSGCs, and the expression of the mitophagy markers BNIP3 and NIX increased. Our metabolomic profiling revealed disrupted spermidine biosynthesis in the salivary glands of kl-/- mice. Interestingly, spermidine treatment in kl-/- PSGCs increased the number of mitochondria and suppressed mitophagy, as indicated by the reduced expression of BNIP3 and LC3B. Conversely, in WT PSGCs, spermidine induced the expression of autophagy and mitophagy markers, namely, BNIP3 and LC3B. These findings suggest that accelerated aging in mice impairs mitochondrial homeostasis and alters autophagy/mitophagy pathways in salivary gland cells, potentially through the dysregulation of spermidine metabolism. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of aging in salivary glands and reveal the potential role of polyamine metabolism in maintaining mitophagy during aging.Copyright © 2024.

Baseline radiographic parameters, bone quality in CT Hounsfield units (HU), and paraspinal musculature cross-sectional area (CSA) at L3 and the UIV. Patients were subdivided into type 1-3 PJK based upon the Yagi-Boachie scale. Time-dependent analyses with univariable Cox proportional hazards model were performed.206 patients were included (59.7 % female; median age 67.1); 26.9 % experienced PJK - 52.5 % type 1, 27.8 % type 2, and 19.7 % type 3. Univariable comparisons showed PJK patients had lower HU at the UIV (137 vs 151; p = 0.047) and UIV+ 1 (137 vs 151; p = 0.028); mean multifidus CSA (p = 0.21) was also nonsignificantly smaller. Average HU were lower in type 2 PJK patients relative to non-PJK and type 1 PJK (p < 0.001). Type 2 failure was predicted by UIV/UIV+ 1, UIV, and UIV+ 1 average HU (all p < 0.01) while type 1 failure was predicted by UIV multifidus CSA (p = 0.03); average HU did not predict type 1 failure.Poor bone quality may be the strongest predictor of PJK; however, subanalysis by PJK type suggests it only increases the odds of bony or implant/bone interface failure. Decreased multifidus CSA appears to confer risk for type 1 (discoligamentous) PJK, suggesting PJK failure mode is dictated by the interplay of UIV bony and soft tissue integrity.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

By examining functional neuroimaging data - which shows how different parts of the brain are activated during certain tasks or mental states - the researchers aimed to better understand the underlying neurological mechanisms of catatonia. 

The key findings suggest that catatonia is associated with altered activity in brain regions involved in motor control, emotion processing, and cognitive function.

Anesthetic drugs administered to immature animals may cause neurohistopathologic changes and alterations in behavior. The authors studied association between anesthetic exposure before age 4 yr and the development of reading, written language, and math learning disabilities. This was a population-based, retrospective birth cohort study. The educational and medical records of all children born to mothers residing in five townships of Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 to 1982 and who remained in the community at 5 yr of age were reviewed to identify children with learning disabilities. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for anesthetic exposure as a predictor of learning disabilities, adjusting for gestational age at birth, sex, and birth weight. Of the 5,357 children in this cohort, 593 received general anesthesia before age 4 yr. Compared with those not receiving anesthesia (n = 4,764), a single exposure to anesthesia (n = 449) was not associated with an increased risk of learning disabilities (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.27). However, children receiving two anesthetics (n = 100) or three or more anesthetics (n = 44) were at increased risk for learning disabilities (hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.37; and hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.60 to 4.24, respectively). The risk for learning disabilities increased with longer cumulative duration of anesthesia exposure (expressed as a continuous variable; P = 0.016). Exposure to anesthesia was a significant risk factor for the later development of learning disabilities in children receiving multiple but not single anesthetics.

In spaceflight, crewmembers are exposed to a vast mixture of radiation species and energies including cosmic rays (CR) from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar ejections, and neutrons. Any trip beyond the protection of the Earth's electromagnetic field will expose astronauts to the near-maximum levels of lifetime allowable radiation exposure. We have previously reviewed how microgravity induces pathophysiological adaptations in the spine and how countermeasure strategies can play a role in minimizing astronaut morbidity.

41376595,2026-02-01,Vascular Toxicities of Cancer Therapies: 2025 Update.,"Advances in cancer therapies have transformed many malignancies into chronic or manageable conditions, but have been linked to adverse, including cardiovascular, events. Vascular toxicities associated with cancer treatment range from abnormal vasoreactivity to accelerated atherosclerosis, arterial thrombotic events, vasculitis, and arterial aneurysms or dissections. 5-fluorouracil and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors are the agents most commonly linked to abnormal vasoreactivity, whereas BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Arterial thrombotic events are seen with VEGF and BCR-ABL inhibitors as well as platinum drugs. Vasculitis emerged with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and arterial aneurysms and dissections with VEGF inhibitors. Radiation therapy can lead to several of the outlined vascular toxicities. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms of vascular complications associated with chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and radiation therapy.

However, the impact on longitudinal markers of iron status and inflammation are unknown. Further, it is unknown if iron studies obtained early in acute illness may moderate i.v. iron treatment responses.This is a planned analysis from a randomised clinical trial of critically ill adults with haemoglobin levels <10 g dl-1 receiving i.v. iron vs standard care on haemoglobin recovery and clinical outcomes through 3 months post-hospitalisation. Iron assays, erythropoietin levels, haemoglobin, and inflammatory markers were obtained at enrollment and 1 and 3 months post-hospitalisation. Between-group differences and correlations between laboratory values were evaluated at each timepoint. Treatment-related haemoglobin responses were evaluated by baseline laboratory parameters in interaction analyses.A total of 100 patients were included: 49 intervention and 51 standard care. The intervention group achieved higher haemoglobin (adjusted mean difference, 0.69 [95% confidence interval, 0.13-1.25] g dl-1, P=0.015 at 1 month) and ferritin (multiple increase, 2.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-3.9] ng/ml, P<0.001 at 1 month) values post-hospitalisation. There were no significant differences in other laboratory values over time. Ferritin and transferrin saturation, but not soluble transferrin receptor, correlated with inflammatory markers. Inflammatory markers positively correlated with erythropoietin and negatively correlated with haemoglobin. The soluble transferrin receptor-log ferritin index, specifically values ≥1.5, identified patients likely to experience the greatest haemoglobin responses to i.v. iron.Intravenous iron increases haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations through 3 months following critical illness. Traditional iron assays are influenced by inflammation, impeding utility in iron deficiency detection. The soluble transferrin receptor-log ferritin index measured early in critical illness has potential to identify differential i.v. iron treatment responses.Copyright © 2025 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

41172372,2026-02-02,Dual MAPK/VEGF inhibition for KRAS-mutated brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are rare but potentially devastating cerebrovascular lesions. Activating KRAS mutations are common in sporadic bAVMs, but their clinical implications remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel therapeutic strategy for hemorrhagic bAVMs based on dual inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways using an engineered mouse model with a titratable KRASG12V-GFP transgene.The AAV-BR1-CAG vector was used to deliver a KRASG12V-GFP transgene specifically to cerebral endothelial cells. Mice received 5 × 107 to 5 × 1010 genome copies of the vector, and bAVM formation, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and overall survival were assessed. Mice with established hemorrhagic bAVMs were subsequently treated with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) or RMC-7977 (RAS inhibitor), with or without an anti-mouse VEGF antibody, starting 4 weeks after viral delivery. Overall survival was assessed.Selective overexpression of KRASG12V-GFP in cerebral endothelial cells led to the formation of bAVMs in a dose-dependent manner. Mice that received the highest transgene dose developed significantly more bAVMs, exhibited a higher ICH burden, and had worse overall survival compared with those that received lower transgene doses. In mice receiving the highest transgene dose, trametinib alone modestly improved the median overall survival (8.4 weeks vs 6.4 weeks, p = 0.049), while single-agent RMC-7977 showed no significant benefit. Anti-VEGF therapy alone reduced survival (6.9 weeks vs 9.6 weeks, p = 0.044). However, combination therapy with trametinib or RMC-7977 and anti-VEGF antibody significantly prolonged survival, with the most pronounced benefit seen in the RMC-7977 plus anti-VEGF group (13.1 weeks vs 6.7 weeks in controls, p = 0.024).Our findings suggest that, in addition to promoting bAVM formation, KRAS mutations in cerebral endothelial cells might be causally implicated in bAVM rupture.

41172369,2026-02-02,Herbert Mayo (1796-1852): a pioneering neuroanatomist's forgotten legacy.,"British anatomical physiology in the early 19th century evolved from the work of William Harvey, Thomas Willis, and William Hunter, who emphasized cerebral functional localization, integrating physiology and anatomy. This novel perspective was championed by Herbert Mayo (1796-1852). A student of Charles Bell at the Middlesex Hospital in London, Mayo subsequently became a surgeon there in 1818 and later a professor of anatomy and surgery. His experiments on the motor functions of the seventh cranial nerve and sensorimotor functions of the fifth cranial nerve brought him renown. Mayo, inspired by Johann Christian Reil, also conducted the first accurate brainstem dissections, developed innovative tissue preservation methods, and provided detailed descriptions of key fiber tracts. Mayo's 1822-1823 Anatomical and Physiological Commentaries and 1827 A Series of Engravings Intended to Illustrate the Structure of the Brain and Spinal Chord in Man accurately depicted the corona radiata, cerebellar peduncles, and uncinate fascicle. In his 1842 book, The Nervous System and Its Functions, Mayo discussed the localization of higher brain functions. His dissections remained unmatched until Josef Klingler's work in 1934. Despite the quality of his work, Mayo has been largely neglected, possibly because of his tumultuous relationship with Bell and later professional difficulties. Nevertheless, Mayo significantly contributed to white matter anatomy and led the search for cerebral localization, subsequently impacting neurosurgery.

Labor pain is a significant psychophysiological stressor, and its association with PPD is not completely understood. This study investigated the relationship between the effectiveness of labor epidural analgesia (LEA), measured as percentage improvement in pain (PIP), and the risk of PPD at six weeks postpartum.In this prospective observational cohort study, 156 women were enrolled. Participants self-selected whether to receive LEA. Pain intensity was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale, and PPD symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on postpartum day 3 and at six weeks postpartum.A moderate positive correlation was observed between LEA satisfaction and PIP (rs = 0.389, P < 0.001). A small but significant negative correlation was found between LEA satisfaction and EPDS scores (rs =  - 0.268, P = 0.007). However, PIP was not significantly associated with the risk of PPD. PPD prevalence did not significantly differ between the LEA group (7.9%) and the non-LEA group (12.7%) (P = 0.491).While the use of LEA provided effective pain relief, it was not associated with the risk of PPD.

41453519,2026-02-02,Pediatric asthma management via integration of a remote spirometry device into an EHR-based artificial intelligence-powered clinical decision support system: A feasibility pragmatic clinical trial.,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Suboptimal asthma control is prevalent and causes significant health care costs. Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast data which pose a major challenge for timely and efficient access to relevant information for clinical decision making. To address this challenge, a machine learning and natural language processing models-powered clinical decision support system (CDS) called Asthma-Guidance Prediction System (A-GPS) was developed. A-GPS automatically extracts and synthesizes pertinent patient data from EHRs for asthma management. To further enhance A-GPS, real-time patient data was added from a home spirometry device and mobile app system (AsthmaTuner), that remotely collected patient-reported outcomes for asthma control and lung function and delivered a clinician-prescribed Asthma Action Plan from EHR to patients. The goal of the study was to assess the feasibility and satisfaction of implementation of an integrated A-GPS with AsthmaTuner for remote asthma management within pediatric primary care.Study design was a parallel-group, non-blinded, dual-site, 2-arm pragmatic, randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 22 dyads (one clinician and one pediatric patient) at Mayo Clinic Health System and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The primary endpoint was successful implementation of the integrated A-GPS with AsthmaTuner in primary care and study participants' satisfaction.The technological integration and application of the integrated A-GPS and AsthmaTuner in primary care as a clinical CDS for remote asthma management was feasible. This protocol provides developers with a framework for the best practices for evaluating AI tools and enables digital technology via an RCT.Registered via ClinicalTrials.govNCT06062433 SIGNIFICANCE: We anticipate this study will establish a conceptual and operational framework for implementing AI-powered CDS in pediatric asthma management, with the goal that these methodological advancements will be expanded to the management of adults with asthma and other chronic complex diseases. Reporting a clinical trial protocol for the evaluation of an AI tool and following the reporting guidelines are valuable for establishing best practices evaluating AI tools, specifically for the developers and other key stakeholders who plan to evaluate AI models via RCTs in health care settings.

41343819,2026-02-02,Three-dimensional surface scanning for registration in stereotactic neurosurgery: a cadaveric feasibility study.,"Achieving submillimetric accuracy in stereotactic neurosurgery remains critical for safely targeting deep brain structures. Current workflows rely on intraoperative CT to register stereotactic frames to preoperative imaging, but this introduces additional radiation exposure, cost, and workflow complexity. Three-dimensional surface scanning (3DSS) potentially offers a fast radiation-free alternative capable of capturing detailed craniofacial anatomy and frame geometry. Therefore, the aim of this cadaveric study was to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and navigational compatibility of integrating 3DSS into stereotactic workflows as a potential replacement for intraoperative CT.A human cadaveric head was imaged with both thin-slice CT and structured-light 3DSS after mounting stereotactic frame components. CT, 3DSS, and computer-aided design (CAD) models were registered using a multistep point cloud alignment pipeline involving the fast point feature histogram, the random sample consensus method, and the iterative closest point algorithm. Accuracy was assessed using surface deviation error, root mean square error (RMSE), and fiducial registration error within a commercial neuronavigation platform.Fusion of the 3D facial scan with CT provided a mean surface deviation error of approximately 0.4 mm. Registration of the 3DSS-derived N-bar localizer to its CAD reference model produced a frame alignment RMSE of 1.3 mm. Within the navigation system, the 3DSS-based workflow achieved a mean fiducial registration error of 0.14 mm (range 0.02-0.20 mm), outperforming the conventional CT-based method (mean error 0.20 mm, range 0.09-0.40 mm).The 3DSS-based method enabled precise submillimetric stereotactic registration without the need for intraoperative CT, reducing radiation exposure and operative complexity. This workflow is fully compatible with existing navigation systems and could serve as a practical radiation-free alternative in stereotactic neurosurgery.

In this scenario, cranial nerve (CN) VI is particularly exposed to potential injuries due to its deep-seated location and absence of a bony foramen that serves as a reference of its most distal cisternal point, especially when it is encased or displaced by large lesions. This study aimed to provide reliable operative guidance for preventing injuries to CN VI during the retrosigmoid approach to address CPA and petrotentorial lesions.Four formalin-fixed, latex-injected anatomical specimens were dissected to highlight and investigate the relevant anatomy of the CPA and petroclival region during the retrosigmoid approach. Additionally, 50 sides of noninjected formalin-fixed specimens were dissected for morphometric evaluation. Correlations between the petrotentorial junction (PTJ), porus acusticus (PA), and trigeminal impression (TI) with the entry point of CN VI into Dorello's canal were evaluated. An illustrative clinical case and a 3D anatomical model generated through the photogrammetry scanning technique were described.In the sagittal plane, CN VI entrance into Dorello's canal was found in a trajectory parallel to the PTJ, passing through the inferior aspect of the PA and 21.5 ± 1.3 mm anteriorly. In the coronal plane, the entry point of CN VI into Dorello's canal was estimated at 6.2 ± 1.2 mm from the anterior edge of the TI in a trajectory perpendicular to the PTJ in 47 (81%) specimens.The obtained results demonstrated two surgical strategies to locate Dorello's canal within the retrosigmoid route: 1) approximately 20 mm anterior along the inferior edge of the PA parallel to the PTJ; and 2) approximately 6 mm inferior to the anterior edge of the TI, perpendicular to the PTJ.

41628259,2026-02-03,Defining an Optimal Result of Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Intervention: Results From the Tri-QOL Study.,"Recent randomized trials have demonstrated that for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI) improve patients' symptoms, function, and quality of life and that the amount of health status improvement correlates with the extent of TR reduction. Defining this relationship in greater detail can potentially provide insight into device selection and patient-specific treatment goals. We therefore sought to better understand the relationship between both baseline TR severity and change in TR after TTVI and the extent of improvement in health status after TTVI.As part of the Tri-QOL (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Validation in Tricuspid Valve Disease) study, data from 11 studies of TTVI devices were transferred to the US Food and Drug Administration to harmonize and anonymize before analysis by an independent center. This secondary, observational analysis used patient-level data from the 6 single-arm studies of patients who underwent TTVI to explore the association of change in KCCQ-OS with TR grade using multivariable models, adjusted for age, sex, chronic lung disease, and baseline KCCQ-OS. The primary model included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and the interaction between the two.Among 1056 patients with ≥severe TR who underwent TTVI, mean age was 79.1±7.1 years, 60.3% were female, and mean baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-overall summary score [KCCQ-OS] was 49.5±22.3. Baseline TR grade was severe in 33.5%, massive in 35.9%, and torrential in 30.6%. One-month after TTVI, TR was none/trace in 21.7%, mild in 27.2%, moderate in 28.1%, and ≥evere in 23.1%, while the mean change in KCCQ-OS was 17.0±21.3 points. In a multivariable model that included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and their interaction, there was a strong association between reduction in TR and improvement in KCCQ-OS, with no consistent evidence of a threshold of TR grade below which there was no further improvement in KCCQ-OS. However, among patients with baseline torrential TR, the extent of health status improvement plateaued for patients achieving moderate or less TR at 1 month (ie, a 3-grade improvement from baseline).Health status improvement after TTVI was most strongly associated with the degree of TR reduction, although there was minimal additional improvement for most patients beyond a 3-grade reduction in TR. These findings support the goal of achieving mild or less TR with TTVI, although patients with torrential TR at baseline may be well served if moderate TR can be achieved.",Circulation,"Feb 03, 2026",2026.0,Feb,3.0,Suzanne V Arnold|John A Spertus|Kensey Gosch|Shannon M Dunlay|Danielle M Olds|Philip G Jones|Saibal Kar|Changfu Wu|David J Cohen,Shannon M Dunlay,"University of Missouri-Kansas City's Healthcare Institute for Innovations in Quality and Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (S.V.A., J.A.S., K.G., D.M.O., P.G.J.).|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).|Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand Oaks, CA (S.K.).|US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD (C.W.).|St. Francis Hospital, Roslyn, NY (D.J.C.).|Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, NY (D.J.C.).","Suzanne V Arnold, John A Spertus, Kensey Gosch, Shannon M Dunlay, Danielle M Olds, Philip G Jones, Saibal Kar, Changfu Wu, David J Cohen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41628259/,"Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) often experience poor quality of life, and transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI) can improve their symptoms and function.

41627658,2026-02-03,Bias and Oversight in Clinical AI: A Review of Decision Support Tools and Equity Frameworks.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tools (DSTs) are increasingly used across clinical settings to improve efficiency and support decision-making. However, these tools risk perpetuating existing healthcare disparities if not designed and implemented with transparency, equity, and cultural sensitivity. This review explores how racial and ethnic biases manifest within AI-driven DSTs and evaluates the role of governance frameworks in mitigating such harms. It examines the implications of biased algorithms, presents case examples highlighting disparities in tool performance, and critically assesses the adequacy of current national and international regulatory guidance. The review reports that bias can stem from unrepresentative training datasets, exclusion of equity auditing in design, and the absence of mandated transparency in reporting. Although several frameworks exist to guide development and reporting, few are mandatory, and most do not include equity as a core criterion. The current UK and US regulatory models are decentralized and lack mechanisms to systematically detect or prevent bias. To prevent biased tools from entering practice, equity must be structurally embedded across the AI lifecycle. Embedding equity into AI tools requires standardized subgroup performance reporting, mandating fairness assessments, and establishing national and global governance standards to ensure AI tools serve all populations equitably.© 2026.

41622559,2026-02-03,Present Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potentials and Lack of Auditory Sensation Through a Cochlear Implant After Vestibular Schwannoma Resection.,"Auditory nerve monitoring through electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) can be used to assess cochlear neural integrity during vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection. Herein, we report on 5 cochlear implant (CI) patients who underwent VS resection with present eCAP responses both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Patients either did not perceive any sound through their CI or rapidly adapted to electrical stimulation, suggesting that the presence of eCAP does not guarantee auditory nerve function in patients with VS resection.Five patients who underwent simultaneous VS translabyrinthine resection and cochlear implantation.Simultaneous cochlear implantation and translabyrinthine microsurgical VS resection.Electrically evoked compound action potential.All patients had eCAP responses present during their VS resection and for at least 50 days post-surgery. Three of the 5 patients did not perceive any sound with their cochlear implant. This shows that the presence of an eCAP alone does not guarantee a functional auditory nerve or auditory perception. The other 2 patients could hear non-speech sounds, but these sounds quickly became inaudible, indicating that their auditory nerve lacked the ability to integrate the electrical stimulus over time.The presence of an eCAP response does not guarantee auditory sensation through a CI. Although eCAP measurements provide insight into the function of the distal end of the nerve, it does not ascertain integrity or function of the larger auditory nerve pathway.

41627192,2026-02-03,Discovery of an Artificial Intelligence Label Feedback Loop: How the Success of a Clinically Implemented Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Has Created an Unforeseen Challenge to Algorithm Retraining.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) augmented laboratory tests can improve quality, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and staff satisfaction. However, the clinical success of these tests can introduce unforeseen challenges for model retraining. This study describes the discovery of an ""AI label feedback loop"" in a clinically implemented AI-augmented kidney stone composition test.An AI-augmented kidney stone composition test (V1) has been previously deployed for clinical kidney stone characterization. After several years of clinical use, a retrained model (V2) was developed using 6 times more data. Model performance of both V1 and V2 were evaluated across 3 datasets: a recent production validation (hold-out) set (mostly AI-influenced labels), the original V1 validation set (pre-AI, entirely human-labeled), and a subset of recent cases with exclusively human-generated or human-corrected labels.V2 demonstrated a 10% lower concordance rate than V1 when evaluated on the recent production hold-out set, despite a much larger training dataset. Performance between V1 and V2 was similar when applied to the pre-AI validation set. Notably, V2 outperformed V1 on the recent subset of cases with human-only or human-corrected labels, particularly for less-common stone types. These findings revealed an AI label feedback loop, confounding retraining and evaluation.The integration of AI into clinical practice can potentially influence reported test results, complicating the development and evaluation of future models. To mitigate AI label feedback loops, ongoing human annotation and careful validation set construction are essential. These strategies can ensure reliable performance assessment and support the safe evolution of clinical AI systems.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2026. All rights reserved.

Follow-up was until December 2019. Weighted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to test the association between body fat percentage (BF%) and metabolic disorders (ie, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension) and mortality. Models were adjusted for potential confounders while considering complex survey design and were further stratified by sex and BF% as tertiles in normal-weight individuals.Included in this study sample were 20,613 individuals of whom 6424 were normal weight by BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) (45.7% men, 69.6% non-Hispanic Whites).

The effectiveness of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for managing cardiogenic shock in TTS remains unknown.We assessed outcomes in TTS patients with cardiogenic shock who received MCS compared to medical therapy only by using data from the International Takotsubo Registry. Two independent propensity scores were computed to investigate outcomes of patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) vs. medical therapy only (1:2 propensity score matched cohort) and patients with an Impella vs. medical therapy only (1:1 propensity score matched cohort). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcomes included MCS-related complications.Among 3740 eligible patients, 309 (8.3%) patients had cardiogenic shock, of whom 112 (36.2%) had MCS and 197 (63.8%) had medical therapy only. After propensity-score matching, the use of an IABP was found to be associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate than medical therapy only (14.5% vs. 35.5%, P = 0.002), while mortality rates in the Impella group and medical therapy only group were comparable (25.0% vs. 29.2%, P = 0.75). MCS-related complications occurred in 6.0% of the IABP cohort and in 31.3% of Impella cohort.Active MCS has been increasingly used for the management of cardiogenic shock in patients with TTS. This observational study could not demonstrate an association with improved mortality with an Impella device, but possibly with an IABP when compared to patients with medical management only. MCS-related complications occurred more frequently in the Impella cohort than in the IABP cohort. Further data are required to confirm results of the present study.© 2026.

Data were analyzed from November 2023 to February 2024.Laboratory-confirmed identification of any E coli organism isolated from a normally sterile body site obtained from a resident of the surveillance area.Outcomes of interest were population-based and site-specific incidence rate estimates of E coli infections, demographic and clinical characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and predicted O serotypes by in silico serotyping.Among 1345 cases of E coli infection in 1334 unique case-patients, the median (IQR) age was 68 (55-79) years, and 762 case-patients (57.1%) were female; 1223 infections (90.9%) were from blood and 122 infections (9.1%) were from other sterile sites. The overall estimated annual incidence rate was 74.7 per 100 000 population (surveillance site range, 51.4-96.0 per 100 000 population). Estimated incidence rates were higher among cases in patients aged 60 years or older compared with younger patients (225.0 vs 30.6 per 100 000 population), although rates were similar for females and males aged 60 years or older (224.5 vs 224.0 per 100 000 population). The most common underlying medical condition reported was diabetes (457 patients [34.0%]). Pyelonephritis (267 infections [19.9%]) and lower urinary tract infections (495 infections [36.8%]) were the most frequently associated infection types. In total, 1279 cases (95.1%) were hospitalized for less than 30 days after isolate collection; 106 case-patients (7.9%) died. Overall, 185 infections (13.8%) were due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E coli; 275 of 1061 isolates (25.9%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 370 of 1286 (28.8%) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

41627886,2026-02-03,Age and sex influence transcriptomic responses to statin therapy that control liver aging during systemic metabolic dysfunction.,"Older age increases susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) but whether it impacts response to therapies, and how the therapies impact regulators of biological aging, are poorly understood. Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway to block cholesterol biosynthesis and are widely used in MASLD patients to reduce cardiovascular disease. Whether statins prevent progression to cirrhosis is under investigation. However, the molecular effects of statins in human liver, particularly in the context of aging, remain poorly defined.We analyzed liver transcriptomes and matched clinical data from 368 adults enrolled in the Duke MASLD Biorepository with a focus on age-dependent responses and the interplay between senescence and ferroptosis, a regulated death process that is constrained by the mevalonate pathway. Serum ALT, AST, and LDL cholesterol levels were lower in statin users of both sexes, particularly among older individuals. Transcriptome analyses revealed that statin use strongly associated with suppression of senescence-related pathways. Statin use also associated with increased activation of pathways linked to ferroptosis. Both responses persisted after propensity score matching to control for clinical confounders and were validated in an independent obese cohort.Age-dependent transcriptional remodeling in the liver differs in statin users and non-users. Pathways involved in senescence are suppressed while those that promote ferroptosis are induced in statin users. These results suggest that statins may suppress biological aging in MASLD by acting as senolytics and highlight the complex, context-specific roles of senescence in liver adaptation and remodeling.Copyright © 2026 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Feb 02, 2026",2026.0,Feb,2.0,David S Umbaugh|Liuyang Wang|Kuo Du|Rajesh K Dutta|Seh H Oh|Georgia S Karachaliou|Manal F Abdelmalek|Ayako Suzuki|Anna M Diehl,Manal F Abdelmalek,"Departments of Medicine.|Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.|Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","David S Umbaugh, Liuyang Wang, Kuo Du, Rajesh K Dutta, Seh H Oh, Georgia S Karachaliou, Manal F Abdelmalek, Ayako Suzuki, Anna M Diehl",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41627886/,"This research paper explores how age and sex influence the effects of statin therapy on liver aging in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

41627892,2026-02-03,Uncovering the genetic landscape of cholangiocarcinoma and its subtypes via GWAS and integrative analyses.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare but aggressive malignancy with poorly understood genetic susceptibility. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigating germline variants associated with CCA risk remain limited. We aimed to identify genetic risk loci for CCA and its clinical subtypes through comprehensive GWAS and post-GWAS analyses.We conducted a GWAS of 2,366 CCA cases and 11,750 controls of European ancestry. Genome-wide significant loci (P<5×10-8) were identified and further examined through fine-mapping, functional annotation, and HLA imputation. Subgroup analyses were conducted by CCA subtypes and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) status. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were employed to investigate the shared genetic architecture and potential causal relationships with a diverse range of traits. We identified one new genome-wide significant variant, rs535777 (OR=1.44), near HLA-DRB1/DQA1 associated with CCA, and two variants associated with extrahepatic CCA: rs116224263 (OR=0.17) in LINC02506 at 4p15.1 and rs6914950 (OR=1.63) near HLA-DRB1/DQB1. Stratified analyses revealed rs2395184 (OR=3.51) near HLA-DRA/DRB5 associated with PSC-related CCA, and rs142674434 (OR=2.98) in THSD7A at 7p21.3 associated with non-PSC-related CCA. HLA imputation uncovered new amino acid residues associated with disease risk. Cross-trait analyses identified shared genetic signals between CCA and anthropometric, lipidemic, lifestyle, and medical traits. Mendelian randomization supported putative causal associations for twelve traits with CCA or its subtypes.Our large-scale GWAS highlights new genetic variants and HLA-linked mechanisms underlying CCA susceptibility. Integrating multi-step post-GWAS approaches enhances understanding of CCA pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of risk biomarkers for early detection and precision prevention strategies.Copyright © 2026 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Feb 02, 2026",2026.0,Feb,2.0,Younghun Han|Jinyoung Byun|Caitlin J VanLith|Matthew A Cooley|Vikram R Shaw|Rikita I Hatia|Fowsiyo Y Ahmed|Nasra H Giama|Hawa M Ali|Nellie A Campbell|Mohamed Hassan|Jesper B Andersen|Victor Ankoma-Sey|Jesus M Banales|Luis Bujanda|Oliver F Bathe|Tanios S Bekaii-Saab|Mitesh J Borad|Niklas K Björkström|Carlos HF Chan|Sean P Cleary|Martin Cornillet|Trine Folseraas|Peter R Galle|Jeanine M Genkinger|Robert J MacInnis|Gregory J Gores|Lipika Goyal|Richard S Houlston|Sumera I Ilyas|Milind Javle|Julia S Johansen|Troels D Christensen|Ashwin S Kamath|Robin K Kelley|Shahid A Khan|Richard D Kim|Sandi A Kwee|Angela Lamarca|Frank Lammert|Nicholas F LaRusso|Stacie Lindsey|Rocio IR Macias|Harmeet Malhi|Tushar C Patel|Jennifer B Permuth|Helen L Reeves|Stephen Rossi|William Sanchez|Rory L Smoot|Anthony J Swerdlow|Hop S Tran Cao|Juan W Valle|Arndt Weinmann|Julia Weinmann-Menke|Linda L Wong|Xuehong Zhang|Vincent Zimmer|Andrew X Zhu|Konstantinos N Lazaridis|Brian D Juran|Prasun Jalal|Jennifer J Knox|Amy Hutchinson|Belynda Hicks|Jill E Koshiol|Stephen J Chanock|Manal M Hassan|Christopher I Amos|Katherine A McGlynn|Lewis R Roberts,Caitlin J VanLith|Matthew A Cooley|Fowsiyo Y Ahmed|Nasra H Giama|Hawa M Ali|Nellie A Campbell|Mohamed Hassan|Tanios S Bekaii-Saab|Mitesh J Borad|Gregory J Gores|Sumera I Ilyas|Nicholas F LaRusso|Harmeet Malhi|Tushar C Patel|William Sanchez|Rory L Smoot|Konstantinos N Lazaridis|Brian D Juran|Lewis R Roberts,"University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.|Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.|Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Mayo Clinic Graduate Program in Clinical and Translational Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.|Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Department of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.|Liver Associates of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.|Department of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases, Biogipuzkoa Health Research Institute, Donostia University Hospital, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), CIBERehd, Ikerbasque, San Sebastian, Spain.|Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, School of Sciences, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.|Departments of Surgery and Oncology, University of Calgary; Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.|Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.|University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.|Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.|Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.|University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.|Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.|Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.|Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, East Melbourne, VIC 3002, Australia.|Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3053, Australia.|Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.|Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.|Department of GI Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.|Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital - Herlev and Gentofte, Denmark.|Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.|Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College, London, UK.|Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, H.

41627953,2026-02-03,Characterizing early behavioral and social-emotional problems in young children with SCN1A+ Dravet syndrome: Findings from the ENVISION prospective natural history study.,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is the prototypic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by drug-resistant seizures, developmental slowing, and many other morbidities. Detailed characterization of behavioral phenotypes and social-emotional skill development are limited.We prospectively assessed behavioral and social-emotional problems in the ENVISION natural history study (NCT04537832) of children with DS associated with SCN1A pathogenic variants (SCN1A+ DS) enrolled at <5 years of age. Assessments every 3 months for up to 2 years included the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd Edition (VABS-3).Fifty-eight children with DS enrolled at 16 sites worldwide. Problematic behaviors-inattention, aggressive or oppositional behaviors, and withdrawn and autistic behaviors-began before age 3 years, became more evident with age, and were clinically significant in many children by age 3-4 years. CBCL Total, Externalizing, and Internalizing Problems T-scores rose by approximately 3 points per year, and BITSEA Problem scale scores increased by 2.3 points annually (p = .002). SDQ Hyperactivity scores worsened over time (p = .013), whereas emotional difficulties remained stable. VABS-3 Socialization domain scores, which were already more than 1 SD below the normative mean at baseline, decreased further, particularly in younger participants. Correlation analyses showed that poorer communication abilities were associated with increased problematic behaviors (R = -.55 for CBCL Total Problems and VABS-3 Communication scores). Mixed-effects modeling identified age as the strongest predictor of worsening behavioral outcomes.We found that behavioral and social-emotional problems are inherent components of DS that present in toddlerhood and worsen throughout early childhood. This highlights the need to diagnose and manage these issues early. Targeted therapy may alleviate the wide-ranging morbidities that are intrinsic to DS, including the social-emotional and behavior problems that frequently emerge.© 2026 Encoded Therapeutics.

41628362,2026-02-03,Molecular classification of radiation-induced meningiomas.,"Radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs) are an uncommon late complication of cranial irradiation that frequently display aggressive behavior. Although recent genomic and epigenomic studies have redefined sporadic meningiomas into four molecular groups with distinct biological and clinical characteristics, the same analysis has not yet been conducted on RIMs. This study sought to contextualize RIMs within the current methylation-based meningioma classification.DNA methylation data from RIMs (n = 20) were integrated with a reference cohort of sporadic (n = 121) meningiomas previously used to define molecular subgroups. Molecular group membership was assigned using a supervised machine-learning approach. Copy-number alterations and pathway enrichment analyses were derived from methylation data, and clinical features were compared between RIMs and sporadic meningiomas.Supervised molecular classification assigned 70% RIMs to the hypermetabolic subtype. The RIM cohort demonstrated broad DNA hypomethylation enriched for metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. Copy-number profiling revealed widespread chromosomal instability, including recurrent 22q loss involving NF2 and SMARCB1 as well as PTEN, MYB, and C19MC, consistent with the copy number alterations observed in hypermetabolic meningiomas.RIMs predominantly align with the hypermetabolic molecular group, characterized by metabolic pathway activation and genomic instability.

41629127,2026-02-03,Sex and anticitrullinated protein antibodies modify the relationship between inflammation and cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Female sex and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are associated with higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since disease-related inflammation is linked to cardiovascular risk, we explored whether sex and ACPA influenced the association between disease activity at study entry and cardiovascular risk in established RA.We evaluated 4008 patients with prevalent RA from an international observational cohort enrolled between 1985 and 2012. Outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) and ischaemic cardiovascular events (iCVE: MACE, angina, revascularisation, transient ischaemic attack and peripheral arterial disease). Follow-up accrued from enrolment until the first event or censoring. Multivariable Cox models stratified by centre risk evaluated disease activity, sex, ACPA and their interactions.We documented 193 MACE and 299 iCVE. Disease activity and sex were associated with MACE (all p≤0.017) and iCVE (p≤0.005) but ACPA was only associated with MACE (p=0.043). A three-way interaction on MACE (p=0.034) but not iCVE was noted. Among ACPA-negative patients, disease activity was associated with MACE in males (HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.16)) but not females (p-for-interaction=0.022). Among ACPA-positive patients, neither the disease activity x sex interaction (p=0.929), nor main effect of disease activity on MACE (p=0.124) was significant, but male sex was (HR 1.61 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.27)). Among females, neither disease activity x ACPA interaction (p=0.523) nor disease activity (p=0.319) was significant for MACE, but ACPA was (HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.42)).The effect of disease activity at enrolment on cardiovascular risk in prevalent RA varies across patient groups with different sex and ACPA characteristics.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

41629669,2026-02-03,Systematic Review: Agentic AI in Neuroradiology: Technical Promise with Limited Clinical Evidence.,"Agentic artificial intelligence systems featuring iterative reasoning, autonomous tool use, or multi-agent collaboration have been proposed as solutions to the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in neuroradiology. However, the extent of their implementation and clinical validation remains unclear. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (January 2022-August 2025) for studies implementing agentic AI in neuroradiology. Six independent reviewers (three medical doctors and three AI specialists) assessed full texts. Agentic AI was defined as requiring mandatory iterative reasoning plus either autonomous tool use or multi-agent collaboration. Study quality was evaluated using adapted QUADAS-AI criteria. From 230 records, 9 studies (3.90%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, five (55.60%) implemented true multi-agent architecture, two (22.20%) used hybrid or conceptual frameworks, and two (22.20%) relied on single-model LLMs without genuine agentic behavior. All nine studies were single center with no external validation. Sample sizes were small (median 142 cases; range 16-302). The only randomized controlled trial-INSPIRE (neurophysiology with imaging correlation)-demonstrated high technical performance (≈92% accuracy; AIGERS 0.94 for AI-assisted vs. 0.70 for AI-only, p < 0.001) but showed no measurable clinical benefit when physicians used AI assistance compared with independent reporting. Safety assessments were absent from all studies. Agentic AI in neuroradiology remains technically promising but clinically unproven. Severe evidence scarcity (3.90% inclusion rate), frequent overextension of the ""agentic"" label (30% of studies lacked genuine autonomy), and the persistent gap between technical performance and clinical utility indicate that the field remains in its early research phase.

41183146,2026-02-03,Targeting the ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 Axis Overcomes Genotoxic Therapy Resistance in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal malignancies, primarily due to its robust resistance to genotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance is essential to improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we identified trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), previously known for its role in RNA modification, as a critical mediator of homologous recombination (HR) repair that specifically contributes to resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. TGS1 was significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues, correlating strongly with advanced disease stages, therapy resistance, and poor patient prognosis. Following DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylated TGS1 at serine residues S389 and S531, which mediated its direct interaction with BRCA1 and subsequent recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction enhanced HR repair efficiency, enabling cancer cells to survive genotoxic stress. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TGS1 induced HR deficiency and markedly enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, particularly PARP inhibitors, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro and in both cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover an ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 signaling axis that promotes DNA repair and resistance to genotoxic therapies in pancreatic cancer, positioning TGS1 as a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to enhance treatment efficacy.The ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 signaling axis is a critical regulator of DNA repair that can be targeted to overcome genotoxic therapy resistance, providing a promising therapeutic strategy that could transform pancreatic cancer treatment.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Cancer research,"Feb 02, 2026",2026.0,Feb,2.0,Changying Li|Xuran Zhao|Xinyan Li|Chunyan Wang|Zhenyu Huo|Xin Xu|Wenjuan Kang|Somaira Nowsheen|Khaled Aziz|Guangyi Sun|Zhihua Liu|Zhenkun Lou|Min Deng,Zhenkun Lou,"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.|Department of Dermatology, The Iowa Clinic, Waukee, Iowa.|Department of Radiation Oncology and Molecular Radiation Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.|State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Changying Li, Xuran Zhao, Xinyan Li, Chunyan Wang, Zhenyu Huo, Xin Xu, Wenjuan Kang, Somaira Nowsheen, Khaled Aziz, Guangyi Sun, Zhihua Liu, Zhenkun Lou, Min Deng",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183146/,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal cancer due to its resistance to standard therapies.

41376548,2026-02-04,Evaluating the Statistical Robustness of Randomized Controlled Trials of Spinal Cord Stimulation for Pain through the Use of Fragility Index.,"The use of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for managing severe refractory chronic pain has expanded considerably due to positive statistical evidence regarding its use; however, the statistical robustness of the underlying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) requires further scrutiny. One such tool that can be used for this purpose is the fragility index, which quantifies how many individual outcome events must be altered for an outcome to lose statistical significance. Thus the index can be used quantitatively to assess the stability and robustness of an RCT's conclusions, with higher values indicating increased trial stability. This study assesses the fragility of pain outcomes across RCTs investigating SCS for chronic pain to better understand the quality and robustness of evidence.A systematic search was conducted for RCTs assessing SCS for any chronic pain indication. The primary outcome was an evaluation of the trial-specific fragility index for the prespecified pain primary outcomes of RCTs. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of fragility for (1) specified indications for SCS therapy, (2) reported pain outcomes appearing in three or more RCTs, (3) the presence/absence of a conflict of interest, and (4) comparisons of SCS to conservative management or different SCS waveform modalities.A total of 30 RCTs were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) fragility index across the primary outcome of all trials was 5.45 (3.00 to 11.45).

This narrative review synthesizes contemporary evidence and technical advances across multiple venous applications, including transvenous embolization for AVMs and dural fistulas, treatment of CSF-venous fistulas, and venous sinus stent placement for pulsatile tinnitus, intracranial hypertension, and skull base leaks. Recent data underscore high efficacy rates and favorable safety profiles in carefully selected patients, often matching or surpassing traditional arterial approaches. Innovations such as fetal vein of Galen embolization, vein-targeted brain-computer interface implantation, and endovascular CSF shunting exemplify the therapeutic versatility of venous access. However, procedural challenges, such as venous anatomy, access, and embolic control, require meticulous planning and advanced skill sets. Trials like TATAM and DIVE-IIN are and will shape evidence-based indications for transvenous therapy.

40835421,2026-02-04,Maximizing the Conspicuity of CSF-Venous Fistulas on CT Myelography: Assessment of Contrast Density and Timing Effects.,"Advancements in CT myelography (CTM) have improved visualization of CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs), a frequent cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). However, the relative impact of the timing of image acquisition and the contrast density in the subarachnoid space remain unclear. This study compared the effects of timing and contrast density in the ipsilateral subarachnoid space and assessed the impact of other technical factors on CVF conspicuity using a validated instrument to stratify diagnostic confidence.A retrospective review of International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition-confirmed patients with SIH with CVFs was performed. Only fistulas classified as definite by the Duke CSF-Venous Fistula Confidence Score (DCCS) were included. All available CTMs covering each index fistula site were reviewed, excluding examinations occurring after surgery or embolization for a definite CVF. We assigned a DCCS to each acquisition and recorded contrast density in the subarachnoid space ipsilateral to the known CVF and image acquisition time. Patient positioning and scanner type were also collected as potential confounders. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess associations with CVF conspicuity.One hundred forty-four patients with 149 definite CVFs comprised the final cohort, from which 222 CTMs and 697 acquisitions were assessed. Both increased contrast density and reduced acquisition time were associated with increased CVF conspicuity in univariate analyses (P < .001). When adjusting for sex, scanner type, and patient positioning in the multivariate model, contrast density and time remained significant predictors of conspicuity (P < .001). Density had a 4-fold greater impact on conspicuity than time, with a 14.3% increase in likelihood of CVF detection per 100 Hounsfield unit (HU) increase in attenuation and an optimal target threshold at 836 HU.Both contrast density and time influence conspicuity of CVFs on CTM; however, the greater relative impact of density suggests that myelogram technique should prioritize maximization of contrast density for optimal visualization of CVFs. Positioning strategies to increase local contrast pooling may improve CVF detection more effectively than timing adjustments alone.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40876944,2026-02-04,Improved Conspicuity of CSF-Venous Fistulas with Saline Pressure Augmentation: A Multi-Institutional Case Series.,"CSF-venous fistulas are a common and increasingly recognized cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Most CSF-venous fistulas occur in the thoracic spine and usually arise from nerve root sleeve diverticula. Myelography in the lateral decubitus position is necessary to detect and localize these fistulas, because this technique maximizes contrast density within diverticula, thereby permitting visualization of draining veins. Many modifications to decubitus myelography have been employed in an attempt to improve the conspicuity of CSF-venous fistulas. In theory, maximizing the subarachnoid-venous pressure gradient during imaging should increase contrast flow through CSF-venous fistulas, improving detection of these sometimes-subtle leaks. Augmentation of intrathecal pressure through saline injection before myelography is a simple technique to achieve this and is common in many practices. However, only one prior case report has demonstrated the impact of pressurization on the visualization of a CSF-venous fistula. In this multi-institutional, retrospective case series, we report on a larger cohort of patients in whom CSF-venous fistulas were either occult or nondefinite on myelography without saline pressurization and subsequently definitely seen on myelography with saline pressurization. While our study design precludes determining the incremental yield of saline infusion, it nonetheless provides further support for the value of saline pressurization during myelography in patients with suspected CSF-venous fistulas.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

We examined the association between broadband internet availability, individual digital literacy factors, and VTV utilization among patients with cancer. In a retrospective cohort of 13,897 patients across a multi-site practice, VTV utilization was significantly lower in areas with ≤1 internet service provider (ISP) offering download speeds ≥25 Mbps (p = 0.0009). Validation in a regional cohort (n = 6665) confirmed lower VTV utilization in low-broadband areas. Among 1134 surveyed patients, higher digital literacy was the strongest predictor of VTV use (OR 2.5; p < 0.001), even where broadband was limited. This study demonstrates that while both broadband availability and digital literacy independently influence VTV utilization, individual digital skills can partially offset structural limitations, underscoring the need for concurrent investment in broadband infrastructure and targeted digital literacy initiatives to advance access to care.© 2026.

Comprehending the mechanisms and key regulators of cancer-immune crosstalk in the TME is imperative for developing efficacious immunotherapy. Through a series of in vivo CRISPR screens, we identified tumor-intrinsic ITGB1 as a critical regulator of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) development and deciphered its underlying mechanisms. Tumoral ITGB1 facilitated the establishment of pro-tumorigenic TME by orchestrating tumor-associated myeloid populations. Suppressing ITGB1 favored the enrichment of anti-tumorigenic myeloid cells and enhanced infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells, culminating in superior antitumor effects. CRISPR scanning pinpointed a previously unrecognized functional domain essential for ITGB1's pro-tumorigenic activity. This domain is distinct from all known ligand-binding sites in ITGB1. An antibody capable of sterically blocking this domain significantly impaired TNBC progression. These findings position tumoral ITGB1 as a promising therapeutic target for reprogramming the TME from a pro- to an anti-tumorigenic state, thereby effectively inhibiting TNBC development. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism of TNBC development and provides a unique therapeutic strategy for targeting ITGB1 in TNBC treatment.© 2026 The Author(s).

EVs were tagged with antibody-lanthanide (Ln) tags specific to marker proteins and dispersed on a surface, enabling NP-SIMS to produce millions of individual EV mass spectra. Previously, EVs were manually classified based on Ln-tag signals, and as a result, only 5% could be confidently classified as either from cancer or normal cells. Using a random forest model, optimizing data preprocessing, and expanding the spectral features resulted in a 60-fold increase in classification efficiency over manual analysis. We also performed untargeted RF classification, where both supervised and untargeted RF analyses resulted in consistent outcomes, showing the compatibility of RF with the NP-SIMS data for individual EV classification. The results from the untargeted analysis suggest that NP-SIMS with RF could aid in marker discovery in systems where limited sample quantities are available.

41634903,2026-02-05,Advances in the Management of Pediatric Heart Failure: From Medical Therapy to Mechanical Support and Transplantation.,"Pediatric heart failure is a heterogeneous, high-risk clinical syndrome that differs fundamentally from adult heart failure in its etiologies, pathophysiology, and therapeutic responses. Although its absolute prevalence is lower, children experience disproportionate morbidity and mortality, with up to 40% of patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy progressing to death or transplantation within 2 years of diagnosis. Congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and genetic or metabolic disorders dominate the etiologic spectrum, while developmental differences in myocardial signaling, neurohormonal activation, and ventricular remodeling limit direct extrapolation of adult guideline-directed medical therapy. Evidence supporting pharmacologic treatment remains limited, and most therapies are symptom-modifying rather than outcome-modifying, particularly in single-ventricle physiology.

However, catheter misplacement occurs in approximately 25% of cases, potentially resulting in neurological injury or the need for repositioning, highlighting the need for safer and more accurate placement techniques. This review aims to (1) summarize technological innovations developed to enhance the accuracy and safety of bedside EVD placement, (2) evaluate their reported benefits and limitations, and (3) identify key barriers to their clinical implementation in critical care settings.We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus combining terms related to EVD placement and assistive technologies. All the studies evaluated EVD placement using simulations, phantoms, cadavers, and patient procedures conducted at the bedside and in the operating room.We identified 3898 records, and 76 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 30 studies compared stereotactic systems, ultrasound guidance, frameless neuronavigation, and augmented or mixed reality technologies to the freehand technique. These studies consistently reported improved accuracy with advanced systems although complication rates and procedural times were variably reported. An additional 35 and 12 studies evaluated nonimmersive and immersive technologies, respectively, in noncomparative settings. Most of these demonstrated high first-pass success and mean tip deviations under 3 mm. Variability in the definitions of accuracy and procedural metrics limited data synthesis, but the overall findings suggest a promising trajectory for technology-assisted EVD placement.Assistive technologies for EVD placement show potential to improve accuracy and safety over the freehand technique. These early successes signal potential to improve bedside neurosurgical care.

41636590,2026-02-05,Palopegteriparatide for Adults with Chronic Hypoparathyroidism: Skeletal Dynamics Through 3 yr of the Phase 2 paTH Forward Trial.,"Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine to regulate calcium and phosphate balance. In clinical trials, palopegteriparatide (TransCon PTH) treatment enabled independence from conventional therapy (no active vitamin D, ≤500 mg/d calcium) and maintained serum biochemistries within normal ranges. The current analyses describe patterns of change in bone mineral density (BMD), serum bone turnover markers, and serum and urine calcium in adults with chronic hypoparathyroidism treated with palopegteriparatide through 3 yr of the PaTH Forward trial. Baseline BMD Z-scores for the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and 1/3 distal radius were above zero, indicating bone mass exceeding age-adjusted normative values. BMD decreased from these elevated baseline levels with palopegteriparatide treatment, with larger reductions during the first 26 wk and modest declines thereafter. Mean BMD Z-scores at week 162 remained above zero for all 4 sites. Participants with lower baseline BMD (Z-scores below -1 and T-scores below -2.5) generally exhibited lesser declines in BMD versus those with higher baseline BMD. Palopegteriparatide treatment was associated with early increases in bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, CTx) and bone formation (serum procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, P1NP) that peaked at weeks 12 and 26, respectively, followed by declines to levels moderately higher than baseline at week 162. Mean CTx and P1NP in the overall population and the subgroup of postmenopausal women were below their upper limits of normal from weeks 58-162. At week 162, mean serum and median urine calcium remained within normal ranges and 91% of participants were independent from conventional therapy.

41639245,2026-02-05,A split biotin ligase approach reveals proteins associated with oligomeric alpha-synuclein during aggregation.,"Lewy pathology can form over decades in patients with Lewy body diseases, but the causal cellular mechanisms associated with this process remain unclear. This project aims to discover proteins that associate with monomeric and/or oligomeric alpha-synuclein during early stages of the aggregation process. To mimic aggregation processes, cells expressing a synuclein-biotin ligase fusion protein were treated with human recombinant pre-formed fibrils and subjected to BioSITe and mass spectrometry. Using a novel split biotin ligase fused to alpha-synuclein facilitated the identification of proteins specifically associated with multimeric alpha-synuclein. A total of 581 proteins were differentiated into potential interactors of monomeric versus multimeric alpha-synuclein in physiological versus aggregated conditions. The data reveal potentially relevant phosphorylation mechanisms, connections to insulin processing, and a potential interaction with ALS/FTD-associated FUS. Interestingly, we propose that loss of specific interactions may contribute to pathology in patients with sporadic onset of Lewy body diseases. Future studies will validate both true interaction of highlighted proteins with alpha-synuclein, and the impact of such proteins on alpha-synuclein aggregation.© 2026.

41636692,2026-02-05,Exploring Faculty Self-Assessment on Clinician Educator Milestones: Insights From a Multi-Institutional Study.,"Clinician educators are essential to the academic medicine workforce, yet understanding how they assess their own teaching competencies is limited. The Clinical Educator Milestones (CEMs) guide growth across key educator domains, but their use and perceived relevance remain underexplored. This study aims to (1) evaluate clinician educators' self-reported performance on the CEMs; (2) examine differences by career level, specialty, and experience; and (3) inform faculty development efforts through a clearer understanding of educators' perceived strengths and gaps.Clinician educators from 9 US academic institutions completed a self-assessment rating their performance across 4 universal pillars and 11 educational theory and practice competencies on a 1- (novice) to 5- (expert) point scale in 0.5-point increments from August to November 2024. Descriptive statistics and mean difference tests were used to analyze variation across demographic and professional characteristics.A total of 484 responses to at least 1 CEM were received. Respondents rated themselves highest in commitment to professional responsibilities (mean [SD], 4.30 [0.68]), teaching and facilitating learning (mean [SD], 3.96 [0.74]), and professionalism (mean [SD], 3.93 [0.73]) and lowest in medical education scholarship (mean [SD], 3.11 [1.15]), program evaluation (mean [SD], 3.33 [1.03]), and the science of learning (mean [SD], 3.43 [1.10]). Statistically significant group differences were found by years of posttraining clinical experience (F2,413 = 16.87, P < .001, η2 = .076), years of teaching experience (F2,433 = 20.87, P < .001, η2 = .088), and academic rank (F2,403 = 13.96, P < .001, η2 = .065).This study identifies key trends in self-perceived strengths and needs among clinician educators and highlights the limited awareness of the CEM framework. As institutions aim to build effective educator development systems, the CEMs can serve as a useful structure for tailoring support to individuals and identifying institutional needs.© The Author(s) 2026.

41637137,2026-02-05,Artificial Intelligence-Electrocardiography to Predict Incident Atrial Fibrillation and Clinical Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Incident atrial fibrillation (AF) is common following kidney transplantation (KTx) and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Artificial intelligence electrocardiography (AI-ECG) algorithms have demonstrated efficacy in predicting risk of new-onset AF in the general population, however their prognostic value in KTx recipients is relatively unknown.Retrospective analysis was conducted on KTx recipients without AF, with at least one pre-transplant ECG between 2011 and 2021 across three tertiary centers in the United States (Mayo Clinic sites in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida). A previously validated AI-ECG algorithm estimated the probability of incident AF for each patient. Based on AI-ECG probabilities, patients were categorized into high and low risk groups, with the optimal AI-ECG score cut-off determined. The incidence of new-onset AF, allograft failure, and mortality were compared between groups.Overall, 6246 patients (age 53.5 ± 13.8 years; 58.9% male) were included. Pre-transplant AI-ECG probability of AF ≥5% was the optimal cutoff for high risk of incident AF (sensitivity 72%, specificity 62%). High risk scores were associated with true new-onset AF at 30 days (aHR 2.89, 95%CI 2.05-4.09, p<0.001), three years (aHR 2.54, 95%CI 1.99-3.26, p<0.001), and five years post-transplant (aHR 2.48, 95%CI 1.99-3.09, p<0.001). High risk AI-ECG scores were also associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.56, 95%CI 1.30-1.88, p<0.001) and overall allograft failure (aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.30-1.75, p<0.001) through five year follow-up.This pre-transplant AI-ECG parameter identified patients at increased risk of new-onset AF post-KTx and provided prognostic utility. Overall, this easy to obtain tool allows for risk stratification of patients who may benefit from closer monitoring, targeted risk factor modification, and early intervention.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

41637278,2026-02-05,Diabetes mellitus is associated with earlier detection of posterior uveal melanoma.,"PurposeTo explore the relationship between systemic comorbidities and presenting tumor T category in patients with uveal melanoma.MethodsSingle-center, retrospective cohort study of patients with posterior uveal melanoma initially diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2016. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to identify comorbidities associated with presenting tumor T category, as classified by AJCC criteria.ResultsInitial presenting AJCC T category was T1 in 190 (43%), T2 in 130 (29%), T3 in 89 (20%), and T4 in 38 (9%). The most common comorbidities present were hypertension (250 patients, 56%), hyperlipidemia (211, 47%), obesity (137, 31%), and diabetes mellitus (87, 19%). Of these, obesity (p = 0.034), hypertension (p = 0.017), and diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001) were associated with earlier presenting T category on univariate ordinal logistic regression. After multivariate regression, only diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01) and obesity (p = 0.04) remained significantly associated with earlier T category on initial presentation.ConclusionAmong patients presenting with uveal melanoma, diabetes mellitus and obesity were associated with earlier presenting T category, which could reflect earlier detection of uveal melanoma in patients undergoing annual diabetic retinopathy screening examinations or having more frequent contact with the healthcare system.

Despite its growing burden, long-term data on clinical characteristics, management trends, and outcomes remain limited.We conducted a 26-year multicenter retrospective cohort study of adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with NVO at Mayo Clinic sites between 1999-2024. Demographic, microbiologic, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed across five time periods. Predictors of treatment failure were assessed using a multivariable competing risk model.Among 1,255 patients (median age 67; 66% male), lumbosacral involvement was most common (65%), and 21% had multilevel involvement. Pathogens were identified in 77%, most commonly S. aureus (49%; MSSA 37%, MRSA 13%). Over time from 1999-2004 to 2020-2024, Gram-negative bacilli increased from 6% to 14% (p=0.048).Comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (10% to 21%), active chemotherapy (6% to 11%), and immunosuppression (8% to 17%) increased significantly. Additionally, 1-year treatment failure declined (16% to 10%). In multivariable analysis, diabetes mellitus (sHR 1.92, 95% CI 1.18-3.13) and multilevel involvement (sHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.17-2.38) were associated with increased incidence of treatment failure, while concurrent infections (sHR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37-0.87) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (sHR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.90) were associated with lower failure.This large multicenter cohort highlights increasing host complexity, shifting microbiology, and predictors of failure, emphasizing the importance of early risk stratification and tailored strategies, such as multidisciplinary evaluation and close follow-up of high-risk patients to improve outcomes.© The Author(s) 2026.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant, a CGRP antagonist, on abdominal pain, rectal compliance and sensation, gut transit, and safety in participants with non-constipation IBS with pain. We conducted a pilot, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel-group design trial (NCT06221111) of oral rimegepant 75 mg every other day (as approved for migraine prophylaxis) in adults with non-constipation IBS-pain. The trial consisted of 3 periods: 2-week run-in, 4-week treatment, and 4-week post-treatment with diary recording of daily abdominal pain (primary endpoint) and bowel movements (BM). Rectal compliance and sensation were measured using barostat distensions and gastrointestinal and colonic transit by scintigraphy. Statistical analysis compared rimegepant to placebo using ANCOVA with sex, level of anxiety, and baseline measurements as covariates. Twenty-four participants were randomized to rimegepant (n=12) or placebo (n=12); baseline demographics, rectal sensation and compliance were similar between the groups. Rimegepant did not significantly reduce abdominal pain, daily BM frequency, or BM consistency relative to baseline. Compared to placebo, rimegepant significantly reduced sensations of gas, urgency, pain during 24mmHg, and gas and urgency sensations during 36mmHg rectal distension (all P <0.05 unadjusted). Rimegepant decreased rectal compliance. No significant effects were noted during washout. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events of ≥ Grade 3 severity.

41643210,2026-02-06,Vascular transcriptional and metabolic changes precede progressive intra-renal microvascular rarefaction in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"Background: The mechanisms contributing to progressive kidney damage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) remain unclear. Renal microvascular (MV) rarefaction plays an important role in kidney disease, but its natural history, underlying mechanisms, and contributions to renal disease progression in ADPKD remain unknown. We hypothesized that intrarenal MV rarefaction is present early on and is preceded by vascular transcriptional and metabolic changes. Methods: Pkd1RC/RC and WT mice (n=16 each) were studied at 1, 6, and 12 months. Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured in vivo (MRI), whereas renal MV architecture (3D-micro-CT), capillary density, perivascular fibrosis, and histomorphometric parameters were assessed ex vivo. In randomly selected Pkd1RC/RC and WT kidneys (n=5, each/time point), mRNA-sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed vasculature-related genes (DEGs). Next, in young humans with ADPKD and matched controls (n=10 each), plasma cellular energy metabolites were determined (LC-MS/MS), validated in an extended cohort (n=32 and n=16, respectively), and correlated with markers of disease severity and progression. Gene-metabolite interaction networks were generated to integrate DEGs in Pkd1RC/RC at 1 month with metabolites dysregulated in individuals with ADPKD, which were further quantified in WT and Pkd1RC/RC kidneys. Results: Renal MV density was preserved at 1 month but progressively decreased at 6 and 12 months, associated with capillary loss and perivascular fibrosis. A total of 110, 48, and 201 DEGs were identified at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), homocysteine (Hcy) and asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) levels were higher in humans with ADPKD versus controls, interacted with DEGs implicated in inflammatory and innate immune response and Hcy metabolism, and correlated with TKV and renal blood flow. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that intrarenal MV abnormalities present early in ADPKD and are preceded by vascular transcriptional and metabolic changes. The renal microcirculation may constitute an important therapeutic target in ADPKD, and its underlying biomarkers may serve to monitor its progression.",American journal of physiology.

41642589,2026-02-06,Thyroidectomy Outcomes in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"A greater proportion of older patients (age ≥65 years) are undergoing thyroidectomy amidst an aging population. Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling.To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients.Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included.Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria.Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data.Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated.The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar.This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance.

41642247,2026-02-06,Urinary CXCL-9 Outperforms TNF-α for Non-invasive Diagnosis of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Acute Interstitial Nephritis.,"Although kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing immune checkpoint inhibitors-associated acute interstitial nephritis (ICI-AIN), several promising urinary biomarkers have emerged as potential non-invasive diagnostics. Notably, recent studies have highlighted tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL-9) and others as potential biomarkers to help distinguish ICI-AIN from other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, a direct systematic comparison between these two biomarkers in a cohort of patients undergoing immunotherapy has not been performed.We prospectively enrolled a cohort of ICI-treated cancer patients who developed AKI (including both ICI-AIN and ICI-Non-AIN AKI), as well as those without AKI, referred to as the internal validation cohort. Urinary CXCL-9 and TNF-α were measured across all groups using the human Quantikine ELISA Kit. We externally validated our findings in a cohort of biopsy proven ICI-AIN patients from Spain, referred to as the external validation cohort.Urinary CXCL-9 levels were significantly higher in ICI-AIN patients from Mayo (n=40) compared to those with ICI-Non-AIN AKI (n=36) and ICI-treated patients without AKI (n=16) (both p≤0.0001), these findings were confirmed in the validation cohort from Spain (n=19) with p-values of 0.0008 and <0.0001, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for urinary CXCL-9 distinguishing ICI-AIN biopsy proven (combined from both cohorts, n= 45) from ICI-Non-AIN AKI was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74-0.92), while for urinary TNF-α the AUC was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75).Increased urinary CXCL-9 was superior to TNF-α as a biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis of ICI-AIN, even after prior corticosteroid exposure, highlighting its promise as clinical diagnostic tool.© The Author(s) 2026.

41642095,2026-02-06,Underreported Demographic Factors in Apraxia of Speech Treatment Studies: Recommendations for Inclusive Research.,"While acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) has been the focus of intervention research for decades, little information is reported about the demographic representation of study participants. This article examines the extent to which published AOS treatment studies report participants' age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, language background, and socioeconomic status; identifies critical gaps in the literature; and considers implications for representativeness. This information supports the important call to capture these patient factors systematically and thereby advance equity in research and clinical care.This study is part of a larger systematic review examining treatment outcomes for acquired AOS. A comprehensive search of databases from 1951 to April 2024 was completed to determine the proportion of treatment articles that reported demographic information related to diversity. Studies were reviewed by trained raters using a standardized data extraction protocol with a consensus protocol.While participant age and sex/gender were reported in nearly all studies (99% and 100%, respectively), only 24% of studies reported on race/ethnicity, 15% provided information on participants' language background, and none reported socioeconomic status. Among studies that included race/ethnicity, 89% of the participants were White, with minimal representation of other racial/ethnic groups.The underreporting of race/ethnicity, language background, and socioeconomic factors limits the generalizability and ecological validity of AOS treatment research. The field must prioritize inclusive participant recruitment and consistent demographic reporting. We propose a practical template for use in both research and clinical contexts to support more thorough data collection and to inform future work in diagnosis, assessment, and intervention for AOS.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.31172353.","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR","Feb 05, 2026",2026.0,Feb,5.0,Lauren Bislick|Rene L Utianski|Charlotte King|Kate Nealon|Julie Wambaugh|Rachel Johnson|Katarina L Haley,Rene L Utianski,"School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Central Florida, Orlando.|Department of Neurology, Division of Speech Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of South Florida, Tampa.|Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Montclair State University, NJ.|Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City.|School of Speech-Language Pathology, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA.|Department of Health Sciences Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.","Lauren Bislick, Rene L Utianski, Charlotte King, Kate Nealon, Julie Wambaugh, Rachel Johnson, Katarina L Haley",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642095/,"Acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) is a condition that has been extensively studied, but the demographic representation of participants in treatment research is often overlooked.

41642007,2026-02-06,Prenatal Closure of Myeloschisis vs Myelomeningocele: Insights From the fMMC Consortium Registry.,"Myelomeningocele is defined by the presence of a fluid-filled sac that contains the neural placode and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the level of the spinal defect. Alternatively, the term myeloschisis is used when the neural placode is not contained within a CSF-filled sac. While both are eligible for prenatal closure, few studies have characterized the impact of the type of lesion on postnatal outcomes. This study compares the outcomes of these 2 types of open spinal dysraphism using data from the Fetal Myelomeningocele Consortium registry sponsored by the North American Fetal Therapy Network.The prospective observational Fetal Myelomeningocele Consortium registry was used to extract deidentified data corresponding to patients who underwent fetal closure of myelomeningocele vs myeloschisis. Demographics, operative characteristics, perioperative complications, and postnatal outcomes were collected.A total of 1327 patients were identified, including 991 (74.7%) with myelomeningocele and 336 (25.3%) with myeloschisis. Compared with myelomeningocele, myeloschisis was associated with lower rates of prenatal talipes (11% vs 24%, P < .001) and higher rates of favorable prenatal movement (94% vs 86%, P < .001). Postnatally, myeloschisis conferred higher rates of leg movement (97% vs 90%, P = .002) and an increased likelihood of ambulation in the household (10.4% vs 4.1%, P = .009) and outside (7.2% vs 1.9%, P = .004) at 1 year. However, myeloschisis was also linked to greater use of skin patches during closure (49% vs 27%, P < .001), higher CSF leak rates among those with wound dehiscence (26% vs 8%, P = .014), and more frequent CSF diversion and tethered cord surgeries at follow-up.Myeloschisis and myelomeningocele demonstrate distinct clinical profiles. Although patients with myeloschisis may have favorable motor outcomes, they are also characterized by higher rates of CSF leakage, CSF diversion, and tethered cord surgery. These findings highlight the need for lesion-specific prognostication and may inform surgical planning and parental counseling in the context of prenatal spina bifida closure.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2026.

41642001,2026-02-06,Neurapraxia in Time and Space.,"Since its introduction into medical terminology by Lord Henry Cohen in 1941, the term ""neurapraxia"" has become established in the neurological and neurosurgical lexicon, although it is often misused or misspelled. It denotes a transient dysfunction of a peripheral nerve, as distinct from axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which describe more significant structural injuries to a peripheral nerve. To expand our understanding of neurapraxia, it is necessary to examine the phenomenon in both temporal and spatial contexts. This study examines neurapraxia in: (A) Time-(1) the origins of the term neurapraxia and (2) the time-course of a neurapraxic injury and its recovery, and (B) Space-(3) the microstructure of a neurapraxic injury and (4) the locations of neurapraxic injuries within the peripheral nervous system. We demonstrate that the term neurapraxia encompasses both a temporal and a spatial definition. In time, it applies to transient peripheral nerve palsy, from which recovery occurs before there is sufficient time for axonal regeneration, typically within a few weeks. In space, there is a histopathological change limited to localized demyelination in nerves lined by epineurium and myelinated by Schwann cells. Nerves distal to the spine qualify as nerves to which the term neurapraxia can apply; however, cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots (including cauda equina) are inconsistent with this owing to the variability in myelinating cells along their course (oligodendroglia proximally, i.e., central glial segment), the absence of an epineurial covering, and exposure to cerebrospinal fluid.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2026.

41570344,2026-02-06,Converging laser-induced forward transfer and melt electrowriting for biofabrication of reinforced cartilage constructs.,"Microtissue-based strategies have gained significant attention for the fabrication of cartilage grafts. Their spatial organization within three-dimensional constructs plays a crucial role in directing tissue formation and maintaining the immediate mechanical stability of the printed structure. Melt-electrowritten (MEW) fibrous scaffolds have been widely used to reinforce cell-laden hydrogels, while also guiding microtissue fusion and self-organization within the constructs. However, current bioprinting methods used for positioning microtissues or spheroids within these structures are limited by insufficient control over spheroid deposition, low throughput, and technical challenges, such as nozzle-clogging. In this study, we leveraged laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) to print articular cartilage progenitor cell (ACPC) spheroids of two different sizes (Ø ∼80 and 150μm) into fibrous polycaprolactone scaffolds. We investigated the effects of laser energy, spheroid size, and concentration in the bioink to identify the key parameters for controlled deposition. Furthermore, we assessed print fidelity, post-print spheroid viability, and chondrogenic differentiation capacity. The deposition rate of the spheroids was studied to maximize transfer efficiency, and the resulting optimal parameters were subsequently applied to place the spheroids within the MEW meshes. However, the spheroid transfer efficiency remained limited, not due to shortcomings in the printing process, but because uniform encapsulation becomes challenging when working with discrete and larger entities, such as spheroids. While single cells benefit from homogeneous suspension, enabling random encapsulation, spheroids require precise targeting to be successfully transferred. To address this challenge, an AI-based imaging analysis system was employed, and the amount of bioink on the donor slide was reduced to improve the transfer of larger spheroids further. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the successful convergence between LIFT and MEW for the deposition of ACPC spheroids into reinforcing meshes as the next step towards automated production of tissue constructs.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Biofabrication,"Feb 05, 2026",2026.0,Feb,5.0,Antonia G Vasilopoulou|Núria Ginés Rodriguez|Ardalan Mansouri|Lennard Spauwen|Mathieu Loste-Berdot|Antonio Iazzolino|Marc Nicodeme|Luka Ilsievic|Jasmijn V Korpershoek|Riccardo Levato|Mylène de Ruijter|Jos Malda,Jasmijn V Korpershoek,"Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.|Regenerative Medicine Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.|University of Applied Sciences Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.|Poietis Biosystems, Bioparc Bordeaux Métropole, Pessac, France.|Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.","Antonia G Vasilopoulou, Núria Ginés Rodriguez, Ardalan Mansouri, Lennard Spauwen, Mathieu Loste-Berdot, Antonio Iazzolino, Marc Nicodeme, Luka Ilsievic, Jasmijn V Korpershoek, Riccardo Levato, Mylène de Ruijter, Jos Malda",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570344/,"Cartilage damage is a significant medical problem, and new strategies are needed to repair it.

Clinical and paraclinical data were collected. CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG-positive sera were tested using tissue indirect immunofluorescence assay, murine teased nerve fibers, and ELISAs for CASPR1 and CNTN1 to elucidate antigenic targets. Patients were compared with CNTN1-IgG and NF155-IgG4 autoimmune nodopathy cohorts.Among 17 CASPR1 or isolated CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG-seropositive patients identified, 14 had clinical data (CASPR1-IgG = 8 [50% males, median age 50 years], CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG = 6 [67% males, median age 42 years]). Neuropathic pain was more common in CASPR1-IgG (88% vs 33%), while sensory ataxia was more frequent in CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG cases (100% vs 75%). All showed primarily demyelinating electrophysiology (1 CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG case presented as chronic inflammatory sensory polyradiculopathy). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) refractoriness occurred in 63% of CASPR1-IgG and 40% of CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG. Rituximab was effective in 6 of 7 (86%) treated patients. One patient with CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG who was refractory to multiple immunotherapies underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant after which she was off immunotherapies and is in sustained remission for the past 10 years. CASPR1-IgG patients progressed faster to nadir than NF155-IgG4 (p = 0.003). CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG patients had more frequent asymmetric onset (p = 0.009) and greater long-term disability than NF155-IgG4 (p = 0.035). Five of the 7 CASPR1-IgG patients had IgG4 antibodies, compared with 2 of the 5 CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG patients. Four isolated CASPR1/CNTN1-complex-IgG sera tested positive by tissue immunofluorescence assay; 3 also bound paranodes on teased nerve fibers.

Eligible studies reported MRI feature frequencies or diagnostic accuracy for common soft-tissue tumor subtypes. Reviews, case reports, duplicates, non-English publications, and studies outside the scope were excluded. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2).Seventy-six studies met inclusion criteria. In lipomatous tumors, homogeneous fat signal and thin septa supported lipoma, whereas thick or nodular septa and enhancement favored atypical or well-differentiated liposarcoma. Myxofibrosarcoma often demonstrated an infiltrative fascial ""tail."" Vascular lesions included angioleiomyoma with a reticular T2 pattern and glomus tumor with marked T2 hyperintensity and avid enhancement. In peripheral nerve sheath tumors, lower apparent diffusion coefficient values and peritumoral edema favored malignancy. Heterogeneity in imaging protocols precluded meta-analysis; results were summarized descriptively by subtype.Consolidated MRI patterns-such as septal morphology in lipomatous tumors, the fascial tail in myxofibrosarcoma, characteristic T2 patterns in vascular lesions, and diffusion and edema cues in nerve sheath tumors-support differentiation of benign and malignant entities, enhance reader confidence, and inform biopsy and management.

The present study aims to empirically examine a theoretical model that posits that the observation of weight stigma in the medical training context drives anti-fat dislike via its effects on trainees' body image and subsequent activation of weight-based stereotypes (i.e., controllability beliefs).Data were collected from the Medical Student Cognitive Habits and Change Evaluation Study (CHANGES), a national longitudinal study conducted between 2010 and 2017. Medical students from 49 allopathic U.S. medical schools were surveyed at year 4 of medical school (MS4; N = 3,976), year 2 of residency (PGY2; N = 3,579), and year 3 of residency (PGY3; N = 3,057). A serial parallel mediation analysis using structural equation modeling was used to evaluate our model.Our model was largely supported; observations of weight stigma during medical school were directly and indirectly associated with greater anti-fat dislike at PGY3 via fear of weight gain and controllability beliefs about weight.Anti-fat prejudice reduction interventions in the medical training environment should (1) emphasize the importance of, and increase adherence to, positive attitudinal role modeling among faculty and residents, (2) promote body self-acceptance among trainees, and (3) provide education around the complex interplay of genetic and environmental contributors to combat blame-based stereotypes surrounding weight.Data were collected from the Medical Student Cognitive Habits and Change Evaluation Study (CHANGES), a national longitudinal study conducted between 2010 and 2017.

41645667,2026-02-07,The deep brain stimulation response network in Parkinson's disease operates in the high beta band.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Using functional MRI, optimal DBS response networks have been characterized. However, neural activity associated with Parkinsonian symptoms is magnitudes faster than what can be resolved by this method. Although both spatial and temporal domains of these networks appear crucial, no single study has yet investigated both domains simultaneously. Here, we aimed at closing this gap by analysing electrophysiological data from a total of n = 127 hemispheres. Using subthalamic local field potentials that were recorded concurrently alongside whole-brain magnetoencephalography in a multi-centre cohort of patients who underwent subthalamic DBS for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (n = 100 hemispheres), we analysed the DBS response network in both spatial and temporal domains. In every cortical vertex, cortico-subthalamic coupling was correlated with stimulation outcomes. This network spatially resembled functional MRI-based findings (R = 0.40, P = 0.039) and explained significant amounts of variance in clinical outcomes (βstd = 0.30, P = 0.002), whereas theta-alpha and low beta coupling did not show significant associations with DBS response (theta-alpha: βstd = -0.02, P = 0.805; low beta: βstd = -0.08, P = 0.426). The 'optimal' high beta coupling map was robust when subjected to various cross-validation designs (10-fold cross-validation: R = 0.29, P = 0.009; split-half design: R = 0.31, P = 0.026) and was able to predict outcomes across DBS centres [R = 0.74; P(1) = 8.9 × 10-5]. We identified a DBS response network that resembles the previously defined MRI network and operates in the high beta band. Maximal connectivity to this network was associated with optimal DBS outcomes and was able to cross-predict clinical improvements across DBS surgeons and centres.© The Author(s) 2026.

41645906,2026-02-07,Genome and Transcriptome-Wide Analyses Identify Multiple Candidate Genes and a Significant Polygenic Contribution in Bicuspid Aortic Valve.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a frequent congenital heart defect with a high heritability. Despite this, only a limited number of genes have been associated with the disease, and the molecular mechanisms remain unexplained in most cases. This study aimed to further understand the genetic architecture of BAV.A genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 9631 cases among 65 677 participants was performed. Genes were prioritized using transcriptomic analyses based on RNA sequencing in relevant tissues, including human fetal and adult aortic valves. The impact of the knockdown or knockout of 4 candidate genes on cardiac development was verified in zebrafish. A polygenic risk score was developed, its association with BAV was evaluated in an independent cohort, and its association with a wide range of phenotypes (n=976) was evaluated in UK Biobank (n=355 618 individuals).Thirty-six genomic loci were identified, including 32 that were not described previously. Among the prioritized genes, KANK2 and ERBB4 were identified as potentially causal through transcriptomic analyses, colocalization, and Mendelian randomization based on gene expression in human aortic valves (n=484), whereas PRDM6 and STRN were prioritized using similar analyses from aortic (n=326) and left ventricular tissues (n=326), respectively. Targeting 4 candidate genes (WNT4, LEF1, STRN, and KANK2) in zebrafish led to disruption in cardiac development. A polygenic risk score was associated with an odds ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.90-2.25; P=5.43×10-62) per SD for BAV and significantly associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank.This study supports a significant polygenic contribution to BAV, where the combination of multiple common variants in genes involved in heart morphogenesis disrupts aortic valve development.",Circulation,"Feb 06, 2026",2026.0,Feb,6.0,Sébastien Thériault|Jacob A Holdcraft|Dinara Sharipova|Adèle Faucherre|Radoslaw M Debiec|Gina M Peloso|Baravan Al-Kassou|Sary Aranki|Elena Ashikhmina Swan|Andrea Ballotta|Michele Bellino|Hanna M Björck|Anne S Boureau|Peter S Braund|François Corriveau|François Dagenais|Lasse Folkersen|Amalia Forte|Michael D Francke|Alessandro Frigiola|Svetlana Gorbatov|Dongchuan Guo|Karam M Habchi|Mahyar Heydarpour|Eric M Isselbacher|Chris Jopling|Fabien Laporte|Solena Le Scouarnec|Zhonglin Li|Peter Lichtner|Carlo Maj|Hasanga D Manikpurage|Christopher P Nelson|Thy B Nguyen|Russell A Norris|Chin S Ong|Philippe Pibarot|Tanmoy Roychowdhury|Berardo Sarubbi|Floriane Simonet|Thoralf Sundt|Ida Surakka|Idit Tessler|Cristen J Willer|Susanne Wittmann|Bo Yang|Igor Berezovets|Stefanie A Doppler|Martina Dreßen|Katharina Knoll|Thomas Puehler|Heribert Schunkert|Jean-François F Avierinos|Malenka M Bissell|Aidan P Bolger|Yohan Bossé|Eduardo Bossone|María Brion|Rodolfo Citro|Carlo de Vincentiis|G M Deeb|Alessandro Della Corte|Christian Dina|Ronen Durst|Stephan Ensminger|Per Eriksson|Arturo Evangelista|Anders Franco-Cereceda|Dan Gilon|Betti Giusti|Simon L Hetherington|Gordon S Huggins|Markus Krane|Thierry Le Tourneau|Giuseppe Limongelli|Patrick Mathieu|David Messika-Zeitoun|Hector I Michelena|Dianna Milewicz|Jochen D Muehlschlegel|David R Murdock|Georg Nickenig|Stefano Nistri|Markus M Nöthen|Francesca Pluchinotta|Siddharth K Prakash|Nilesh J Samani|Jean-Jacques J Schott|Tom R Webb|Stéphane Zaffran|Salim Abdelilah-Seyfried|Kim Eagle|Johannes Schumacher|Teresa Trenkwalder|Simon Body,Elena Ashikhmina Swan,"Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec (S.T., F.D., Z.L., H.D.M., P.P., Y.B., P.M.).|Department of Animal Physiology, Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Germany (D.S., S.A.-S.).|IGF, University of Montpellier, CNRS, INSERM, France (A.

Despite advances in neoadjuvant and surgical management, up to 30% of patients ultimately require a permanent fecal diversion.To evaluate stoma-free survival and identify factors associated with permanent stoma formation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing coloanal anastomosis.Retrospective cohort study.Single tertiary referral center, 2017-2021.A total of 126 patients with clinical stage II-III rectal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy and underwent curative-intent resection with coloanal anastomosis were included.Curative-intent resection with coloanal anastomosis.The primary outcome was stoma-free survival. Secondary analyses examined factors associated with permanent fecal diversion.One hundred twenty-six patients were analyzed, comprising 62.5% males, with a mean age of 54 ± 10 years and a median body mass index of 27.7 kg/m 2 (interquartile range: 24.5-31.4 kg/m 2). At a median follow-up of 53.0 months, the 5-year stoma-free survival rate was 88.9%. Univariate Cox-regression analysis showed that body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m 2 (Hazard Ratio=3.80, 95% confidence interval:1.04-13.91, p = 0.044) and handsewn coloanal anastomosis with mucosectomy compared to stapled coloanal anastomosis without mucosectomy (Hazard Ratio=5.58, 95% confidence interval:1.71-18.14, p = 0.004), as well as local recurrence (Hazard Ratio=6.51, 95% confidence interval:1.44-29.46) were associated with worse stoma-free survival. The 30-day major morbidity rate was 7.9% following the index surgery. Sixteen patients required permanent fecal diversion due to bowel dysfunction (n = 11), disease recurrence (n = 4), bowel obstruction (n = 1).Retrospective, single-institution design with limited generalizability.Coloanal anastomosis in the total neoadjuvant therapy era resulted in favorable 5-year stoma-free survival. Body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2 handsewn coloanal anastomosis with mucosectomy, and local recurrence were associated with worse stoma-free survival.

We describe an integrated histomolecular evaluation including high-resolution copy number profiling of a series of 60 DHG-H3 G34 to further our understanding of the spectrum of genetic changes associated with this tumor type. Cases were clinically tested using an 187-gene mutation and fusion targeted neuro-oncology next-generation sequencing panel (n = 60) and Oncoscan chromosomal microarray (n = 26) by a single laboratory (2018-2022). A subset of cases had immunohistochemical results for OLIG2 (n = 42), p53 (n = 48), and ATRX (n = 46), and methylation array data (n = 8). Median age at testing was 21 years (range, 12-50). No significant difference was noted in clinical, histopathological, and mutational profile between pediatric and adult patients. H3-3A G34 mutations included G34R (n = 56; 94%), G34V (n = 3), and a non-canonical G34E (n = 1). Concurrent mutations most often involved TP53 (n = 55; 92%), ATRX (n = 50; 83%), and PDGFRA (n = 34; 57%). A reportedly primary tumor was confirmed to be hypermutant and had a PMS2 mutation. A single case also showed an FGFR3::FAM184B fusion. All cases with available chromosomal microarray data had unbalanced genomes, which were often complex (14/26; 54%). The most frequent recurrent copy number abnormalities were losses involving 3q, 4q, 10q, 13q, and 18q, and 17p copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) encompassing TP53. This copy number profile was reminiscent of that seen in Grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Collectively, a TP53 abnormality at copy number (12/26, all cnLOH), sequence (55/60) and protein expression (46/48) level was detected in all 60 cases. In conclusion, integrated high-resolution copy number and histomolecular analysis expanded the spectrum of genetic changes associated with DHG-H3 G34, including the presence of universal TP53 abnormalities with frequent cnLOH-a copy number abnormality that has been largely unrecognized-for this new 2021 World Health Organization central nervous system tumor type.© 2026 The Author(s).

41650063,2026-02-07,High NKAP expression predicts poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.,"NF-κB activating protein (NKAP) plays important roles in various cancers, including breast cancer. However, its expression and prognosis value in breast cancer remains uncertain. Gene expression profiling interactive analysis, Human protein atlas database, and University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer data analysis portal database were used to predict the expression and prognostic value of NKAP in breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to detect NKAP expression. The effects of NKAP on cell proliferation, migration and drug sensitivity were investigated in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells. NKAP protein expression differed in breast cancer tissues and paraneoplastic tissues based on the cancer genome atlas data. The high NKAP expression was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The results of immunohistochemistry, western blot assay, and qRT-PCR proved that NKAP was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with paraneoplastic tissues. In addition, qRT-PCR results showed that high expression of NKAP was significantly correlated with the larger tumor size and higher TNM stage. Moreover, knockdown of NKAP significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and enhanced drug sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells. NKAP is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, and its high expression is closely associated with poor prognosis. NKAP also promotes proliferation, migration, and inhibits drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells.Copyright © 2026 the Author(s).

To uncover mechanisms of a long-lasting immune memory, we contrasted varicella zoster virus antigen-specific memory T cell responses in adults vaccinated at young (<20 years) or older age (>50 years) with a live-attenuated vaccine conferring durable protection only when given at young age or with an adjuvanted component vaccine eliciting long-lasting immunity in older adults. Unlike VZV-specific CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells exhibited profound age-sensitive changes including memory subset shifts, reduced T cell receptor diversity, and loss of stem-like features. Vaccination of older adults with the adjuvanted vaccine did not restore CD8+ defects but selectively enhanced T helper 17 (TH17) CD4+ T cells and prevented their conversion into regulatory T cells, likely through lipid metabolic regulation. Thus, durable vaccine efficacy with aging relies on antigen-specific TH17 cells that compensate for CD8+ T cell defects.",Science advances,"Feb 06, 2026",2026.0,Feb,6.0,Ines Sturmlechner|Abhinav Jain|Jingjing Jiang|Hirohisa Okuyama|Yunmei Mu|Maryam Own|Cornelia M Weyand|Jörg J Goronzy,Ines Sturmlechner|Abhinav Jain|Jingjing Jiang|Hirohisa Okuyama|Yunmei Mu|Maryam Own|Cornelia M Weyand|Jörg J Goronzy,"Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.|Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.|Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.","Ines Sturmlechner, Abhinav Jain, Jingjing Jiang, Hirohisa Okuyama, Yunmei Mu, Maryam Own, Cornelia M Weyand, Jörg J Goronzy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41650263/,"Older adults are susceptible to infections due to waning immune memory.

41650288,2026-02-07,A Case of Malignant Melanoma With Numerous Wagner-Meissner-Like Bodies.,"Melanoma exhibits a broad spectrum of histopathologic variations, including rare forms with neural differentiation. Neurotropism in melanoma encompasses both perineural invasion and neural-like transformation, but the prognostic implications of these features remain uncertain. Although (peri)neural invasion is well documented, true neural differentiation in melanomas is exceedingly rare. In this study, we describe an unusual case of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma exhibiting extensive Wagner-Meissner-like bodies, a feature more commonly associated with benign neural tumors and nevi. In this case, histopathology revealed a dual-component lesion with a neurotized and an epithelioid melanocytic component, both showing PRAME expression and p16 loss. Chromosomal microarray identified heterozygous loss of 9p22.1p13.1 (including CDKN2A/CDKN2B), and loss of 10q22.2q26.3 (including PTEN), supporting malignancy. These findings suggest that in this case, Wagner-Meissner-like bodies likely represent neurotization rather than a benign or collision lesion, highlighting the need for integrated histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis in challenging melanocytic neoplasms.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41651468,2026-02-07,Energy and Fluid Balance During a 214km Winter Ultra Endurance Race: A Case Study.,"The upper limits for total energy expenditure (TEE) and water turnover (rH2O) in humans have been reported during several continuous single-day ultra-endurance races (running, cycling, triathlon). Currently, the upper limits for TEE and rH2O during continuous single-day activity in cold weather (<0C) remain unknown. The Arrowhead Ultra is one of the coldest ultra-endurance races in North America and provides a unique opportunity to answer these questions. Racers select a bicycle, cross-country skis, or foot travel to traverse a 214km snow-covered trail (altitude range 345-426m, 2,030m elevation gain). Historically, ~1/2 of the racers complete the event. In this case study, we assessed TEE and rH2O from the racer (cyclist, age:22yrs, height:1.84m, body mass:87.7kg, VO2max:5.0LO2.min-1) who won the 2025 Arrowhead Ultra (17.9hr, -13--1C) using the doubly labeled water method. Total energy and fluid intake were recorded to assess energy and fluid balance. Mean heart rate was 141bpm (71% of maximum heart rate). TEE was 63.9MJ (15,273kcals, 9.6x basal metabolic rate) while total energy intake was 33.2MJ (7,941kcal). Mean carbohydrate intake was 88g.hr-1. Water turnover was 17.7L yielding a rH2O/TEE ratio of 0.28L.MJ-1 for the race. The cyclist demonstrated high TEE and rH2O that were comparable to values from other ultra-endurance athletes competing in a range of temperatures (3-34C). Notably, rH2O from this cyclist was higher compared to athletes performing other ultra-type endeavors in cold weather conditions (-25--19C). Our observations shed light on energy and fluid demands during continuous single-day activity in the cold and have endurance training and performance implications.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Feb 06, 2026",2026.0,Feb,6.0,Kyle W Wehmanen|Brent C Ruby|Timothy C Shriver|Michele N Ravelli|Shalaya Kipp|John McDaniel|Erich J Petushek|Steven J Elmer,Shalaya Kipp,"Department of Kinesiology & Integrative Physiology, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA.|Montana Center for Work Physiology and Exercise Metabolism, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA.|Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Biotechnology Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.|Department of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|School of Health Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.|Department of Psychology & Human Factors, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA.|Doctor of Physical Therapy Program, St. Catherine University, St. Paul, MN, USA.","Kyle W Wehmanen, Brent C Ruby, Timothy C Shriver, Michele N Ravelli, Shalaya Kipp, John McDaniel, Erich J Petushek, Steven J Elmer",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41651468/,"This study examined the energy and fluid balance of an athlete competing in an extremely challenging 214km winter ultra-endurance race.

41651674,2026-02-07,Index Hospital Costs and Postoperative Outcomes of Lumbar Spine Fusion With FIBERGRAFT Vs Bone Morphogenic Protein-2: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.,"There are limited data available to understand the value of bioactive glass for spinal fusion procedures. Bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) is an established graft that has been on the market for roughly 24 years, while bioactive glass represents a newer class of graft technology. The objective of this study is to compare economic, health care utilization, and postoperative outcomes associated with the use of a bioactive glass vs BMP-2.A retrospective, comparative study was conducted to compare a bioactive glass, FIBERGRAFT (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA), to BMP-2. The Premier hospital billing database was used. Patients who underwent lumbar fusion from 2016 to 2024 with bioactive glass or BMP-2 were included. The primary study outcome was index hospital cost. The exploratory outcomes were length of stay, operation room time, and 1-year pseudarthrosis, spinal infection overall (defined as the presence of spinal infection or surgical site infection), and surgical site infection only. Patients in each graft group were balanced using propensity score matching. Analyses were conducted for the overall cohort (primary) and, as a sensitivity analysis, for a subset of patients based on primary procedure and diagnosis.The group sizes for each cohort before balancing were 1,013 and 59,394 patients for bioactive glass and BMP-2, respectively. After matching, the group sizes for both grafts were 1013 patients for a total of 2026 patients in the matched cohort. In the matched cohort, 65 to 74 years was the most frequent age group (34% in each cohort), and more than half were women (57% bioactive glass, 56% BMP-2). The mean (95% CI) index hospital costs were $40,187 ($39,132, $41,241) for bioactive glass and $45,010 ($43,809, $46,211) for BMP-2, representing a mean difference (95% CI) of -$4823 ($-6382, $-3265), P < 0.001. The exploratory endpoints were similar for both grafts. Both the primary and sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results.This study suggests that patients who undergo lumbar fusion with bioactive glass have lower index costs and similar health care resource utilization and postoperative outcomes compared with those who receive BMP-2. Results from this study may help payers, health care systems, and providers make value-based decisions regarding product utilization.This research provides an understanding of hospital costs, health care resource utilization, and 1-year outcomes of bioactive glass used in lumbar fusion surgery using a comparative study design.This manuscript is generously published free of charge by ISASS, the International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery.

This study reviewed the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of L. monocytogenes in South Africa. The random-effect model meta-analysis was used to determine the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) of L. monocytogenes isolates and their antibiotic resistance (AR) profiles from humans, food and the environmental samples. Original peer reviewed articles published from January 1 1990 to March 23 2024, were searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus, and African Journal Online databases. Comprehensive meta-analysis version 4.0 (CMA) software was used to calculate the PPE. A total of 2,931 samples (n = 1150 from humans, n = 1631 from food, and n = 150 from the environment) derived from 32 articles were incorporated into the meta-analysis. The overall PPE of L. monocytogenes was 73.3%, 33.5% and 44.5%, from human, food, and the environment samples, respectively. The L. monocytogenes serotype 4b-4d-4e had the highest PPE (19.5%). The AR profiles were screened from 1806 L. monocytogenes isolates with the overall multi-drug resistance PPE was 26.3%. The sulII resistance gene, which encodes a drug-resistant dihydropteroate synthase enzyme conferring resistance to sulfonamides, exhibited the highest prevalence of PPE at 47.3%. Among the isolates of L. monocytogenes from South Africa, the inlJ and inlB genes had high PPE values of 83.5% and 80.5%, respectively. These observations clearly demonstrate that L. monocytogenes is pathogen of ""One Health"" importance, which should not be under estimated.

Key eligibility criteria included age 18 years or older, performance status of 0-1, measurable disease, platinum-resistant disease and histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints included CA-125 response. The effect of combined epigenetic and immunotherapy was evaluated by transcriptomic analyses of 72 serially biopsied tumors.We show that the combination is moderately well tolerated and most common grade 3-4 adverse events are gastrointestinal side effects and anemia. ORR is 2.9% and DCR is 50%; with 3 of the 27 evaluable patients attaining a CA-125 response. Differential gene expression analyses reveal an upregulation of inflammatory and cytolytic genes and co-inhibitory checkpoints 6 weeks on-therapy. Upregulation of interferon signaling, antigen presentation and immune cell adhesion and migration gene sets are prominent on-therapy, together with an increase in density of CD8 + T-cells. Patients with a CA-125 and/or clinical response show an enrichment of adaptive and conserved immune response gene sets on-therapy.Our findings highlight the potential of epigenetic modulators to re-shape the tumor microenvironment of PROC toward a more inflammed phenotype and may point to approaches to augment immunotherapy response.© 2026.

41650184,2026-02-07,Gut microbiome compositional clusters in association with cardiovascular risk: An observational cohort study.,"The gut microbiome (GM) is increasingly recognized for its role in atherosclerosis development. However, its potential as a biomarker for risk-stratification in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities remains under-explored. This study aimed to identify distinct GM clusters associated with elevated CV risk.In this prospective observational cohort, patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes mellitus referring to Mayo Clinic from 2013 to 2018 were enrolled. Bacterial DNA was analyzed in the V3-V5 region of 16S rDNA. Beta-diversity was plotted using Principal Coordinates Analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the GM classified participants into two clusters. Cox regression evaluated the association between clusters and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance identified clinical factors contributing to cluster assignment. Linear Discriminant analysis identified GM taxa with differential abundance among clusters and their effect sizes.Among 211 participants (median age 60 [IQR: 50-70] years; 57.3% male), two distinct GM profiles emerged (Cluster H: N = 104; Cluster L: N = 107, P < 0.001). Cluster L participants were younger (P < 0.001), more likely female (P = 0.009), and had healthier CV profiles, including lower BMI (P = 0.007), hypertension (P = 0.010), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.005), and lower coronary artery disease prevalence (P = 0.003). Over a median follow-up of 7.4 years, Cluster L had a significantly lower incidence of MACE compared to Cluster H (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.91, P = 0.024). Cluster L had higher operational taxonomic units (P < 0.001) and lower Bacillota-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (P < 0.001) compared to Cluster H. The predominant taxa in Cluster L included Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Parabacteroides, whereas Blautia, Agathobacter, and Clostridium sensu stricto-1 were more abundant in Cluster H.Distinct GM profiles are associated with varying CV risk, highlighting the potential of unsupervised GM profiling as a novel tool for risk stratification and individualized therapy.Copyright: © 2026 Hamidabad et al.

41650211,2026-02-07,Genetic ablation of interleukin-17A augments fibrosis in a mouse model of cholestatic liver injury.,"The underlying mechanisms contributing to cholestatic liver injury remain unclear. The pro-inflammatory leukocyte-restricted cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has been implicated in human cholestatic liver injury. However, mechanistic insights are lacking and require further exploration in preclinical models. Herein, we examined the effect of IL-17A genetic ablation in a mouse model of cholestatic liver injury.Age and gender-matched littermate wild type (WT) and Il-17a-/- C57BL/6 mice were fed an intermittent 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet for 21 days to induce cholestatic liver injury or a control diet.As compared to WT littermates, Il-17a-/- mice displayed more abundant desmin-positive myofibroblasts and increased fibrosis. NanoString analysis of intrahepatic leukocyte populations using a fibrosis-related gene panel identified upregulation of Tnfsf14 (encoding the protein LIGHT) in the DDC-fed Il-17a-/- mice. Although mass cytometry identified an increase in myeloid cells in both genotypes of the DDC-fed mice, we could not identify LIGHT expression in this cell lineage. Instead, the upregulation of LIGHT expression was largely restricted to a CD4+ T cell population as assessed by flow cytometry. Enhanced LIGHT expression was observed in a Th1+ CD4+ T cell population. LIGHT activated primary human hepatic stellate cells in vitro, suggesting that LIGHT stimulation of hepatic fibrogenesis may be direct.Taken together, these data suggest that IL-17A restrains expression of the profibrogenic cytokine, LIGHT, by Th1-polarized CD4+ T cells, and implicate a role for LIGHT in cholestatic fibrogenesis in DDC-fed mice; a finding which requires validation in additional models.Copyright: © 2026 Kitagataya et al.

41654324,2026-02-08,Clinical Features and Dental Pathologies in Maxillary Sinus Fungal Balls and Odontogenic Sinusitis.,"While maxillary sinus fungal balls (MSFB) can be associated with odontogenic conditions (MSFBO), MSFBO clinical and dental features have not been compared to odontogenic sinusitis (ODS). This multicenter study aimed to compare characteristics of MSFB, MSFBO, and ODS.A multicenter international retrospective cohort study was conducted on adults with MSFBs and ODS who underwent sinus surgery. First in MSFBs, it was determined whether different dental conditions were more likely in FB versus non-FB sides. Second, clinical features and dental pathologies were compared between MSFBO and ODS. For analyses, dental conditions were considered individually and as two groups: infectious pathologies and dental/oral procedures with indwelling metallic materials.After exclusions, there were 203 MSFBs and 163 ODS. Among MSFBs, 141 were MSFBOs. FB sides were associated with sinus protrusion of root canal treatment (RCT) materials (p = 0.040) and dental implants (p = 0.040). Compared to MSFBO, ODS patients were younger, more likely to have MS purulence (OR = 40.9, p < 0.010), more likely associated with apical periodontitis (OR = 2.59, p = 0.010) and oroantral fistulas (OR = 6.94, p = 0.020), and less likely associated with extruded RCT materials (OR = 0.01, p = 0.010) and protruded midface screws (OR < 0.01, p = 0.010). Comparing purulent MSFBO and ODS, ODS was more associated with infectious dental pathologies (p < 0.009).Compared to MSFBs, MSFBOs were associated with RCT extrusion and implant protrusion. Compared to MSFBOs, ODS was more likely purulent and associated with infectious dental pathologies. While ODS is often distinct from MSFBO, the two conditions can coexist, and surgeons must determine whether patients have infectious dental pathology requiring treatment with both conditions.© 2026 The Author(s).

Our aim was to derive and externally validate a VTE risk prediction model in patients with ALL receiving asparaginase-based induction. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients (aged ≥18 years) with newly diagnosed ALL receiving asparaginase-based induction. The derivation and external validation cohorts included 306 and 94 patients, respectively. Primary outcome was VTE at any site. A cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model stratified by thromboprophylaxis and center was performed to identify VTE risk factors in the derivation cohort. A risk prediction model for VTE at 30 days was derived using variables with P value < .05 in the multivariable model and was tested in the validation cohort. VTE risk factors on multivariable analysis in the derivation cohort included D-dimer ≥1 μg fibrinogen equivalent unit per mL (hazard ratio [HR], 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-6.5) and hemoglobin (HR for each 1 g/dL increment, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34) at ALL diagnosis. A VTE risk score based on these variables distinguished between a 4% (95% CI, 0.72-12) and 20% (95% CI, 14-27) 30-day cumulative incidence of VTE in the derivation cohort, with similar findings in the validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.56). The negative predictive value for VTE at 30 days was 96% and 93% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, and the positive predictive value was 20% in both.

41662718,2026-02-10,How Would You Manage This Patient With Idiopathic Acute Pancreatitis? Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.,"Acute pancreatitis is among the most frequent gastroenterologic reasons for hospitalization in the United States. This condition is associated with significant morbidity, including recurrent acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Although most patient cases are due to biliary disease and ethanol, approximately 18% are idiopathic. Diagnostic and management options for idiopathic acute pancreatitis include genetic testing for a number of associated mutations and cholecystectomy to treat subclinical or undetected biliary disease. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, often with concomitant endoscopic sphincterotomy, is also sometimes considered in the management of idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis, although the role of this invasive procedure is generally limited. Here, 2 pancreatologists and coauthors of a recent American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of acute pancreatitis discuss issues related to genetic testing, cholecystectomy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy for patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis in general, and for a young woman recently diagnosed with this condition.",Annals of internal medicine,"Feb 10, 2026",2026.0,Feb,10.0,Zahir Kanjee|Santhi S Vege|Sunil G Sheth|Joséphine A Cool,Santhi S Vege,"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (Z.K., S.G.S., J.A.C.).|Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota (S.S.V.).","Zahir Kanjee, Santhi S Vege, Sunil G Sheth, Joséphine A Cool",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41662718/,"Acute pancreatitis is a common and serious medical condition that can lead to significant complications.

41657084,2026-02-10,Predictive value of 6-minute walk test for weight loss after bariatric and metabolic surgery in individuals with class III obesity.,"Class III obesity is associated with wide variability in early weight-loss response after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), creating a need for simple preoperative measures that can help stratify risk for early nonresponse.To determine whether preoperative physical functional capacity, assessed by the six-minute walk test (6MWT), predicts short-term weight loss outcomes following MBS.In this retrospective study, a total of 164 adults (mean age = 43.1 ± 10.9 years) with class III obesity underwent MBS, predominantly laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Three 6MWT models using (1) absolute distance, (2) percentage of predicted distance, and (3) 6MWT/body mass index (BMI) were evaluated to predict nonresponse, defined as less than 45% excess BMI loss at six months. Patients were split into development and validation cohorts. Predictive performance was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.Patients achieved a total body weight loss of 26.0 ± 6.9% and excess BMI loss of 57.3 ± 18.0% (76.6% follow-up). Model 3 showed the strongest predictive performance (development AUC = 0.74; validation AUC = 0.78). Model 1 demonstrated high sensitivity (0.83) but lower discrimination (validation AUC = 0.67).Preoperative 6MWT performance provides promising prognostic information for early nonresponse to weight loss following MBS. The 6MWT/BMI ratio showed the strongest and most consistent predictive performance within our cohort, supporting its potential role as a valuable supplementary risk stratification tool. Absolute 6MWT distance may serve as a high-sensitivity screening tool. When used in conjunction with other clinical assessments, this two-step approach may help identify patients at risk for nonresponse and guide targeted perioperative interventions.",Physiotherapy theory and practice,"Feb 09, 2026",2026.0,Feb,9.0,Sunghwan Choi|Eunse Park|Dilbar Abdurakhimova|Heidi C Bednarchuk|Joy M Macheel|Wootaek Lim,Sunghwan Choi|Dilbar Abdurakhimova|Heidi C Bednarchuk|Joy M Macheel,"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN , USA.|Department of Physical Therapy, University of North Georgia, Dahlonega, GA , USA.|Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN , USA.|Department of Bariatric Surgery, Mayo Clinic Health System, Mankato, MN , USA.|Program in Physical Therapy at Mayo School of Health Sciences, Rochester, MN , USA.|Department of Physical Therapy, Woosong University, Daejeon, South Korea.","Sunghwan Choi, Eunse Park, Dilbar Abdurakhimova, Heidi C Bednarchuk, Joy M Macheel, Wootaek Lim",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41657084/,"Individuals with class III obesity often have variable weight loss after metabolic and bariatric surgery, creating a need for simple pre-operative measures to predict outcomes.

Patients were divided into three groups: Stage 0-2 CD; Stage 3-4 CD, isolated AS (Stage 3-4 CD without significant concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mitral annular calcification, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or cardiac amyloidosis); Stage 3-4 CD, AS with comorbidities (Stage 3-4 CD with ≥ 1 of these comorbidities). Futility was defined as death or Stage 3-4 New York Heart Association class dyspnoea 1 year after TAVI.Of 985 included patients, 822 (83%) had Stage 1-2 CD; 101 (10%) had Stage 3-4 CD, isolated AS; and 62 (6%) had Stage 3-4 CD, AS with comorbidities. Futility was not more common in Stage 3-4 CD groups (Stage 1-2 CD, 10%; Stage 3-4 CD, isolated AS, 17%; Stage 3-4 CD, AS with comorbidities, 15%, P = 0.09). Baseline and 1-year NYHA class were higher in Stage 3-4 CD compared with Stage 1-2 CD (P < 0.01). The 6 min walking test distance increased similarly in all groups at 1 year.Potential comorbidities contributing to right heart dysfunction were common among patients in Stage 3-4 CD undergoing TAVI. Stage 3-4 CD was not associated with a significantly higher risk of futility, irrespective of comorbidities, and they experienced a similar functional improvement after TAVI.© The Author(s) 2025.

41355285,2026-02-10,Current and future use of artificial intelligence in valvular heart disease imaging.,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) remains significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. This review examines an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced 'spoke-hub-node' care model designed to improve the early detection, risk stratification, and treatment of VHD. In this model, AI tools-such as automated ECG interpretation, digital stethoscopes, and point-of-care ultrasound-facilitate decentralized screening and referral for cardiac imaging at the community level. During the transition from outpatient settings to tertiary care centres, AI-integrated echocardiography, cardiac tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging facilitate advanced diagnostic evaluation and inform procedural planning. We review emerging innovations that can enhance this model of care delivery-including unsupervised machine learning to uncover novel VHD phenotypes, generative AI for automated reporting, the use of digital twins to simulate interventions, and the integration of multiple AI agents to support heart team meetings. These advances are followed by the emerging use of AI in robotic transoesophageal and intracardiac echocardiography, as well as in fusion fluoroscopy imaging, to guide valve interventions. While outlining the challenges inherent in this rapidly evolving field, the review's central contribution is its vision to connect the continuum-from AI-enabled community screening to personalized, image-guided therapies at tertiary care centres-offering a scalable and equitable model for VHD care.© The Author(s) 2025.

41365324,2026-02-10,Randomized controlled trials in valvular heart disease: the evolving role of multimodality imaging.,"Valvular heart disease represents a significant global health burden, with an estimated prevalence of 2.5% in high-income countries and projected increases due to population ageing. Randomized controlled trials in valvular heart disease have undergone substantial evolution, shifting from mortality-focused endpoints toward comprehensive assessments integrating imaging parameters and patient-centered outcomes. Cardiovascular imaging modalities, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance, have become pivotal in trial design, patient selection, and endpoint definition. Recent landmark trials in aortic stenosis, including EARLY-TAVR and EVOLVED, have challenged traditional symptom-based intervention thresholds by incorporating imaging biomarkers of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and cardiac damage staging. In aortic regurgitation, the paucity of randomized controlled trials evidence contrasts with emerging transcatheter technologies, highlighting critical knowledge gaps. Mitral regurgitation trials have demonstrated the importance of patient phenotyping, with divergent outcomes between COAPT and MITRA-FR emphasizing the role of imaging in optimal patient selection. The recent TRILUMINATE and TRISCEND trials have transformed tricuspid regurgitation management through transcatheter interventions, prioritizing quality-of-life improvements alongside traditional clinical endpoints. Future directions include standardization of imaging protocols across modalities, development of artificial intelligence-enhanced analysis, and integration of multiparametric biomarkers for personalized risk stratification. The paradigm shift toward imaging-guided, patient-centered trial design represents a fundamental reimagining of therapeutic success in valvular heart disease, moving beyond procedural outcomes toward comprehensive assessment of clinical benefit and improved patient care.© The Author(s) 2025.

In 71 medically hospitalized adolescents with AN/atypical AN, relative weight gain, measured via change in BMI z-scores, was assessed over 12-months of outpatient treatment following hospitalization and compared for premorbid weight status. Patients with premorbid overweight/obesity had a longer illness duration (p = .03) and more weight loss (p < .001) than patients with premorbid normal weight, and less weight gain at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-discharge (all p's ≤ .01). Premorbid weight status was not associated with treatment dropout, medical readmissions, psychiatric hospitalizations, or psychotropic medication use (all p's > .05). Findings tentatively suggest that inpatients with AN/atypical AN and premorbid overweight/obesity gain less weight in the 12-months post hospitalization, despite similar illness severity indicators.

Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we studied the relationship between echocardiographic MG and patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM) following transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve replacement and clinical outcomes.Patients who underwent aortic valve-in-valve replacement with a balloon-expandable valve from July 2015 to December 2023 in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry were included. Adjusted Cox models with regression splines explored the relationship between MG and 5-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier estimates and adjusted hazard ratios compared the occurrence of 5-year mortality between gradient cutoffs and PPM presence.A total of 13 054 patients were included; spline curves demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between discharge MG and 5-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves suggested higher 5-year mortality with MG <10 mm Hg compared with MG ≥10 mm Hg (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.02-1.29]; P=0.024). MG <10 mm Hg was associated with lower ejection fraction compared with higher MG (50.4±13.9 versus 53.2±12.8; P<0.0001).

41661399,2026-02-10,Precision imaging and evolving therapies in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas: from molecular diagnostics to imaging-guided management.,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors originating from neural crest-derived chromaffin tissue, marked by clinical heterogeneity and substantial genetic underpinnings. With up to 70% of cases linked to germline or somatic mutations, including Succinate DeHydrogenase genetic alterations (SDHx), and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), genetic profiling is central to diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutic planning. Clinical presentation varies by tumor location and secretory status-from catecholamine-driven crises to mass effect in head and neck paragangliomas (H&N PGLs). The diagnostic workflow begins with biochemical testing, followed by high-resolution anatomical and functional imaging. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain essential for localization and staging, while radiopharmaceuticals such as ⁶⁸Ga-DOTA⁰-Tyr³-octreotate (⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE), ¹⁸F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (¹⁸F-FDOPA), and ¹³¹I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (¹³¹I-MIBG) refine tumor characterization and guide peptide receptor radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) with radiolabeled octreotide derivatives or therapeutic MIBG Imaging features such as size, necrosis, and diffusion restriction correlate with malignancy risk, but novel molecular imaging offer promise for more precise prognostication. Therapeutic options span from curative surgery to systemic therapies, including temozolomide, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and nuclide therapy. Minimally invasive, image-guided interventions provide palliation for metastatic or inoperable disease. Importantly, artificial intelligence and molecular assays such as the NETest and ¹H-MRS are emerging as pivotal tools in real-time tumor monitoring, early relapse detection, and biomarker discovery. This review underscores the necessity of a multidisciplinary, genomics-informed, and imaging-guided approach to PPGL management. With the integration of advanced imaging and AI-driven analytics, precision oncology for PPGLs is transitioning from potential to practice. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This article offers an overview of the diverse manifestations of paragangliomas, illustrated with examples from various anatomical locations. It also highlights different patterns of tumor evolution and provides an up-to-date review of current management and therapeutic strategies, with a special focus on emerging AI-guided approaches. KEY POINTS: Review the genetic associations, including Von Hippel-Lindau, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Neurofibromatosis, and Carney Triad. Overview of anatomical imaging features (CT and MRI) of paragangliomas. Improve knowledge about the different Nuclear Medicine and functional imaging techniques in detecting lesions, depending on their location, secretory function and underlying genetic mutation.

The primary endpoint, complete response (CR) rate, was 64.7% (52.2, 75.9) for BV/Nivo and 70.3% (57.6, 81.1) for BV/Ipi/Nivo (one-sided p=0.29). The median survival follow-up is 38.0 months (interquartile range 32.6-48.1). Progression-free survival (PFS) did not significantly differ between the two arms (HR=0.78, CI 0.39-1.57, one-sided p=0.24). Treatment-related grade 3+ toxicities in the adult cohort, excluding rash, was similar between both arms (38.5% BV/Nivo and 39.3% BV/Ipi/Nivo); there was higher frequency of grade 3 rash with BV/Ipi/Nivo (24.6%) compared to BV/Nivo (9.2%). We compared PFS by stem cell transplantation (SCT) status in a planned post-hoc comparison; 58 patients received SCT; 36-month PFS (from SCT) was greater than 90% for both arms. Sixty-six patients were alive and progression free after the first scan (disease evaluation) and did not undergo SCT. The 36-month PFS (from first scan) was 73.0% (54.5, 85.0) for BV/Ipi/Nivo compared to 45.8% (26.3, 63.4) for BV/Nivo (HR=0.45, CI 0.19-1.08, one-sided p=0.03).

Although the National Residency Match Program provides data on attributes of successfully matching applicants, it does not provide detailed characteristics of applicants' research portfolio. This single-program retrospective analysis aims to characterize granular aspects of applicant research experiences to determine whether research involvement is linked to higher odds of matching.Applications from interviewed United States allopathic (US-MD) and osteopathic (US-DO) applicants at a single anesthesiology residency program were analyzed for research experience. The primary outcome assessed was the association of any research experience with odds of ranked-to-match and the association of specific types of research experience with ranked-to-match. Secondary outcomes included the association of medical degree type (US-MD vs US-DO) or affiliation of medical school with an anesthesiology residency program to the number of research experiences, and the association of research experiences with the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 score type (Pass/Fail vs Scored).Applicants with at least one research experience were more likely to be ranked-to-match than applicants without research experience (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.55-3.02], P <.001). Similar odds were demonstrated for applicants with at least one peer-reviewed publication compared to no peer-reviewed publications (OR: 2.25, 95% CI, [1.79-2.82], P <.001), and at least one anesthesiology-related research experience compared to no anesthesiology-related research experience (OR: 1.76, 95% CI, [1.36-2.26], P <.001. Applicants from US-MD schools were more likely to have research experience than those from US-DO schools (P <.001); applicants from a medical school affiliated with an anesthesiology residency were more likely to have research experience than applicants from unaffiliated medical schools (P <.001); and applicants with Pass/Fail USMLE Step 1 examinations were more likely than their Scored counterparts to report at least one research experience (P <.001).Applicant research is associated with greater odds of being ranked-to-match in anesthesiology residency. Applicants from US-MD schools and schools affiliated with anesthesiology residency programs have significantly greater rates of reporting at least one research experience. There is a trend toward a higher incidence of reporting at least one research experience with the change of USMLE Step 1 policy toward a Pass/Fail examination.Copyright © 2026 International Anesthesia Research Society.",Anesthesia and analgesia,"Feb 09, 2026",2026.0,Feb,9.0,Jordan Holloway|Briana Kossbiel|Yue Yu|Marilly Palettas|David Stahl|Amy Baumann|Michael Essandoh|Ryan D'Souza|Nasir Hussain,Ryan D'Souza,"From the Department of Anesthesiology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.|Department of Anesthesiology, Center for Biostatistics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.|Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Jordan Holloway, Briana Kossbiel, Yue Yu, Marilly Palettas, David Stahl, Amy Baumann, Michael Essandoh, Ryan D'Souza, Nasir Hussain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41662701/,"The anesthesiology residency application process has undergone significant changes in recent years, prompting the need to understand the role of applicant research experience.

Information related to the patient and family characteristics, presentation, prior history and outcomes was manually extracted by two independent researchers. Patients were excluded if the index visit note could not be located, the patient had no suicidal ideation, attempts, intent or plan, was older than 12 years 11 months at the index date, less than 2 years old or was a duplicate entry.The average annual population was 28,035 children, of which 637 presented with STBs (mean (SD) age, 10.6 (1.7) years; 51.2% girls, 76.3% White, average follow-up 7 years). The majority of the cases presented to the emergency department (ED) 491 (77.1%). The annual incidence per 100,000 person-years tripled from 68.8 in 2005 to 208.6 in 2023. Overall, 105 patients (16.5%) presented with a suicidal attempt. There were no cases of death by suicide. A prior psychiatric diagnosis was present in 454 (71.3%). STB events were preceded by a precipitating event in 471 (73.9%), the most common of which was an argument with a parent, followed by a bullying event and family distress. A specific suicide plan was reported by 328 (51.5%) with laceration reported most frequently, followed by hanging and overdose. Significant predictors of a suicide attempt were previous use of mood stabilisers (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.24 to 7.97) and having a specific plan (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.72 to 4.41). Children who had suicidal attempts had more subsequent ED visits (3.50 vs 2.58; p=0.009) and hospitalisations for psychiatric reasons (1.90 vs 1.30; p=0.003) and psychiatric hospitalisation days (12.70 vs 9.04; p=0.048). Subsequent suicide attempts occurred in 31% of the cohort during follow-up.STBs in preadolescent children are rare but are increasing in incidence. Such children have significant psychological diagnoses, use of mental health services, and subsequent suicide attempts.

41663748,2026-02-10,Clinical practice of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in robotic liver surgery - a global expert survey.,"Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is increasingly incorporated into robotic liver resections (RLR), yet clinical practice regarding timing, dosage, and staining techniques is divergent. This international expert survey aimed to characterize current practices for ICG in RLR.Experts in RLR were invited to participate based on surgical volume (experience of ≥ 50 RLR and ≥ 30 annual RLR). A 74-item questionnaire was developed following a literature search and reviewed by a steering committee. The survey addressed indications, timing, dosage, imaging technology, benefits, limitations, training, and future directions of ICG use. Responses collected between September and October 2025 were analyzed.Seventy experts from 19 countries completed the survey, corresponding to an 88% response rate. Centers performed a median of 180 annual liver resections, including 55 RLR. Most experts used ICG (96%) during RLR. Anatomical demarcation (91%), tumor localization (60%), and biliary anatomy assessment (60%) were the most frequent indications. 60% of experts use preoperative ICG, while intraoperative ICG is mainly administered for demarcation (67%) and biliary tract visualization (40%). Considerable heterogeneity exists in dosage, timing, and staining techniques, particularly in cirrhotic livers and for tumor localization. 53% of the experts had standard operating procedures, whereas 64% expressed the need for a higher degree of standardization. Reported benefits of ICG use included improved anatomical orientation, margin assessment, lesion detection, and support during complex resections. Perceived limitations included background fluorescence, tissue penetration and variable staining in diseased parenchyma. 80% anticipated improved outcomes with combined ICG and three-dimensional image-guidance.ICG fluorescence is widely used in RLR and is an important cornerstone for precision-guided robotic liver surgery. Standardized clinical practice guidelines, structured training, and technological improvements in imaging and navigation systems are claimed to optimize its clinical use.© 2026.

41665050,2026-02-11,Medicolegal Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies for Ultrasound-Guided Nerve Blocks in Emergency Medicine: A Risk-Focused Analysis.,"Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks (USGNBs) are increasingly used in the emergency department (ED) as a safe and effective part of multimodal pain management. Their use has been shown to reduce reliance on opioids and procedural sedation, improve pain scores, and enhance functional outcomes for patients. Additionally, USGNBs in the ED have a complication rate of 0.4%, markedly lower than procedural sedation (4-11%), and they significantly reduce opioid requirements, which is critical considering the current opioid epidemic and the risks of persistent opioid use and overdose. Despite these benefits, relevant concerns about medicolegal liability, informed consent, evolving standards of care, may still influence the adoption of USGNBs in clinical practice. To address these issues, this review examines the legal risks associated with USGNBs by drawing on current clinical literature, closed claims data, and case law. We highlight common adverse events such as peripheral nerve injury and local anesthetic systemic toxicity and assess their legal implications. Potential legal risk including liability related to alternatives like opioid use and procedural sedation, are discussed. While the risk of litigation remains low when best practices are followed, failing to offer a USGNB when clearly indicated may increasingly be viewed as a liability if preventable complications occur. This article aims to provide a practical, interdisciplinary framework, including legal risk assessment, training, credentialing, and risk mitigation, to help clinicians, educators, and hospital administrators safely and confidently integrate USGNBs into ED practice.© 2026 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.",J Ultrasound Med,"Feb 10, 2026",2026.0,Feb,10.0,Blake N Shultz|Rachel A Lindor|Andrew Goldsmith|Arun Nagdev|Erik M Anderson|Graciela Maldonado|Arjun Balakumar|David A Peak|Hamid Shokoohi,Rachel A Lindor|Graciela Maldonado,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Lahey Hospital, UMass Chan - Lahey School of Medicine, Burlington, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Highland Hospital, Alameda Health System, Oakland, California, USA.|University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, Austin, Minnesota, USA.","Blake N Shultz, Rachel A Lindor, Andrew Goldsmith, Arun Nagdev, Erik M Anderson, Graciela Maldonado, Arjun Balakumar, David A Peak, Hamid Shokoohi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41665050/,"Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks (USGNBs) are increasingly used in emergency departments to manage pain effectively and reduce opioid use.

Both are operationally challenging in clinical practice. We developed and validated Colon-Pilot, a large language model (LLM)--powered clinical decision support system (CDSS) using GPT-4o to automate and standardize both functions.The system was evaluated in two operational modes: (1) a human-in-the-loop clinical decision support validation of surveillance recommendations for 596 colonoscopies, comparing concordance with 2020 USMSTF guidelines against expert consensus; and (2) an automated administrative audit applying Colon-Pilot to 42,632 colonoscopies across the Mayo Clinic Health System to calculate 2024 ACG/ASGE priority quality indicators. Recommendations were auto-generated unless predefined safety criteria triggered manual review.Colon-Pilot issued recommendations for 522/596 cases (87.6%) and flagged 12.4% for manual review. For automated cases, guideline-concordant accuracy was 97.5% (Cohen's κ = 0.970) versus 69.7% (κ = 0.781) for original endoscopist recommendations. Discordant AI cases (n=13) most often recommended longer-than-appropriate intervals (62%).

41667782,2026-02-11,Assessments of social vulnerability on central nervous system cancer disparities in the United States.,"Prior investigations of the impact of social determinants of health (SDH) on people with primary central nervous system cancers (PCNSC) have considered limited SDH-factors and pathologies. This study examines how the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) influences disparities in outcome for people with PCNSC across the United States (US).This population-based retrospective cohort study assessed adults with PCNSC between 1975-2017 from the Surveillance-Epidemiology-End Results database, categorized using the Central Brain-Tumor-Registry of the US (CBTRUS) classifications. SDH-vulnerability/SVI scores were assigned to patients' county-of-residence based on 15 SDH-factors of socioeconomic status (SES), proportions using a minority language (ML), household composition (HC), and infrastructure/housing-transportation (HT) characteristics, plus an overall composite of these four themes. Survival and logistic regressions were obtained for survival period and multimodal treatment receipt across all PCNSC-patients based on their SVI-scores/SDH-vulnerability.Across 116,373 PCNSC-patients (64,841 [55.7%] male; 92,476 [79.5%] non-Hispanic white race-ethnicity), increasing overall SDH-vulnerability is associated with relative mean survival period decreases between 22.12%-45.81% across 8/8 CBTRUS-classes, with the largest-magnitude effects among HC, HT, and SES-vulnerabilities. There are decreased odds of external beam radiation for 4/8 CBTRUS-classes (lowest-embryonal: OR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.80-0.96) and surgery for 3/8 CBTRUS classes (lowest-oligodendroglial: OR 0.96; 95%CI 0.95-0.97). The largest-magnitude effects are among those using ML, followed by impact of HC and HT characteristics.SDH-vulnerability associates with worse survival and treatment effects for PCNSC patients. Some specific SDH more strongly influence disparity associations, so resources could be focused more on reducing these disparity drivers.© 2026.

41665234,2026-02-11,Artificial Intelligence for Gastroenterology Practice: A Modified Delphi Consensus.,"The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) assembled a multidisciplinary task force to evaluate the current state and future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) in gastroenterology, hepatology, and endoscopy leading to the development of consensus-based recommendations for responsible AI integration in clinical practice.A total of 32 subject-matter experts and 12 industry partners, representing diverse practice settings and expertise, conducted subgroup literature reviews across five key areas (endoscopy, practice management clinical applications, training and education, IBD and liver disease, ethics and equity). Draft statements were developed and rated on a 5-point Likert scale using a modified Delphi process. A consensus was set at ≥70% combined agreement. Non-consensus items were revised and re-voted electronically.A total of 43 statements, 40 (93%) reached consensus in round 1 and the remaining 3 achieved consensus after round 2. Evidence supports computer-aided detection (CADe) improving adenoma detection rate and miss rate in controlled studies, with mixed ""real-world"" impact and insufficient long-term outcomes (e.g., interval colon cancer rate). Recommendations emphasize thorough validation and reduction of bias via heterogeneous datasets. Outside endoscopy, ambient AI scribes, NLP-enabled coding, workflow optimization, and prior authorization support show potential. Training recommendations endorse a structured AI curriculum while preserving independent procedural competence to avoid ""deskilling"". In IBD and hepatology, AI could help improve diagnostic accuracy, help predict risk for disease progression, and help guide therapy. Equity, governance, and reimbursement statements call for chain-of-custody data protections, specialty-society oversight, and payment models that reward quality and cost reduction.This consensus outlines how AI can augment rather than replace clinical expertise while promoting safety, transparency, interoperability, and equity. Priorities include pragmatic and prospective trials, multi-institutional data-sharing consortia, bias mitigation, and workforce training to enable trustworthy and clinically impactful AI adoption in GI, liver, and endoscopy care.Copyright © 2026 by The American College of Gastroenterology.",The American journal of gastroenterology,"Feb 10, 2026",2026.0,Feb,10.0,Seth A Gross|Aasma Shaukat|Anita Afzali|Joseph C Ahn|Jasmohan S Bajaj|Jodie A Barkin|Mohammad Bilal|Saurabh Chawla|Nayantara Coelho-Prabhu|Sarah M Enslin|Andrew D Feld|Harish K Gagneja|David J Hass|Yasmin G Hernandez-Barco|Sara N Horst|Brian C Jacobson|Patricia D Jones|Vivek Kaul|Vladimir M Kushnir|Cadman L Leggett|Galen Leung|Miguel Mascarenhas|Sravanthi Parasa|Nasim Parsa|Jason N Schairer|Eric D Shah|Douglas A Simonetto|Brennan Spiegel|Ryan W Stidham|Praveen Suthrum|Sapna Thomas|Meridith E Phillips,Joseph C Ahn|Nayantara Coelho-Prabhu|Sarah M Enslin|Vivek Kaul|Cadman L Leggett|Douglas A Simonetto,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minneapolis, USA.|Virginia Commonwealth University and Richmond VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.|Division of Digestive Health and Liver Diseases, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.|Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Kaiser Permanente Washington State, Seattle, Washington, USA.|Austin Gastroenterology, PA, Austin, Texas, USA.|Division of Digestive Diseases, Yale New Haven Health and PACT Gastroenterology Center, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Washington in University St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Gastroenterology Department, Hospital São João, Porto, Portugal.|Department of Gastroenterology, Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Minnesota/Satisfai Health, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, USA.|Department of Gastroenterology, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.|Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.|Division of Health Services Research, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, USA.|NextServices, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.|University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.|American College of Gastroenterology, North Bethesda, Maryland, USA.","Seth A Gross, Aasma Shaukat, Anita Afzali, Joseph C Ahn, Jasmohan S Bajaj, Jodie A Barkin, Mohammad Bilal, Saurabh Chawla, Nayantara Coelho-Prabhu, Sarah M Enslin, Andrew D Feld, Harish K Gagneja, David J Hass, Yasmin G Hernandez-Barco, Sara N Horst, Brian C Jacobson, Patricia D Jones, Vivek Kaul, Vladimir M Kushnir, Cadman L Leggett, Galen Leung, Miguel Mascarenhas, Sravanthi Parasa, Nasim Parsa, Jason N Schairer, Eric D Shah, Douglas A Simonetto, Brennan Spiegel, Ryan W Stidham, Praveen Suthrum, Sapna Thomas, Meridith E Phillips",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41665234/,"The American College of Gastroenterology assembled a multidisciplinary task force to evaluate the current state and future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) in gastroenterology, hepatology, and endoscopy.

41666265,2026-02-11,Dynamic feedback control of oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in acute leukemia.,"CD25 is a subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Acute leukemias with oncogenic tyrosine kinases often include CD25+ leukemia subpopulations, which portend poor clinical outcomes for patients; however, acute leukemia cells do not respond to IL-2. Here, we identified CD25 and its phosphorylation by protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as central elements of a feedback loop that stabilized fluctuations in oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia. Genetic ablation of CD25 in murine and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukemias reduced clonal fitness, colony formation, and leukemia-initiation capacity in serial transplant recipients. Oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in leukemia cells stimulated NF-κB-mediated CD25 expression, whereas PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of CD25 suppressed oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling through inhibitory phosphatases, such as PTPN6. Interactome analyses and mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomic analyses showed that CD25 deletion abolished the phosphatase activity of PTPN6, resulting in enhanced activation of tyrosine kinases and NF-κB. Four injections of a CD25 antibody-drug conjugate induced complete remission in mice transplanted with PDX refractory leukemia.

41666566,2026-02-11,EEG foundation models: A critical review of current progress and future directions.,"Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear.In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs.We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps.We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Journal of neural engineering,"Feb 10, 2026",2026.0,Feb,10.0,Gayal Kuruppu|Neeraj Wagh|Vaclav Kremen|Yogatheesan Varatharajah,Vaclav Kremen,"Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, 200, Union St SE, Minneapolis, 55455, United States.|Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1406 W Green St, Urbana, Illinois, 61801-3028, United States.|Bioelectronics Neurophysiology and Engineering Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905-0002, United States.|Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, 200 Union St SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States.","Gayal Kuruppu, Neeraj Wagh, Vaclav Kremen, Yogatheesan Varatharajah",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41666566/,"Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of brain activity offer valuable insights for scientific and clinical research.

41667230,2026-02-11,Associations of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Metrics with Structural and Cerebrovascular Disease Imaging Metrics in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus symptoms can be alleviated through shunt placement. However, the identification of suitable patients is often challenging despite several existing biomarkers. DTI is commonly used to assess white matter integrity, with DTI analysis along the perivascular space being a recently described, though less extensively evaluated metric. It has been proposed to monitor glymphatic (glial-lymphatic) activity in the brain, the impairment of which may play a role in several neurologic diseases. The goal of this study is to evaluate the association of DTI along the perivascular space with other diffusion and structural imaging metrics among patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls to provide insight into the etiology of disease-related changes in the DTI along the perivascular space metric and the utility of this metric in disease diagnosis.This study retrospectively identified 43 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients and 86 sex and age matched controls. We compared the DTI along the perivascular space index, fractional anisotropy, ventricular volume, total intracranial volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, and perivascular space load between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and controls and evaluated the association of the DTI along the perivascular space index and other imaging metrics within each diagnostic group.We found that the DTI analysis along the perivascular space index and fractional anisotropy were significantly lower and ventricular volume, total intracranial volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, and perivascular space load were significantly higher in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients compared to controls. The ventricular volume, total intracranial volume, and white matter hyperintensity volume were correlated with the DTI analysis along the perivascular space index in the controls but not the patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.A lower DTI analysis along the perivascular space index in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients may be indicative of morphological disease-related changes. The limited correlations with other imaging metrics suggest that the index is an independent or additive metric compared to existing structural or cerebrovascular disease markers of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.DTI-ALPS = diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space; iNPH = idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; (C)DESH = (computation) disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus; PVS = perivascular space; WMH = white matter hyperintensity; FA = fractional anisotropy; GCC = genus of corpus callosum; AUROC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

PET imaging provides the opportunity to visualize amyloid and tau aggregates and in vivo neurodegenerative changes. These techniques provide exciting new avenues toward diagnosis, disease staging, and therapeutic monitoring of AD. Methods: This review details recent advances in amyloid PET, tau PET, and 18F-FDG PET as they relate to the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of AD. The increasing roles of PET in the biologically based diagnosis of AD and antiamyloid immunotherapy response monitoring are addressed. Results: Amyloid PET enables improved detection of amyloid-β plaques within the brain. Amyloid PET is increasingly vital for confirming AD diagnoses given the emergence of antiamyloid immunotherapies, which require biomarker-verified amyloid positivity to initiate treatment. Tau PET provides a direct measure of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and is useful for disease staging, the interpretation of atypical clinical presentations, and treatment decision-making. 18F-FDG PET plays a vital role in distinguishing AD from other dementia subtypes. Expanded reimbursement policies for amyloid and tau PET have increased accessibility to these modalities. Finally, quantitative methods facilitate interscan reproducibility and permit therapeutic monitoring. Conclusion: Molecular neuroimaging is poised to play a central role in the biologic definition, diagnosis, staging, and management of AD.

41667776,2026-02-11,Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events and VTE in Patients with IBD Taking Anti-TNF versus JAK Inhibitors: A Multicenter Cohort Analysis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are approved to treat IBD, but there are concerns over whether they increase the risk of MACE or venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with IBD. We aimed to compare the incidence risk of MACE and VTE in patients with IBD treated with JAKi agents versus anti-TNFs.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database to identify patients  ≥ 18 years with IBD and treated with JAKi or anti-TNF therapy. Patients in the JAKi cohort were matched with patients treated with anti-TNF by using 1:1 propensity score matching. Patients with a history of a prior cardiovascular event were excluded from the analysis. Co-primary outcomes were MACE and VTE within 1-year after medication initiation. Additional subgroup analyses were performed based on age, sex, and IBD type. Kaplan-Meier analysis with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to compare time-to-event rates.In total, there were 8942 patients in the JAKi cohort matched with 8942 patients in the anti-TNF cohort. There was no difference between the two cohorts in the development of MACE (aHR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.87-1.33; p = 0.49) or VTE (aHR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.84-1.36; p = 0.61). In patients aged ≥ 65 years, there was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in MACE outcomes (aHR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.69-1.31; p = 0.75). Consistent findings were observed when comparing ulcerative colitis to Crohn's disease, upadacitinib to tofacitinib, or JAKi to infliximab.Our results suggest that patients with IBD, including patients ≥ 65 years, who are treated with JAKi, were not at increased risk of MACE or VTE over a 12-month period as compared to those treated with anti-TNF therapy. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.© 2026.

41671520,2026-02-12,A Roadmap to Neurologic Health Equity: An AAN Position Statement.,"Neurologic disorders affect more than 200 million people in the United States, yet inequities in neurologic health persist particularly among marginalized populations. These disparities are rooted not in biological differences but in inequitable social, economic, and structural conditions and result in disproportionate disease burden, delayed diagnoses, restricted access to specialty care, and subpar brain health outcomes for populations experiencing health disparities (HDPs). Existing national health equity frameworks from the NIH demonstrate that neurologic inequities are shaped by intersecting social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural barriers that limit fair and just opportunities to achieve optimal brain health. In response, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) proposes a comprehensive Roadmap to Neurologic Health Equity, grounded in the principle that every individual should have the opportunity to attain their highest level of brain health. The AAN roadmap provides a coordinated strategy to address health inequity across 4 domains: (1) Clinical Practice and Quality, (2) Scientific Knowledge and Research, (3) Education and Awareness, and (4) Advocacy. For clinical practice, the roadmap emphasizes integrating SDOH into clinical care delivery, expanding language services and culturally responsive models, and advancing workforce diversity to better reflect and serve diverse communities. Research priorities include strengthening rigor in disparities research, increasing participation of HDPs in clinical studies, and expanding training pathways for investigators committed to health equity. Educational initiatives focus on embedding health equity content throughout neurology curricula, enhancing clinician awareness of health disparities through AAN programming, and strengthening communication skills necessary for effective community engagement. The policy and advocacy framework targets systemic reforms such as expanding insurance coverage, improving reimbursement for complex neurologic care, investing in telehealth infrastructure, and addressing the national neurology workforce shortage through increased Graduate Medical Education funding and secure immigration pathways for international neurologists willing to serve in underserved areas. Together, these strategies provide a unified, actionable approach to advancing brain health equity across the lifespan. The AAN calls upon clinicians, researchers, educators, policymakers, and community advocates to join in implementing this roadmap and ensuring that the pursuit of optimal brain health is attainable and equitable for all.",Neurology,"Mar 10, 2026",2026.0,Mar,10.0,Payal B Patel|Roy H Hamilton|Joshua A Budhu|Samir R Belagaje|Gregory E Cooper|Franklyn Rocha Cabrero|Anindita Deb|Veronica E Santini|Rashmi Halker|Tiffany L Fisher|Charles C Flippen|Eseosa Ighodaro|Nicole Rosendale|Vijay K Ramanan|Kiran T Thakur|Nimish A Mohile,Rashmi Halker|Vijay K Ramanan|Nimish A Mohile,"Department of Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle.|Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.|Neuro-oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.|Department of Neurology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.|Department of Neurology, Norton Neuroscience Institute, Louisville, KY.|CEO, IRD Neuroanalysis Inc, Los Angeles, CA.|Department of Neurology, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester.|Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis.|Department of Neurology, UCLA Health, Los Angeles, CA.|Department of Neurology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC.|Department of Neurology, University of California San Franscico.|Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irvine Medical Center, New York, NY; and.|Department of Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY.","Payal B Patel, Roy H Hamilton, Joshua A Budhu, Samir R Belagaje, Gregory E Cooper, Franklyn Rocha Cabrero, Anindita Deb, Veronica E Santini, Rashmi Halker, Tiffany L Fisher, Charles C Flippen, Eseosa Ighodaro, Nicole Rosendale, Vijay K Ramanan, Kiran T Thakur, Nimish A Mohile",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41671520/,"Neurologic disorders affect millions of people in the United States, but inequities in neurologic health persist, particularly among marginalized populations.

These include early graft shrinkage, extrusion, reoperation due to reoccurrence of pain or mechanical symptoms and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this review is to evaluate the influence of MAT surgical techniques, and novel cell therapies on graft extrusion and tibial femoral contact stresses and how these can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes.Of the 27 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 (clinical and cadaveric) focused on the impact of surgical fixation techniques on extrusion, joint loading mechanics and clinical outcomes. These studies demonstrated that bony fixation techniques were superior to soft tissue and transossesous suture fixation for restoring joint mechanics and minimizing extrusion. However, clinical outcomes were not significantly impacted by these biomechanical findings. The remaining 11 studies investigated novel cell therapies for meniscus regeneration and improving MAT procedures. Intrameniscal injections into frozen meniscus allografts demonstrated the potential for cell therapy to improve allograft tissue properties. Intraarticular injections and cell sheet transplantation led to tissue regeneration and chondroprotection following a hemi-meniscectomy in preclinical models. Although short-term clinical outcomes and PROMs are not significantly affected by fixation techniques, cadaveric and clinical studies have suggested that suture-only fixation with a traditional transosseous fixation may lead to worsened extrusion and joint mechanics compared to bony fixation methods. However, the implications of these findings on long-term clinical outcomes have not been evaluated. Cell therapy could further improve allograft tissue properties, chondroprotection and graft healing working together with current surgical techniques to restore joint functioning.© 2026.

41673229,2026-02-12,State and Diffusion of National Institutes of Health Funding of AI in Radiology.,"Artificial intelligence research has profound implications for the future of radiology, making it essential to understand funding patterns and diffusion rate from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), historically the leading source of biomedical research funding in the United States. Recent changes in federal funding further necessitate understanding the trends and focus areas for future comparison and strategic decisions by researchers, institutions, and policymakers adapting to the evolving funding landscape. This retrospective study searched and analyzed active NIH-funded projects as of January 2025 and temporally over the last decade (2015-2024) using the NIH RePORTER and ExPORTER databases. An automated large language model pipeline was employed for thematic extraction and categorization of active projects. Diffusion rate analyses were performed to examine the progression of funding distribution across institutes. Descriptive statistics were provided for grant types, administering institutes, principal investigator details, organizations, geography, and research topics. Among active grants focused on AI in radiology, the National Cancer Institute led in total projects (188; $117.0 M), while the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute had the greatest funding ($167.3 M). The most common grant type for AI in radiology was R01 (547 projects; $326.1 M), followed by R21 (85 projects; $24.2 M) and U01 (51 projects; $65.6 M). Funding was concentrated in major academic institutions. Over the years, annual funding grew approximately 13.7-fold from $46.4 M (FY2015) to $633.5 M (FY2024), and integration of AI projects into radiology research increased approximately eightfold (from 3.9% to 30.4%). AI diffusion demonstrated exponential growth (Compound Annual Growth Rate, CAGR 25.5%, R2 = 0.97) with a doubling time of 2.94 years. At 30.4% penetration, the field has entered the Early Majority phase, approaching a critical 50% inflection point projected for 2028-2030.

While non-contrast computed tomography scans hold promise for opportunistic detection of steatotic liver disease, their potential for staging and risk assessment remains underexplored. Here we present a multimodal AI model trained on a large dataset, comprising of (n=968) histopathologically and (n=1103) radiologically confirmed cases, validated against both histology (n=660) and MRI-PDFF (n=375) gold standards, demonstrating high accuracy in detecting mild to severe steatosis (AUC: 0.904-0.929) and clinically significant fibrosis (AUC: 0.824-0.888). Furthermore, integrating the model into the standard clinical pathway improves primary risk screening in a retrospective patient cohort (n=1192), identifying 36% more patients at risk of fibrosis progression. Using Cox proportional hazard model, we observe that the intermediate-high risk patients identified by the optimized clinical pathway exhibits a significantly higher incidence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio: 5.54: 2.69-11.42), showcasing the model's potential for early detection and management of steatotic liver disease.© 2026.

41671406,2026-02-12,Management of patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection: A real-world economic evaluation from the hospital perspective.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to impact global health, particularly among high-risk vulnerable individuals. With the loss of federal funding for SARS-CoV-2 management, hospitals will need to budget appropriately for antivirals like remdesivir, which has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing mortality. We evaluated the economic impact realized by hospitals for patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and initiated on remdesivir therapy.We conducted a retrospective analysis using data compiled in the Premier Healthcare Database from January 2023 to February 2024. Propensity score matching was used to compare remdesivir-treated (RDV) and untreated (No RDV) groups. The mortality rate, hazard ratios associated with remdesivir use, and hospitalization costs were assessed overall and among the elderly (age ≥65 years). We also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the economic value of remdesivir treatment.Among 25,498 hospitalized patients, the mortality rate in the RDV group was lower than in the No RDV group (6.2% vs 8.1), with a greater reduction in the elderly (6.9% vs 9.0%). Remdesivir significantly reduced mortality risk by approximately 25% overall and among the elderly. Each life saved was realized at a minimal increase in average hospitalization costs ($18,329 in the RDV group vs $14,845 in the No RDV group). Remdesivir was a cost-effective treatment option at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $25,000 overall and among the elderly.Our evaluation provides contemporaneous evidence of benefits and costs associated with management of individuals hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initiation of remdesivir was associated with minimal incremental hospitalization costs for lives saved as compared to not initiating remdesivir. Hospital pharmacy leadership can utilize this real-world evidence to appropriately budget for remdesivir treatment.© The Author(s) 2026.

Here we evaluate the impact of VCAN on immune surveillance and immunotherapy response in a prospective clinical trial.T cell function was assayed in the setting of VCAN. Normal and matched tissues were acquired from 243 patients across CRC stages. A phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 15 subjects with microsatellite stable oligometastatic CRC and examined the safety/efficacy of the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), pembrolizumab, and resection (NCT02837263). The outcomes were correlated with the VCAN status and circulating immune phenotype by scRNAseq.VCAN significantly accumulates in 59% of CRCs and heavily proteolyzed (VCAN proteolytic predominant (VPP)) in 27% (40% of oligometastatic CRCs). VCAN decreased CD8+ T cell trafficking (p<0.01) and activated CD8+ T cell effector function (decreased IL2RA (p<0.05), PD1 (<0.05) and GZMB (p<0.001)). The clinical trial met the primary endpoint with a 1-year recurrence free survival of 60%. Of those enrolled, 40% had the VPP phenotype, which was associated with a trend towards improved RFS (p=0.053), and all are still alive with a median follow-up of 4.1 years. The VPP phenotype was associated with enhanced circulating CD8+ T cell effector function at baseline, which was enhanced with study treatment.VCAN limits T cell trafficking and effector function and its proteolysis correlates with an effector phenotype of circulating CD8+ T cells, greater tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and improved clinical outcomes with this immunotherapy-based clinical trial treatment.",Clin Cancer Res,"Feb 11, 2026",2026.0,Feb,11.0,Dustin A Deming|Sean G Kraus|Joshua Brand|Katherine A Johnson|Daniel Abbott|Jeremy Kratz|Anita A Turk|Philip Emmerich|Evie Carchman|Sam J Lubner|Noelle K LoConte|Nataliya V Uboha|Somak Chaudhuri|Ruchi Shah|Anna Field|Elizabeth Field|Cheri A Pasch|David H Kim|Sharon Weber|Charles Heise|Elise Lawson|Cristina Sanger|Kristina Matkowskyj|Fotis Asimakopoulos|Jens Eickhoff|Huy Q Dinh|Michael F Bassetti,Kristina Matkowskyj,"University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison, WI United States.|University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison United States.|University of Wisconsin-Madison United States.|UW Carbone Cancer Center Madison United States.|UW Carbone Cancer Center Madison, WI United States.|University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison, Wisconsin United States.|Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN United States.|Rush University Medical Center United States.","Dustin A Deming, Sean G Kraus, Joshua Brand, Katherine A Johnson, Daniel Abbott, Jeremy Kratz, Anita A Turk, Philip Emmerich, Evie Carchman, Sam J Lubner, Noelle K LoConte, Nataliya V Uboha, Somak Chaudhuri, Ruchi Shah, Anna Field, Elizabeth Field, Cheri A Pasch, David H Kim, Sharon Weber, Charles Heise, Elise Lawson, Cristina Sanger, Kristina Matkowskyj, Fotis Asimakopoulos, Jens Eickhoff, Huy Q Dinh, Michael F Bassetti",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41671077/,"Colorectal cancer is a major health concern, and understanding how the tumor microenvironment affects the immune response is crucial for improving treatment.

41670901,2026-02-12,Women Are Slightly More Sexually Satisfied in Their Romantic Relationships Than Men: An Integrative Data Analytic Approach.,"Sexual satisfaction is a common goal within romantic relationships that contributes to individual and relational well-being. Yet, theoretical perspectives, and even popular assumptions, suggest that women may be less sexually satisfied than men. We tested this possibility among people in romantic relationships with two high-powered Integrative Data Analyses (one cross-sectional, n = 11,841, k = 28; one daily-experience, n = 1,827, k = 8, daily reports = 18,321). Contrary to theoretical and lay perspectives, partnered women reported slightly greater sexual satisfaction than did partnered men (r = .08).. To further explore why partnered women reported greater sexual satisfaction than did partnered men, we conducted supplemental analyses that revealed that women's greater sexual satisfaction was not a result of engaging in less frequent sexual behavior, their broader satisfaction with their relationship, or considering partners' sexual enjoyment. In sum, although women may face obstacles that hinder their sexual experiences, these findings suggest that partnered women do not report being less satisfied and instead report being slightly more satisfied with their sex lives than do partnered men. Nevertheless, it is still unknown whether these slight differences in sexual satisfaction have practical implications for couples' relationships or well-being.© 2026.

Tumor size and volume were classified with respect to EOR and subgroup and there was no statistically signifcant difference noted. There were 5 non-WNT non-SHH subgroup patients who underwent second look surgery. EOR and the location of residual tumor varied, but GTR was achieved in all cases.When indicated, second look surgery is safe and offers an opportunity to achieve GTR.

41670578,2026-02-12,Visual Outcomes of Plasma Exchange for Acute Optic Neuritis: A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.,"To review the published literature on the visual outcomes and the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange (PLEX) for the treatment of acute optic neuritis (ON).Literature searches without date restrictions and limited to studies published in English were conducted last in January 2025 in the PubMed database. The combined searches yielded 207 citations, 39 of which were reviewed in full text. Of these, 12 articles met the criteria for inclusion in this assessment and subsequently were assigned a level of evidence rating by the panel methodologist.Two studies were rated level II, and 10 studies were rated level III. The 2 level II studies showed improved visual outcomes after PLEX for the treatment of acute ON compared with a comparative or historical cohort of patients treated with corticosteroids alone. The other 10 studies did not have a comparative arm (n = 9) or lacked specific visual acuity outcomes (n = 1) and therefore were rated level III. Ten studies included patients with neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorder ON, all of which found some degree of visual recovery after PLEX. In 8 studies that included other causes of ON, most found improvement in vision after PLEX in patients with multiple sclerosis, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease ON, or both, but outcomes for treatment of idiopathic ON were mixed. In the studies that evaluated other causes of ON, most found improvement in vision after PLEX in patients with multiple sclerosis, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease ON, or both, but outcomes for treatment of idiopathic ON were mixed. Factors associated with worse visual outcomes included severe vision loss at the time of PLEX, older age, history of prior ON in the affected eye, and delay in PLEX. Major complications were rare and mostly included issues associated with central line placement.Level II and III evidence suggest that PLEX may be associated with improved visual outcomes in acute ON. Severity of vision loss, older age, prior ON in the affected eye, and delay to PLEX all were associated with less visual recovery. Future randomized clinical trials will be required to confirm level I evidence for the efficacy of PLEX treatment in ON and to help determine the optimal timing for treatment and which patients would be most likely to benefit.The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.Copyright © 2026 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Despite recent advancements in understanding complement 3 glomerulopathy pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. Current treatments often fail to prevent poor outcomes, with 30-50% of adult patients progressing to kidney failure and high rates of disease recurrence following kidney transplantation. Genetic studies have revealed that variants in complement regulators and effectors contribute to disease susceptibility in a subset of patients, although autoantibody-driven mechanisms account for most cases. Encouraging results from recent clinical trials provide hope for improving the overall prognosis of this entity, yet critical knowledge gaps persist. This review explores the heterogeneity of complement 3 glomerulopathy and examines the emerging therapeutic landscape, highlighting advancements in the management of this complex condition.Copyright © 2026 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

41669969,2026-02-12,Cardiogenic Shock Detection Using Electronic Medical Records: A Review and Blueprint for Clinical Implementation and Future Research.,"Despite advances in drug and device technology, health care delivery, and research infrastructure, cardiogenic shock (CS) continues to have nearly 50% in-hospital mortality. In patients with CS, both the initial severity of Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention CS and its subsequent trajectory predicts the clinical outcomes. Accordingly, delayed initial recognition and failure to escalate or deescalate treatment can significantly affect the outcomes of CS. Traditional assessment methods, with the exception of blood pressure measurement, require a high index of suspicion and frequent reassessment by the clinical team. Electronic medical record-based detection has been successfully implemented in acute and critical care patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury. In CS, electronic medical record-based studies have largely focused on using models to predict outcomes in patients with CS, with limited data on electronic medical record-based tools to assist with either predicting CS or providing real time alerts when escalation or de-escalation might be indicated. Early detection of CS may be associated with detection of earlier Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention stages of CS and potentially prevent deterioration to higher stages. In this review, we seek to highlight a blueprint for electronic medical record-based detection of CS that focuses on reproducibility, convenience, clinical decision support, and research aspects.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Feb 11, 2026",2026.0,Feb,11.0,Saraschandra Vallabhajosyula|Chirag Mehta|Atin Jindal|Aryan Mehta|Vishal Khetpal|Jacob C Jentzer|Van-Khue K Ton|Parag C Patel|Srihari S Naidu|Navin K Kapur|J D Abbott,Jacob C Jentzer|Parag C Patel,"Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University Providence RI USA.|Brown University Health Cardiovascular Institute Providence RI USA.|Department of Medicine Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University Providence RI USA.|Division of Hospital Medicine, The Miriam Hospital Brown University Health Providence RI USA.|Department of Medicine University of Connecticut School of Medicine Farmington CT USA.|Division of Critical Care Cardiology, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA.|Division of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Jacksonville FL USA.|Department of Cardiology New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center Valhalla NY USA.|Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine Tufts University School of Medicine Boston MA USA.","Saraschandra Vallabhajosyula, Chirag Mehta, Atin Jindal, Aryan Mehta, Vishal Khetpal, Jacob C Jentzer, Van-Khue K Ton, Parag C Patel, Srihari S Naidu, Navin K Kapur, J D Abbott",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41669969/,"Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a serious medical condition with a high mortality rate, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Probable HFpEF was defined as patient-reported dyspnea with HFpEF-age, body mass index and history of AF probability≥75%. Absence of dyspnea or HFpEF-age, body mass index and history of AF probability<75% was considered to reflect patients without HFpEF. The effect of randomization to catheter ablation on QOL (Mayo Atrial Fibrillation-Specific Symptom Inventory questionnaire and EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level score) was assessed using mixed models.Of participants without known HF, 70% (n=1225) had probable HFpEF and the remaining 30% (n=522) did not. Those with probable HFpEF had worse New York Heart Association class, EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level score, Mayo Atrial Fibrillation-Specific Symptom Inventory severity, and Mayo Atrial Fibrillation-Specific Symptom Inventory frequency scores (P<0.0001 for all), with higher risk of HF hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 2.19 [95% CI, 1.11-4.31], P=0.01). Ablation resulted in greater improvement in EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level and Mayo Atrial Fibrillation-Specific Symptom Inventory severity/frequency scores in probable HFpEF (interactions P=0.005, P=0.05, and P=0.04 respectively). In probable HFpEF, catheter ablation was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.66-0.92], P=0.003, interaction P=0.03) but not HF hospitalization (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.55-1.64], P=0.84).Nearly three quarters of CABANA participants had potentially undiagnosed HFpEF, with worse QOL and risk of HF hospitalization. Catheter ablation in probable HFpEF resulted in greater improvement in QOL, but residual QOL impairment and HF risk remained elevated despite ablation.

40884032,2026-02-12,Vericiguat and mortality in heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: the VICTOR trial.,"In the VICTOR trial (NCT05093933), vericiguat was neutral for the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF). VICTOR was powered to independently assess cardiovascular death. This study reports detailed analysis on the effects of vericiguat on mortality.VICTOR, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, enrolled 6105 ambulatory patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) without recent worsening and randomized them to vericiguat or placebo. The main outcome for this analysis was the pre-specified secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death. All-cause death, sudden cardiac death, and death related to HF were also assessed.Over a median of 19.7 months (inter-quartile range 14.6-25.4), cardiovascular deaths occurred in 292 patients (5.7 deaths per 100 patient-years) and 346 patients (6.8 deaths per 100 patient-years) in the vericiguat and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.97; P = .020). Risk of death from any cause was lower with vericiguat vs placebo (377 [7.3 deaths per 100 patient-years] vs 440 [8.6 deaths per 100 patient-years]; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.97; P = .015). Sudden cardiac death and HF-related deaths were lower with vericiguat vs placebo (1.6 vs 2.2 events per 100 patient-years; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.99; P = .042 and 1.7 vs 2.4 events per 100 patient-years; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94; P = .016, respectively). Lower mortality rates were consistent across subgroups including baseline therapy. Consistent cardiovascular and all-cause mortality benefit was seen across baseline N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels.In ambulatory well-treated participants with HFrEF, vericiguat was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in the key secondary outcome of cardiovascular death, as well as all-cause mortality.© The Author(s) 2025.

Statements were evaluated via structured discussions and voting processes. Those reaching more than 70% consensus were adopted for inclusion. Statements underwent final review and editing by the leadership of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the International Urogynecological Association.Consensus statements addressed referral criteria, diagnostic evaluations, therapy protocols, timing, coordination with surgery, and management of anatomical abnormalities.Fifteen statements reached consensus. Key recommendations included prompt referral to pelvic floor physical therapy for patients without contraindications, individualized therapy based on appropriate diagnostic evaluation and patient goals, timing of pelvic floor physical therapy relative to surgery, and trauma-informed patient care.Recommendations primarily reflect expert consensus due to limited high-quality evidence. Variability in practitioner expertise and geographic access to trained therapists are barriers to consistent implementation.These recommendations provide structured guidance for integrating pelvic floor physical therapy into the management of obstructed defecation syndrome and rectal prolapse.

41678831,2026-02-13,Volume electron microscopy reveals heterogeneity of the hemostatic response in veins and arteries.,"Intravital imaging studies have provided insights into the spatial and temporal variations of platelet activation and thrombin generation that occur during hemostasis, but these studies are generally limited to small vessels due to practical limitations of imaging in thicker tissues. Recent advances in cleared tissue fluorescence imaging as well as volume electron microscopy (vEM) coupled with machine learning-based image segmentation provide an opportunity for analysis of the 3-dimensional structure of complex tissues. We utilized these technologies to examine hemostatic plugs from murine jugular veins and carotid arteries to investigate the spatial distribution of platelet activation and biochemical responses in these disparate physiologic contexts. Both venous and arterial hemostatic plugs had a heterogeneous structure with regions of sparsely and densely packed platelets. Despite similar injury sizes, arterial hemostatic plugs were at least an order of magnitude larger than venous plugs. The difference in plug size was primarily due to a 19-fold increase in the population of densely packed platelets in the extravascular compartment. Venous plugs displayed significant platelet aggregation extending into the vessel lumen and developed distinctive fibrin and red blood cell-filled cavities. Complementary fluorescence microscopy revealed that platelet activation was spatially heterogeneous in both contexts, with a-granule secretion and phosphatidylserine exposure confined to specific microenvironments, highlighting tightly regulated thrombin activity. Overall, our findings reveal both conserved and distinct mechanisms of hemostatic thrombus formation in different physiologic contexts. They also demonstrate the power of vEM coupled with machine-learning based image segmentation for quantitative analysis of large imaging datasets from complex tissues.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Feb 12, 2026",2026.0,Feb,12.0,Maurizio Tomaiuolo|Meghan E Roberts|Jenna R Severa|Christopher D Mansi|Brenna BY Mathers|Anna Mannix|Trace A Christensen|Lawrence F Brass|Talid Sinno|Timothy J Stalker,Trace A Christensen,"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.","Maurizio Tomaiuolo, Meghan E Roberts, Jenna R Severa, Christopher D Mansi, Brenna BY Mathers, Anna Mannix, Trace A Christensen, Lawrence F Brass, Talid Sinno, Timothy J Stalker",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678831/,"This research paper examines the complex structure and dynamics of hemostatic plugs, which are critical for stopping bleeding, in different blood vessels.

The findings reveal striking differences in the size and composition of venous and arterial hemostatic plugs, with arterial plugs being much larger due to a greater accumulation of densely packed platelets outside the vessel. The study provides important insights into the spatial regulation of platelet activation and thrombin generation, which could inform the development of better treatments for bleeding disorders.

Those with recurrences prostate confined might be suitable for salvage focal therapy (sFT) or salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP). sFT may offer good cancer control with comparatively less toxic effects, but outcomes beyond 5 years have not been reported, and no study has compared sFT to sRP.To compare cancer control and perioperative complications among patients after sFT vs sRP.In this international, multicenter cohort study of matched comparison data, patients undergoing sFT were derived from the prospective UK HIFU (high-intensity focused ultrasound) Evaluation and Treatment and International Cryotherapy Evaluation registries (9 centers; 2006-2024) and the prospective UK Focal Recurrent Assessment and Salvage Treatment cohort study (6 centers; 2014-2018). Patients undergoing sRP were derived from an international retrospective registry (12 centers in 8 countries; 2000-2021). Patients with biopsy-confirmed, localized recurrent prostate cancer postradiotherapy, either external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or both, were included. Data were analyzed from March to July 2025.sFT using HIFU or cryotherapy vs sRP.The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival up to 10 years. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, any perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grades 1-5), and major perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grades 3-5). Comparisons were made on matched patients following 1:1 cardinality matching within individual multiply-imputed datasets. Matching variables used were radiotherapeutic treatment, years between primary and salvage treatments, European Association of Urology recurrence risk group, and presalvage age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, grade group, T stage, and androgen-deprivation therapy use.A total of 923 patients were eligible for matching (419 undergoing sFT and 504 undergoing sRP). Of the patients undergoing sFT, 325 (77.6%) underwent HIFU and the remainder cryotherapy, with 241 (57.5%) treated with quadrant ablation. Of patients treated with sRP, 376 (74.6%) underwent open surgery and the remainder robot-assisted surgery. For sFT vs sRP, 10-year cancer-specific survival was 92% (95% CI, 86%-98%) vs 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%), with no statistically significant difference (restricted mean time lost, -0.09 years; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.03 years; P = .15; subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.05-4.00; P = .47). There was no statistically significant difference in 10-year overall survival (restricted mean survival time, -0.13 years; 95% CI, -0.86 to 0.60 years; P = .72). Undergoing sRP was associated with statistically significant higher odds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio, 24.20; 95% CI, 12.94-45.27; P < .001) and major complication (adjusted odds ratio, 9.31; 95% CI, 3.42-25.36; P < .001).In this cohort study, sFT and sRP were effective for treating localized radiorecurrent prostate cancer, while sFT was associated with fewer perioperative complications. sFT may provide a favorable therapeutic ratio for many patients with localized radiorecurrent prostate cancer.",JAMA oncology,"Feb 12, 2026",2026.0,Feb,12.0,Alexander Light|Max Peters|Manit Arya|Mariana Bertoncelli Tanaka|Tim Dudderidge|Amr Emara|Mark Emberton|Alistair Grey|Richard Hindley|Marc Laniado|Stuart McCraken|Caroline M Moore|Raj Nigam|Mohamed Noureldin|Clement Orczyk|Deepika Reddy|Jaspal Virdi|Mohamed Ahmed|Simone Albisinni|Paul Cathcart|Steven Joniau|Robert J Karnes|Raj Persad|Pawel Rajwa|Rafael Sanchez-Salas|Shahrokh F Shariat|Joseph A Smith|Derya Tilki|Henk van der Poel|Giorgio Calleris|Paolo Gontero|Giancarlo Marra|Hashim U Ahmed|Taimur T Shah,Mohamed Ahmed|Robert J Karnes,"Imperial Prostate, Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, England, United Kingdom.|Imperial Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Radiotherapiegroep, Deventer, the Netherlands.|University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.|Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basingstoke, United Kingdom.|Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.|University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, Slough, United Kingdom.|South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, Sunderland, United Kingdom.|Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, United Kingdom.|The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, Harlow, United Kingdom.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Policlinico Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy.|Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Universitair Ziekenhuis Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.|North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.|Department of Urology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.|Department of Urology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.|McGill University, Montréal, Quebec, Canada.|Hourani Center for Applied Scientific Research, Al-Ahliyya Amman University, Amman, Jordan.|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.|Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.|Department of Urology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.|Department of Urology, Koc University Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.|Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.|Division of Urology, Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.|Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.","Alexander Light, Max Peters, Manit Arya, Mariana Bertoncelli Tanaka, Tim Dudderidge, Amr Emara, Mark Emberton, Alistair Grey, Richard Hindley, Marc Laniado, Stuart McCraken, Caroline M Moore, Raj Nigam, Mohamed Noureldin, Clement Orczyk, Deepika Reddy, Jaspal Virdi, Mohamed Ahmed, Simone Albisinni, Paul Cathcart, Steven Joniau, Robert J Karnes, Raj Persad, Pawel Rajwa, Rafael Sanchez-Salas, Shahrokh F Shariat, Joseph A Smith, Derya Tilki, Henk van der Poel, Giorgio Calleris, Paolo Gontero, Giancarlo Marra, Hashim U Ahmed, Taimur T Shah",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678176/,"Patients with recurrent prostate cancer after previous radiation therapy often have poor survival.

Despite recent advancements in molecularly targeted therapies for patients with IDH1 mutations and FGFR2 fusions, the efficacy of integrating these agents with first-line chemotherapy has not been established. This multicenter, Phase Ib dose de-escalation study, conducted prior to the establishment of chemoimmunotherapy as the standard first-line therapy, evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of combining ivosidenib or pemigatinib with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced CCA. Eligible patients with no disease progression after three cycles of standard chemotherapy were assigned to receive either ivosidenib or pemigatinib based on their mutation status and chemotherapy. The primary endpoints were to evaluate safety, tolerability, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase II dose. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and best response profile. The study opened in January 2020 and closed early in November 2022, enrolling eight patients - seven in the ivosidenib arm (Arm A) and one in the pemigatinib arm (Arm B). Enrollment in Arm B was constrained due to challenges in identifying FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement-positive patients in the first-line setting. Treatment-related toxicities of grade 3 or higher occurred in four patients (66.7%) in Arm A. Regarding efficacy, one patient (16.7%) in Arm A achieved a partial response, while the remaining five had stable disease, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 15.4 months in Arm A and a median overall survival (OS) of 22.9 months. Given the selection bias and small sample size, these efficacy analyses must be interpreted with caution. Adding ivosidenib to gemcitabine and cisplatin in this study demonstrated a challenging safety profile in advanced CCA.

It is uncertain if these changes are associated with muscle quality. This study estimated changes in muscle quality and HRQoL in BC participants over 24 months of treatment and tested associations with muscle quality and HRQoL.Women (n = 149, 50.3 ± 10.7 years) diagnosed with stage I-III BC (PREVENT-WF-98213) reported HRQoL via Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) surveys at baseline prior to cancer treatment and at 6-months and 24-months follow up from treatment initiation. Paraspinal intermuscular fat (IMF) and skeletal muscle (SM) were determined by magnetic resonance imaging, and the IMF:SM ratio was calculated to estimate muscle quality. Analyses included linear mixed-effects models adjusting for study group (placebo/statin), age, race, and body mass index.HRQoL declined from baseline to 6-months but returned to baseline levels by 24-months. Muscle quality worsened from baseline through 24-months manifested by an increase in IMF. Individuals with better muscle quality at baseline reported declines in HRQoL from baseline to 6-months (mean difference [MD] = - 0.12 ± 0.03, p < 0.001), whereas participants with poor baseline muscle quality did not (MD = - 0.06 ± 0.003, p = 0.14).

The revised guideline aims to help physicians, staff, and medical physics experts improve safety and minimize occupational risks in this field. While the guideline offers comprehensive guidance, the authors note that further research may be needed to address certain aspects of occupational protection in interventional radiology.",Radiology,Cardiology
41677273,2026-02-13,A Comprehensive 3D Look into Male and Female Facial Skeletons: AI-Assisted Analysis of 280 CT Scans.,"Sexual dimorphism in the facial skeleton is fundamental to aesthetics and gender perception. This study employs AI-assisted three-dimensional (3D) imaging to analyze morphological differences between males and females in the upper, mid, and lower facial regions.A retrospective analysis was conducted on 280 high-resolution craniofacial CT scans (147 females, 133 males) of adults aged 20 years and older. AI-assisted segmentation and modeling were performed using Materialise Mimics and 3-Matic software. The facial skeleton was divided into upper, mid, and lower regions for detailed morphometric evaluation. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) and heatmaps were used to visualize surface projection differences across age groups. Statistical comparisons were conducted to assess gender-based variation.Significant sexual dimorphism was observed across all facial regions. In the upper face, males had greater interorbital width, frontotemporal brow width, inter-medial canthi distance, and more prominent frontal bossing. In the midface, males exhibited increased width, depth, and vertical height, with the most pronounced differences occurring in middle age. The lower face showed larger mandibular dimensions in males, including bigonial width, ramus height, and a sharper mental angle, while females had a more rounded chin and smoother mandibular contour. Heatmaps confirmed greater surface projection in male skeletons, particularly in the gonial and midfacial regions, with dimorphism decreasing with age.This represents the first large-sample CT study utilizing AI to comprehensively quantify facial skeletal dimorphism.

Although treatment for colorectal cancer can have devastating consequences to sexual function and fertility, these issues remain under-recognized and seldom addressed.To better understand the impact of colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexual and reproductive health.Qualitative study of patients with early-onset colorectal cancer.Semi-structured one-on-one zoom interviews of patients recruited through convenience sampling from 7 academic institutions.Sixty-three individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer before age 50 were interviewed between March 2021 and August 2024.Patient perspectives of sexual and reproductive health impacts of colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment. Data were analyzed iteratively using directed and conventional qualitative content analysis.Participants discussed sexual and reproductive health side effects resulting from surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. These side effects ranged in severity, with some experiencing almost none and others facing significant issues. They identified several domains, including surgical and treatment side effects, psychological impacts, effects on relationships, and unmet needs. Subdomains included sexual health, reproductive health, emotional distress, body image, communication challenges, impacts on dating, informational needs, financial support, and consultations.Participants were recruited from academic medical centers only, and as such responses may not reflect the experiences of those cared for in non-academic settings.Sexual and reproductive health are critical but often overlooked concerns among younger patients with CRC, with significant impacts on physical functioning, partner relationships, and psychological well-being. Current survivorship guidelines fail to adequately address these needs.

Inappropriate imaging studies may be performed despite the Choosing Wisely Canada guidelines. The objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of spinal ultrasounds performed in 2 Canadian provinces and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of spinal ultrasound and MRI in predicting the need for neurosurgical intervention.This multicenter retrospective cohort study identified spinal ultrasounds in neonates younger than 6 months of age from January 1, 2017, to December 30, 2018, in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. The authors collected data on patient demographic characteristics, reasons for requested imaging, the presence of any imaging abnormalities, and the ultimate need for intraspinal surgery. Ultrasounds were deemed appropriate if the Choosing Wisely guidelines were followed for ordering. The authors compared high-risk findings on spinal ultrasound and MRI to the need for surgery using sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV).A total of 1043 ultrasounds were ordered in 1042 neonates, most commonly by pediatricians (49%), family doctors (27%), and neonatologists (16%). Three hundred eighty-three ultrasounds (37%) were deemed inappropriately ordered. Sixty-nine infants (7%) of the cohort received an MRI and 11 (1%) ultimately underwent neurosurgical intervention. None of the patients who had an inappropriately ordered ultrasound underwent surgery. Spinal ultrasound, compared to surgery, had a sensitivity of 36%, specificity of 98%, PPV of 17%, and NPV of 99%. Spinal MRI, compared to surgery, had a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 76%, PPV of 38%, and NPV of 94%.Although spinal ultrasound has an acceptable specificity in predicting surgery, it remains a poor screening test (36% sensitivity). Given that approximately 37% of spinal ultrasounds were inappropriately ordered in this study period, the authors estimate that if physicians followed the Choosing Wisely Guidelines more closely, it would result in an estimated potential cost savings of CAD$1,856,769 over a decade for Canada with minimal surgical impact and a very low risk of missing surgically relevant spinal dysraphism.",Journal of neurosurgery.

The survey assessed surgeons' demographics, practice settings, surgical preferences, and imaging practices. Responses were summarized and compared using statistical tests for frequency distribution.A total of 111 surgeons (40.0%) responded to the survey. Utilization of endoscopic DCR (endoDCR) was highly variable, with 57% of junior surgeons (<5 years in practice) using it for >66% of their cases, compared with only 18.3% of surgeons with >15 years postfellowship experience. High utilization of endoDCR (>66% of cases) was more common in academic surgeons compared with private practice (48.4% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.01). The most cited reasons for endoDCR were scar avoidance and revision surgery. For external DCR, anatomical barriers and concern for mass/need for biopsy were common indications. Most surgeons only order imaging for certain indications, such as prior sinonasal surgery, facial trauma, suspected tumor, or atypical presentation.Utilization of endoDCR was correlated with years in practice, with younger surgeons preferring the endoscopic technique.

Prior studies have been limited by small samples and incomplete biopsy data. We evaluated a large biopsy-confirmed cohort to characterize clinicopathologic features of SS with renal involvement and identify predictors of renal recovery and long-term outcomes.We retrospectively identified adults with SS and kidney biopsy at Mayo Clinic (2012-2025). Clinical, laboratory, and histologic data were extracted. Predictors of complete renal recovery within 6 months, defined as serum creatinine (sCr) returning to within 25% of baseline or <1.4 mg/dL if baseline was unknown, were evaluated using logistic regression. Cox regression assessed long-term risk of a composite endpoint: newly developed or progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.Fifty-six patients were included (median age 57 years; 91% female). Extraglandular manifestations occurred in 76%, and baseline CKD in 65%. Median sCr at baseline and biopsy were 1.3 and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. Anti-Ro/SSA was positive in 80%. Low C3 occurred in 14% and low C4 in 25%. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was the predominant lesion (71%). Moderate/severe interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy and arteriosclerosis were present in 36% and 41%, respectively. Immunosuppressive therapy was applied in 84%.Complete recovery occurred in 67%. Over a median 3.9 years (IQR 1.4-7.2), 43% reached the composite endpoint. Baseline sCr ≥2mg/dL, 24-hour proteinuria ≥1g, and presence of segmental glomerulosclerosis were associated with lower odds of recovery (OR=0.16, 0.13 and 0.11, P=0.02, 0.001 and 0.008, respectively) and higher long-term risk (HR=4.51, 2.92 and 3.52, P=0.002, 0.01 and 0.02, respectively).

41686506,2026-02-14,Relationship between Total Kidney Volume and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,"Total kidney volume (TKV) is accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and the most commonly used response biomarker for proof-of-concept intervention trials. However, the magnitude of treatment effect on TKV that would be predictive of a meaningful improvement in a clinical outcome, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), is unknown. Inference of this from observational studies has previously been approached by examining inter-individual variance in the relationship between TKV and GFR slopes over time.We developed a novel approach to modeling the intra-individual relationship between TKV and eGFR. Patients from the CRISP and HALT-A dataset were stratified by Mayo Imaging Class (MIC). Linear mixed models were fitted to eGFR with a fixed effect of log(TKV) and random intercepts, and the average slope within each MIC was estimated.We found that within each MIC there is a consistent, linear relationship between log(TKV) and eGFR. The model predicts that within classes 1C-1E, for each 1% point per year reduction in TKV growth rate, the rate of eGFR decline would be reduced by 0.40 to 0.52 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year.We have developed a new model that provides a framework for defining the magnitude of treatment effect on TKV that would support accelerated approval of a drug for ADPKD.Copyright © 2026 by the American Society of Nephrology.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,"Feb 13, 2026",2026.0,Feb,13.0,Alan SL Yu|Chelsie Parker|Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo|Douglas P Landsittel|Rekha Garg|Edmund C Lee|Arlene B Chapman|Frederic F Rahbari-Oskoui|Michal Mrug|Peter C Harris|Vicente E Torres,Peter C Harris|Vicente E Torres,"Division of Nephrology and Hypertension and the Jared Grantham Kidney Institute, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, Indiana.|Department of Biostatistics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.|Regulus Therapeutics, San Diego, California.|Division of Nephrology, University of Chicago School of Medicine.|Department of Internal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.|Division of Nephrology, University of Alabama and the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama.|Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Alan SL Yu, Chelsie Parker, Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo, Douglas P Landsittel, Rekha Garg, Edmund C Lee, Arlene B Chapman, Frederic F Rahbari-Oskoui, Michal Mrug, Peter C Harris, Vicente E Torres",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41686506/,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic condition that causes the kidneys to enlarge with fluid-filled cysts, leading to kidney failure.

The key research question was whether HVRI and HARI can reliably detect significant fibrosis in chronic liver disease.A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Eligible studies assessed HVRI or HARI against biopsy-confirmed fibrosis grades. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a random-effects model to account for inter-study heterogeneity. Four studies met the inclusion criteria.HVRI demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with pooled sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 0.75-0.97; I2 = 69%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI, 0.84-0.93; I2 = 11%). In contrast, HARI showed lower sensitivity of 65% (95% CI, 0.44-0.81; I2 = 82%) and specificity of 60% (95% CI, 0.42-0.76; I2 = 81.2%).

It evaluates the cardiovascular effects of novel anti-obesity medications and their integration into current treatment paradigms. Additionally, these pharmacologic strategies are contextualized alongside lifestyle interventions and metabolic bariatric surgery.Incretin agonist therapies, including both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have shown substantial efficacy in weight reduction and cardiometabolic improvement. Clinical trials have demonstrated that these agents not only reduce body weight by 10-20% but also significantly lower the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. These benefits have been observed in both patients with and without diabetes mellitus, and the cardiovascular protection extends beyond glycemic control. Tirzepatide, in particular, has shown superior efficacy compared to GLP-1 monotherapy in weight loss. Pharmacologic therapy has become a central pillar in the management of obesity-related cardiovascular risk.

41686327,2026-02-14,"Demographics, methods of use, and perceived benefits among patients with cancer who use cannabis.","The purpose of this study was to assess the demographics, reasons, methods, perceived benefits, and costs associated with the use of cannabis among patients with cancer.Paper and electronic surveys in English were offered to patients visiting select oncology offices in Northern California between February 2018 and May 2024. Questions gathered information on participants' demographics, cancer stage, chemotherapy status, methods, and reasons for cannabis use (e.g., appetite, nausea, sleep, pain), symptom severity ratings (1-10) before and after use, and monthly expenditure. Logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Of the 2602 completed surveys, 643 (24.7%) respondents reported using cannabis. Factors significantly associated with use included younger age (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95, 0.97), advanced cancer (Stage 4, OR 3.28; 95% CI 1.25, 8.61), and concurrent chemotherapy treatment (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.80, 3.35). Non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity showed increased odds of use, whereas Hispanic (OR 0.61; CI 0.38, 0.98), Pacific Islander (OR 0.33; CI 0.17, 0.63), and Asian Indians (OR 0.34; CI 0.12, 0.92) had decreased odds. The primary reason for use was improving sleep (56.7%). Preferred methods included smoking/vaping (68%) and edibles (60%), with over 65% of users employing multiple methods. Patients consistently reported perceived symptom improvements, and most spent less than $100 per month.While efficacy evidence remains limited, cancer patients in this cohort who used cannabis reported tangible benefits in symptom management. Controlled research is crucial to determine the clinical benefits and potential harms, enabling clinicians to provide informed guidance on safe and effective cannabis use.© 2026.

We aim to determine if the use of a kinesthetic learning tool will increase short- and long-term undergraduate student knowledge retention of amino acids and their structures. The treatment group received a set of 3D printed amino acids to study and was assigned an amino acid to create using 3D modeling software. Quantitative assessment data were collected in quiz and exam formats. The treatment group completed a quantitative online survey and qualitative interview on their experience. Upper division undergraduate students overwhelmingly reported that designing a 3D amino acid provided a sense of accomplishment and added value to their experience in biochemistry. Short-term structural knowledge retention was improved in the treatment group, as determined by quiz scores. Most students indicated they would recommend this assignment to future students. Through this work, we have shown that incorporating 3D printing as a kinesthetic learning tool in Biochemistry not only improves short-term undergraduate student knowledge retention of amino acid structure, but also provides an engaging mechanism for students to interact hands-on with content that adds value to their learning experience.© 2026 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,"Feb 13, 2026",2026.0,Feb,13.0,Austin Fisher|Mariah Thomas|Angela Madira|Jerol Skinner|Lauren Wilcox|Cammi Valdez,Angela Madira,"Department of Natural Sciences, Northeastern State University, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, USA.|Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Center for Teaching and Learning, Northeastern State University, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, USA.|Harold Hamm Diabetes Center, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.","Austin Fisher, Mariah Thomas, Angela Madira, Jerol Skinner, Lauren Wilcox, Cammi Valdez",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41685632/,"Proteins are crucial in biochemistry, so it is important for students to understand amino acids and their structures.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate group 1 PH with high PAWP>15 mm Hg.Patients with adjudicated group 1 PH from PVDOMICS between 2016 and 2019 were separated into high PAWP(>15 mm Hg) or normal PAWP and compared with adjudicated combined pre- and postcapillary (Cpc) PH related to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Participants underwent dynamic right heart catheterization and metabolomics. Findings were validated in 3 independent cohorts with adjudicated group 1 PH (validation cohorts 1 and 2 with exercise right heart catheterization and validation cohort 3 with resting right heart catheterization).Of 325 patients with group 1 PH (73% women, mean age 53.0±14.3 years), 15% (n=48) had high PAWP. Group 1 PH+high PAWP demonstrated greater obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy (P<0.0002), left ventricular strain impairment (P<0.0001), and decreased left ventricular compliance (P<0.0001) compared with group 1 PH+normal PAWP, with changes comparable to Cpc-PH HFpEF (n=75). Compared with Cpc-PH HFpEF, left atrial function was better in group 1 PH+high PAWP with lower PAWP V wave, higher left atrial compliance, and left atrial ejection fraction (P<0.0001 for all). Metabolomics demonstrated little difference between group 1 PH with high versus normal PAWP but large differences between group 1 PH+high PAWP versus Cpc-PH HFpEF (100 metabolites altered at false discovery rate P<0.05). Elevated PAWP was also observed in 18% of group 1 PH in the validation cohort 1 (n=402), with exercise PAWP response intermediately abnormal in group 1 PH+high PAWP relative to Cpc-PH HFpEF and group 1 PH+normal PAWP (interaction P<0.0001). Elevated PAWP was similarly observed in 22% and 19% of group 1 PH in validation cohorts 2 (n=55) and 3 (n=787), respectively.Approximately 1 in 5 adjudicated patients with group 1 PH has elevation in resting PAWP despite severe pulmonary vascular dysfunction and metabolomics consistent with traditionally defined group 1 PH. Despite resting PAWP elevation, these patients with group 1 PH were metabolomically and biologically distinct from Cpc PH HFpEF, with better left atrial function and diastolic reserve during exercise. These data emphasize the limitations of using resting PAWP alone to separate group 1 PH from HFpEF and call for development of more integrated clinical diagnostic criteria.",Circulation,"Feb 13, 2026",2026.0,Feb,13.0,Yogesh NV Reddy|Robert P Frantz|William R Miranda|Aneesh K Asokan|Revati Varma|Franz Rischard|Paul M Hassoun|Anna R Hemnes|Evelyn Horn|Jane A Leopold|Erika B Rosenzweig|Nicholas S Hill|Serpil C Erzurum|Gerald J Beck|John Barnard|J E Finet|Deborah Kwon|Stephen C Mathai|Monica Mukherjee|W HW Tang|K S Nair|Barry A Borlaug,Yogesh NV Reddy|Robert P Frantz|William R Miranda|Aneesh K Asokan|Revati Varma|K S Nair|Barry A Borlaug,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine (Y.N.V.R., R.P.F., W.R.M., R.V., B.A.B.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Division of Endocrinology (A.K.A., K.S.N.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ (F.R.).|Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (P.M.H., S.C.M., M.M.).|Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN (A.R.H.).|Perkin Heart Failure Center, Division of Cardiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY (E.H.).|Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (J.A.L.).|Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY (E.B.R.).|Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA (N.S.H.).|Lerner Research Institute (S.C.E.), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.|Departments of Quantitative Health Sciences (G.J.B., J.B.), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.|Cardiovascular Medicine (J.E.F., D.K., W.H.W.T.), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.","Yogesh NV Reddy, Robert P Frantz, William R Miranda, Aneesh K Asokan, Revati Varma, Franz Rischard, Paul M Hassoun, Anna R Hemnes, Evelyn Horn, Jane A Leopold, Erika B Rosenzweig, Nicholas S Hill, Serpil C Erzurum, Gerald J Beck, John Barnard, J E Finet, Deborah Kwon, Stephen C Mathai, Monica Mukherjee, W HW Tang, K S Nair, Barry A Borlaug",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41685452/,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition that can lead to heart failure.

Good death was also positively correlated with individuals' likelihood of having end-of-life documentation but negatively correlated with having aftercare documents. Further, individuals with high levels of communication apprehension about death were significantly less likely to have advance care and aftercare plans. Multiple regressions forecasted that communication with others and communication apprehension about death were major contributors to documenting preferences.Study findings suggest that the meaning individuals place on what they believe makes a good death could make it difficult for them to communicate their wishes to others.

Of these, 7 focused on pretreatment prognosis, 6 evaluated radiosurgery outcomes, 4 examined microsurgery outcomes, and 1 assessed response to bevacizumab. The imaging modalities investigated included radiomics (n = 10), positron emission tomography (PET; n = 2), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI; n = 2), both PET and DCE-MRI (n = 1), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE; n = 1), contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT; n = 1), and slip interface imaging (SII; n = 1). Radiomic studies yielded encouraging results in predicting tumor growth after wait-and-scan and radiosurgery, with reported accuracies ranging from 52% to 88%, sensitivities from 13% to 95%, specificities from 50% to 94%, and area under the curves from 0.65 to 0.99. PET studies identified several promising ligands associated with tumor growth during wait-and-scan, suggesting a potential role in prognostication. DCE-MRI also demonstrated associations with tumor growth and treatment response to bevacizumab. Studies on MRE, CE-CT, and SII identified novel imaging parameters associated with tumor stiffness and adhesion.Several emerging imaging modalities hold potential for improving clinical outcome prognostication in VS. Techniques such as radiomics, PET, and DCE-MRI have shown promising results; however, the supporting evidence is still limited and heterogeneous.

However, their long-term prevalence and trajectories remain poorly defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the long-term prevalence in COVID-19 survivors of fourteen specific NMDs and related symptoms: cranial nerve diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, small fiber neuropathy, (poly)radiculopathies, (poly)neuropathies, plexopathies, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, neuropathic pain, sarcopenia, myalgia, myalgia associated with other symptoms, and of other muscle diseases.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (January 2020 through November 2024) for studies with at least 3 months of follow-up. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated at multiple time points (acute phase to 24 months) using random effects models.Among 180 unique studies representing 15,865,322 cases (54 % female, mean age 50.0 years), the pooled prevalence for individuals with at least one NMD or related symptoms decreased from 36 % in the acute phase to 8 % at 24 months. Myalgia prevalence steadily declined from 35 % to 8 % by two years. A trend towards lower prevalences across the time points was observed also for Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other muscle diseases, while other conditions showed a more erratic pattern. The prevalence of neuropathic pain remained high and persisted almost unchanged through the follow-up period (from 31 % in the acute phase to 25 % at 12 months).NMDs and related symptoms are common following COVID-19, but their general prevalence decreases with time.

41653086,2026-02-15,Control arm overperformance in phase 3 oncology clinical trials.,"In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), anticipating control arm outcomes is important for power calculations and enrollment goals. Unexpected overperformance of the control arm can underpower RCTs. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of control arm overperformance in phase 3 oncology RCTs.The authors conducted a meta-epidemiological study of two-arm, superiority-design, phase 3 oncology RCTs. They reviewed articles/publications and protocols for power calculations, justification, and outcomes. Control arm performance was measured as the ratio of observed control arm outcomes relative to pretrial estimates, and overperformance was defined as a 10% improvement.In total, 385 RCTs met inclusion criteria. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in 134 RCTs (35%). Of 311 RCTs (81%) that provided a pretrial estimate for control arm performance, 138 RCTs (44%) cited a justification for the estimate. Greater than expected control arm performance was associated with lower odds of meeting the primary end point (adjusted odds ratio, 0.989; 95% confidence interval, 0.981-0.998; p = 0.015). Of 244 RCTs that were evaluable for control arm performance, 104 (43%) exhibited overperformance. RCTs that used OS as a primary end point were more likely to exhibit control arm overperformance compared with RCTs that used other primary end points (56% vs. 33%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.15; p = .001).Control arm overperformance is common in phase 3 oncology RCTs and is associated with trial outcomes, suggesting an effect on study power.

41297711,2026-02-15,Early glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use after myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is among the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This study evaluated whether initiation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) post-AMI improves cardiovascular outcomes in this population.This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX Research Network to identify adult patients with T2DM who experienced an AMI between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023. Patients were included if they initiated tirzepatide or semaglutide within 14 days post-AMI. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was recurrent coronary events, and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and hospitalizations, heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, acute kidney injury (AKI), and cardiac arrest. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.5338 patients were included in each cohort. Mean follow-up was 327.7 days (GLP1RA group) vs. 307.9 days (non-GLP1RA group). GLP1RA use did not significantly reduce recurrent coronary events (3.7 % vs 3.8 %; HR 0.913, 95 % CI 0.750-1.111). GLP1RA use was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.484, 95 % CI 0.413-0.567), HF hospitalizations (HR 0.578, 95 % CI 0.531-0.630), AKI (HR 0.688, 95 % CI 0.610-0.732), cardiac arrest (HR 0.549, 95 % CI 0.418-0.722), and all-cause hospitalizations (HR 0.673, 95 % CI 0.636-0.713).GLP1RA initiation in patients with T2DM post-AMI was not associated with a reduction in recurrent coronary events, but was linked to improvements in other cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting a potential role for GLP1RAs as part of a secondary prevention strategy.Copyright © 2024.

41448046,2026-02-15,Development of cell-active BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors to decode the role of BET proteins in LPS-mediated liver inflammation.,"The endogenously expressed BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4) are upstream clinical targets for anti-inflammatory treatments, where inhibition of the tandem bromodomains (D1 and D2) have proven efficacious in vitro and in vivo towards NF-κB-mediated inflammation. Despite their efficacy, dose-limiting toxicities associated with BET inhibition have limited clinical progression. One strategy to circumvent these dose-limiting toxicities has included domain- or protein-selective inhibition of the BET bromodomains. Based on previously reported 1,2,4-substituted imidazole scaffolds, we characterize and report on next-generation BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors, 39 and 41. Compound 39 is both highly potent and selective towards BRD4-D1 (Ki = 2.9 ± 1.0 nM, >1700-fold over BRD2-D1 via fluorescence anisotropy) over other BET bromodomains in addition to being cell-active at nanomolar concentrations. We also characterized 39's solubility and cellular activity in addition to its off-target hERG liability (a common cardiovascular risk for drug candidates). An acetylated analogue, 41, had an 80-fold reduced hERG affinity compared to previous BRD4-D1 selective compounds. In the context of liver inflammation, we screened 39 against an LPS-mediated cellular model of liver inflammation. Upon treatment with 39, pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 transcripts were significantly downregulated compared to the control; however, BRD4-D1 selective inhibition remained insufficient to reproduce the anti-inflammatory activity of pan-BET treatment. On a mechanistic level, these data highlight that more than one bromodomain within the BET family may be contributing to CXCL1 and CCL2 expression, where multi-domain inhibition or other therapeutic modalities may be needed in these contexts to achieve sufficient anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40779761,2026-02-15,Opinions Regarding Dual-Implant Fixation and Weight-Bearing in Distal Femur Fractures: A Survey From the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association Traveling Fellowship.,"To describe current opinions of staff orthopaedic trauma surgeons on the surgical treatment of distal femur fractures, with attention to indications for dual-implant constructs, application techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation.A 22-question survey was given to fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeons at institutions visited by the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association Fellows to characterize opinions on techniques, indications, and postoperative weight-bearing status for five example distal femur fractures. Demographic data were collected. Participants responses on implants and weight-bearing were recorded. Opinions on technique of dual-implant fixation were collected.The survey was returned by 57 surgeons. Most respondents preferred a single implant (retrograde intramedullary nails or lateral locked plate) and weight-bearing as tolerated for the extra-articular and periprosthetic fracture. The preference for dual-implant fixation increased with metaphyseal bone loss (46%) and for nonunion treatment (53%). Articular involvement had the strongest effect on weight-bearing (17% weight-bearing as tolerated with simple articular split, 6% with articular comminution). Respondents preferred a retrograde intramedullary nails plus lateral locked plate over dual-plate fixation. Rationale for dual-implant fixation were early mobilization (32%), poor distal fixation (32%), and absent medial column support (30%).This survey of current practice among institutions participating in the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association Traveling Fellowship demonstrates that common fracture-related indications for dual-implant fixation include nonunion treatment and comminuted fractures with bone loss. The ability for earlier mobilization, poor fixation, and lack of medial column support were the most common indications for dual-implant fixation. This survey highlights the need for further studies investigating best treatment for distal femur fractures and sets the stage for future studies of dual-implant constructs.V, descriptive survey study.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Feb 15, 2026",2026.0,Feb,15.0,Austen L Thompson|Ankur Khanna|Emily A Wagstrom|Milton T Little|Brandon J Yuan,Austen L Thompson,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Thompson, Khanna, and Yuan), Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, M.N.

41529573,2026-02-15,The impact of adding optical coherence tomography in MS diagnostic criteria on the classification of tumefactive demyelination.,"De novo tumefactive demyelination (TD) poses a diagnostic challenge, with lower rates of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands and lower female-to-male ratio than typical onset multiple sclerosis (MS). Only about half fulfill the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS at presentation. Therefore, our aim was to assess optic nerve involvement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with TD. Further, whether the presence of abnormalities on OCT would allow additional TD patients to be diagnosed with MS when the optic nerve is added as a fifth topography to the Barkhof criteria or 2017 McDonald criteria.Observational retrospective chart review of patients seen at a tertiary referral center from 1/1/1990 to 2/21/2024 with TD. Inclusion criteria were: 1) brain MRI showing an active TD lesion; 2) medical records with at least one available clinical assessment by a neurologist; 3) available Cirrus OCT data to review. Exclusion criteria were: 1) patients with final diagnosis of vasculitis, abscess, CNS malignancies, or MOGAD; 2) presence of confounding ocular disease.OCT was available in 68 patients with TD. The tumefactive attack was the first demyelinating event in 45 (67 %) patients. At presentation, 29/68 (43 %) fulfilled 3 of 4 Barkhof criteria, and 34/68 (50 %) fulfilled the 2017 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS. A clinical history of optic neuritis was present in 9/68 (13 %) patients and OCT was abnormal in 9/9 (100 %) of those patients. Regardless of clinical history, OCT was abnormal in 22/68 (32 %) patients. Therefore, OCT identified abnormalities suggestive of prior optic neuritis in 13/59 (22 %) TD patients without a clinical history of optic neuritis. If the optic nerve, as a firth topography, was assessed by OCT 39/68 (57 %) would fulfill McDonald criteria.OCT in patients presenting with TD lesions can frequently identify both clinical and subclinical optic neuritis. The addition of the optic nerve as a fifth topography assessed by OCT to fulfill dissemination in space criteria would allow additional TD patients to be diagnosed with MS.Copyright © 2024.

In clinical practice and research studies, imaging of spinal cord is usually restricted to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can show its most superior region.To evaluate the ability of brain MRI to detect spinal cord critical lesions in progressive MS.Individuals with one or two tandem spinal cord critical lesions were selected from a cohort of people with progressive MS, evaluated at Mayo Clinic between July 1, 2021-June 30, 2022. Lesions were cross-checked on spinal cord MRI to ensure visibility. Brain MRI performed at Mayo Clinic or an outside institution during clinical evaluation were assessed; if none were available, the most recent prior MRI was evaluated. Brain MRIs were defined ""informative"" if critical lesions were identified on axial and sagittal sequences and ""incompletely informative"" if not.Sixty-five participants were identified, brain MRIs were ""informative"" in 3 cases (4.6%) and ""incompletely informative"" in 62 (95.4%).

Two neuroradiologists independently scored lumen and wall visualization across the arterial segments on a 4-point Likert scale (1: worst to 4: best) and graded venous flow artifacts along the middle cerebral artery (MCA), peri-mesencephalic veins (PMV), deep cerebral veins (DCV), and cortical veins (CV). Intersequence comparisons used cumulative-link mixed-effects models (CLMMs); segments were additionally pooled and analyzed as proximal versus distal. Venous flow artifact scores were compared with paired Wilcoxon tests between sequences and percentage agreement between readers. Exploratory Bland-Altman analysis was also performed for both readers.A total of 556 vessel-segment pairs were analyzed. In CLMM analysis, T1-SPACEDL+DANTE improved lumen scores versus T1-SPACEDL (pooled OR 40.02; 95% CI 24.06-66.57; FDR p<0.001) but reduced wall scores (pooled OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.14; FDR p<0.001). By anatomic group, lumen ORs were 26.03 (proximal) and 91.93 (distal), and wall ORs were 0.12 (proximal) and 0.04 (distal) (all FDR p<0.001). Venous flow artifacts improved across all analyzed subsites (p<0.001). ±1-point inter-reader concordance was near perfect across analyses. Bland-Altman plots showed negative lumen bias (favoring T1-SPACEDL+DANTE) and positive wall bias (favoring T1-SPACEDL) without consistent proportional bias.Adding DANTE preparation to deep-learning accelerated IC-VWI was associated with fewer flow-related artifacts and a clearer depiction of the vessel lumen, which may support a more accurate assessment of intracranial vasculopathies and aneurysms. Potential gains were accompanied by a modest wall-visualization penalty, which is not unexpected with a flow-suppression pulse.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

We aimed to compare the impacts of these factors on postoperative outcomes in a large population-based cohort.We conducted a national retrospective linked database study of patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent resection for GI or hepatobiliary cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand between 2005 and 2020. Age, comorbidity (C3 Comorbidity Score), and frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score) were examined as independent predictors of 90-day mortality, complications, and FTR (death following a complication). Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates.Among 21,729 patients (mean age 75.8 ± 6.8 years), 49.3% experienced one or more complications and 6.1% died within 90 days (FTR rate of 12.3%). In adjusted models, each additional 5 years of age increased 90-day mortality odds by 40% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.40 and 95% CI 1.34-1.46). Although higher comorbidity (C3 > 3) and frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score > 15) also independently raised mortality risk (aOR 1.98 and 2.04, respectively), age exerted the largest effect on mortality and FTR.Chronological age, comorbidity, and frailty each predict worse outcomes following GI cancer surgery, but advanced age remains the dominant driver of 90-day mortality and FTR.

41689620,2026-02-15,"New Approaches for Measurable Residual Disease Assessment in Multiple Myeloma: Integrating NGS, Mass Spectrometry, and Next-Generation Flow Cytometry to Monitor Treatment Response.","Measurable residual disease (MRD) has emerged as the strongest prognostic biomarker in multiple myeloma (MM), providing a deeper assessment of treatment response than conventional serological tests. Sensitive MRD detection is helpful in risk stratification, prognostication, and early relapse prediction and is increasingly being used as an important clinical trial endpoint in MM. Moreover, MRD has emerged as a useful tool in guiding treatment intensity and duration.MRD can be assessed using bone marrow-based, peripheral blood-based, or imaging-based techniques. Bone marrow-based next-generation flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing, with a minimum sensitivity of 10- 5, remain the current standard for MRD testing in MM. However, limitations like the need for frequent bone marrow aspirations and false negative results in patchy marrow involvement or isolated extramedullary disease have accelerated the interest in peripheral blood-based MRD tools. Mass spectrometry-based approaches, including intact protein mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF assays like 'MASS-FIX' and 'EXENT') and clonotypic peptide mass spectrometry (such as 'EasyM' and 'M-Insight'), have evolved as highly sensitive peripheral blood-based MRD detection tools for relatively non-invasive dynamic MRD monitoring. Newer technologies like droplet digital PCR, circulating tumor cell analysis using enriched flow cytometry, cell-free DNA sequencing, and emerging epigenetic and fragmentomic profiling are in various phases of research and have the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor and treat MM. Finally, numerous active clinical trials worldwide are exploring the role of MRD in guiding treatment and are expected to shed light on the optimal approach to MRD assessments in routine clinical practice.© 2026.

Change from baseline (CfB) in IHS4, IHS4 severity stages and the dichotomous IHS4-55/75/90/100 (an improvement of at least 55%/75%/90%/100% in IHS4 from baseline) are reported to Week 48. Lesion count data by lesion type are reported to Week48.In total, 1014 patients were enrolled across BE HEARD I and II. At baseline, mean (standard deviation [SD]) IHS4 for bimekizumab-treated patients ranged from 33.4 (25.4) for bimekizumab Q2W/Q2W to 36.0 (34.0) for bimekizumab Q2W/Q4W versus 30.6 (21.8) for placebo. At Week16, patients receiving bimekizumab demonstrated greater reductions in mean (SD) IHS4 from baseline, ranging from -17.2 (24.8) for bimekizumab Q4W/Q4W to -17.8 (21.1) for bimekizumab Q2W/Q2W versus -6.1 (16.3) for placebo. Proportions of patients with severe HS at baseline ranged from 83.7% (bimekizumab Q2W/Q2W) to 88.4% (bimekizumab Q2W/Q4W) and decreased by ~50% to Week48 across all treatment arms, ranging from 28.6% (placebo/bimekizumab Q2W) to 34.3% (bimekizumab Q2W/Q2W). Proportions of patients with IHS4 = 0 at Week48 ranged from 23.7% (bimekizumab Q2W/Q4W) to 26.7% (placebo/bimekizumab Q2W). At Week16, IHS4-55, IHS4-75, IHS4-90 and IHS4-100 thresholds were achieved by greater proportions of patients treated with bimekizumab versus placebo, while comparable improvements were seen across treatment arms from Week16 to Week48. At Week16, lesion counts were lower for patients treated with bimekizumab versus placebo, decreasing to comparable numbers across all groups at Week48.Bimekizumab-treated patients showed improvements across IHS4 outcome measures.© 2026 The Author(s).

41248983,2026-02-15,Transcriptional readthrough at Atf4 locus suppresses Rps19bp1 and impairs heart development.,"Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) functions as a transcriptional regulator in various cell types and tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions. While previous studies have linked ATF4 activation with promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, its role in developing CMs remains unexplored.We generated multiple distinct CM-specific (Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) and Atf4cKO(e2)) and global Atf4 knockout (KO; Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins) mouse models targeting different Atf4 regions, as well as CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 to study cardiac phenotypes. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses were performed. Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) [targeting exon 2-3 including the polyadenylation signal (polyA)] mice exhibited severe cardiac defects and died before E17.5, likely due to ectopic activation of the p53 signaling pathway resulting from Rps19bp1 downregulation, a potent suppressor of p53. Further investigation revealed that deleting the polyA signal of Atf4 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice led to transcriptional readthrough, resulting in the formation of an Atf4-Cacna1i fusion transcript and Rps19bp1 downregulation. To avoid readthrough while abolishing ATF4 function, we introduced small indels into exon 3 of Atf4 in mice (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins), which showed normal Rps19bp1 expression and cardiac morphology. Importantly, CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 recapitulated the cardiac defects and transcriptional change seen in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice.We found that the downregulation of Rps19bp1, not the loss of ATF4 function, underlies the cardiac phenotypes in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. The reduced expression of Rps19bp1 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice is likely due to the unintentional deletion of Atf4 polyA signal and subsequent transcriptional readthrough, underscoring the essential role of RPS19BP1, not ATF4, in cardiac development. Consistent Rps19bp1 downregulation has been observed in other tissue-specific Atf4 KO models utilizing the Atf4fl(e2/3/pA) allele, suggesting that previously reported Atf4 KO phenotypes may result from Atf4 transcriptional readthrough effects. These findings reveal a locus-dependent transcriptional interference mechanism and emphasize the importance of avoiding confounding cis effects in genetically engineered models.© The Author(s) 2025.

In patients with syndromic conditions such as Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS), ankylosis presents additional challenges due to airway compromise, restricted mandibular growth, and complex skeletal abnormalities. In addition, predicting the ability to advance the mandible using a prosthesis may be challenging due to anatomic factors.We report the case of an 18-year-old female with TMJ ankylosis, PRS, and KFS, presenting with severe trismus, retrognathia, and failed prior distraction osteogenesis. Imaging confirmed bilateral bony TMJ ankylosis and high-risk airway anatomy due to cervical spine fusion to the skull base. The patient underwent a staged surgical reconstruction involving ankylosis release and delayed alloplastic joint replacement with mandibular advancement. A later revision using new patient-fitted condylar components retained the fossa components and advanced the mandible an additional amount.The prosthetic outcome for mandibular advancement remains excellent six years after final reconstruction. There is no evidence of wound dehiscence, prosthesis loosening, or failure, and overall function remains significantly improved.This case highlights the complexities of TMJ ankylosis in a patient with multiple craniofacial syndromes and demonstrates the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary planning and the utility of prosthetic TMJ reconstruction. Revision using a new condylar component to further advance the mandible is a potential means of treatment while maintaining the fossa component to minimize variables at the time of surgery.© 2026.

41698881,2026-02-17,Gender and Academic Rank Disparities in Electronic Health Record Burden Among Otolaryngologists.,"The electronic health record (EHR) has benefits but also adds documentation burden that is not equally shared between academic faculty. We hypothesize that male gender and senior academic rank are associated with decreased EHR burden compared to female and junior faculty.Demographics from faculty at participating organizations were combined with 3 years of provider efficiency data. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the differences in EHR burden between genders and academic ranks, clustering for otolaryngologist and institution.Forty-six institutions with 914 otolaryngologists (female, n = 283, 31%) were included for analysis. Median hours per day (h/d) spent in EHR tasks related to outpatient visits were 4.3, 3.5, and 3.4 h/d for female assistant, associate, and full professors, respectively; and 3.4, 2.7, and 2.3 h/d for males, likewise in ascending academic rank. These differences between median h/d in ambulatory time were significant across all six subgroups of gender and academic rank (p < 0.002). Academic seniority, but not gender, was associated with less time in ambulatory tasks after work and on days without scheduled appointments (p < 0.002). Males and otolaryngologists with higher academic rank were more likely to receive help with notes and orders (p < 0.002).For a typical clinic day, female assistant professors in academic otolaryngology spent nearly twice as much time as their male full professor counterparts did in the EHR completing tasks related to ambulatory patient care. The differential likelihood of faculty receiving help with notes and orders may play a role in this disparity.© 2026 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.",The Laryngoscope,"Feb 16, 2026",2026.0,Feb,16.0,Theresa Kim|Yassmeen Abdel-Aty|Sarah R Akkina|Greg Ator|Megan Ballard|Mihir K Bhayani|Lauren A Bohm|Hayley Born|Paul Bryson|Thomas L Carroll|Orly Coblens|Alissa Collins|Christine E DeMason|Karuna Dewan|Colin Edwards|Christina H Fang|Nyssa F Farrell|Meha G Fox|Katie Geelan-Hansen|Carla Giannoni|Jennifer Gross|Anna H Grosz|Elizabeth Guardiani|Agnes Hurtuk|Hongzhao Ji|Richard Kelley|Ashley E Kita|Natalie A Krane|Priya Krishna|Maggie Kuhn|Brian C Lobo|Lyndsay L Madden|Stephanie Misono|Nadia Moyhuddin|Matthew R Naunheim|Miriam O'Leary|Sachin Pawar|Nicholas C Purdy|Mindy Rabinowitz|Anaïs Rameau|Katherine Rieth|Jose W Ruiz|Melissa Scholes|Alice L Tang|Neelu Tummala|Andrew M Vahabzadeh-Hagh|James Wang|Lyndy Wilcox|Kathleen Yaremchuk|Vivian Yu|John P Giliberto,Katherine Rieth,"Division of Otolaryngology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA.|Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.|Department of Otolaryngology -

Shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) integrated with mCBCT has been introduced to correct for CT to body divergence (CT-BD) during the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs).Prospective observational multicentre study, enrolling patients with a PPN of ≤20 mm suspicious for malignancy, assessing tool-in-lesion (TIL), diagnostic yield, sensitivity for malignancy and incidence of pneumothorax or airway bleeding. Non-malignant index biopsies were followed for 12 months. Descriptive statistics are reported for all variables along with 95% CI for primary endpoints.155 consecutive patients were enrolled at six centres. Median nodule size was 14.0 mm (IQR 11.0-17.0), with 54.8% of nodules (85/155) in the upper lobes, 25.8% (40/155) with CT bronchus sign present and median distance to the nearest pleural surface of 8.2 mm (IQR 1.8-20.0). TIL was achieved in 154/155 (99.4%, 95% CI 96.5 to 100.0) procedures. A median of two (IQR 1-3) mCBCT spins were performed, with median dose area product of 25.7 Gy · cm2 (IQR 11.0-46.7). Diagnostic yield per the American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians (ATC/ACCP) definition was 89.0% (n=138/155; 95% CI 83.0 to 93.5) and sensitivity for malignancy was 91.5% (95% CI 86.4 to 96.5).

41697492,2026-02-17,The role of tumor-associated macrophages in cancer development and their significance as prognostic markers.,"Macrophages are a diverse group of immune cells which have key roles in immune defense, tumor homeostasis, and wound repair. During the last two decades, the role of macrophages as one of the most abundant tumor-infiltrating stromal cells has gradually emerged. The normal function of these tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor microenvironment (TME) is to suppress tumor cells through triggering both direct cell cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated immune response. However, they have also been implicated in the progression of cancers. Tumor cells produce chemokines that polarize macrophages into tumor-promoting TAMs. This is the reason why the accumulation of TAMs in TME is correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. High plasticity of TAMs makes it feasible to regulate their polarization and adjust the balance between the anti-tumor TAMs and those with pro-tumor phenotypes. In this review, we aim to provide an overview about the origin and polarization of TAMs and their significance as biomarkers for the prediction and prognostication of various cancers.© 2026.

A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted from a Canadian healthcare payer's perspective to guide policy decisions.A decision model was constructed to perform a CEA for MF compared to SoC (moisturizers) for prevention of grade 2 or higher ARD following adjuvant hypo-fractionated whole-breast radiotherapy (RT) based on a Canadian multicentre RCT. Direct and indirect cost data were collected from two oncology centers in Canada. Quality-of-life (QoL) utility values were derived from mapping Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores for patients with grade 2 or higher ARD at week 6 of RT to EQ-5D. A willingness-to-pay (WTF) threshold of CAD 50,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty in decision model assumptions.Base case analysis demonstrated that MF is cost-effective in preventing grade 2 or higher ARD as compared with SoC with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD 3366 per QALY gained. When indirect costs were included, MF resulted in an ICER of CAD 2823 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the results were most sensitive to the QoL utility value for ARD. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed that MF demonstrates 100% probability of cost-effectiveness at a $50,000 per QALY threshold.MF is a cost-effective intervention for preventing high-grade ARD and should be recommended for patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant RT.© 2026.

40876943,2026-02-17,High-Resolution 3T MRI of the Membranous Labyrinth Using Deep Learning Reconstruction.,"The labyrinth is a complex anatomic structure in the temporal bone. However, high-resolution imaging of its membranous portion is challenging because of its small size and the limitations of current MRI techniques. Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) represents a promising approach to advancing MR image quality, enabling higher spatial resolution and reduced noise. This study aims to evaluate DLR high-resolution 3D heavy T2-weighted TSE (3D-T2) MRI sequences for visualizing the labyrinthine structures, comparing them with conventional 3D-T2 sequences. The goal is to improve spatial resolution without prolonging acquisition times, allowing a more detailed view of the labyrinthine microanatomy.High-resolution heavy T2-weighted TSE SPACE images were acquired in patients by using 3D-T2 and improved T2 weighted turbo spin-echo sequence incorporating deep learning reconstruction (DLR-3D-T2). Two radiologists rated structure visibility on a 4-point qualitative scale for the spiral lamina, scala tympani, scala vestibuli, scala media, utricle, saccule, utricular and saccular maculae, membranous semicircular ducts, and ampullary nerves. Ex vivo 9.4T MRI served as an anatomic reference.DLR-3D-T2 significantly improved the visibility of several inner ear structures. The utricle and utricular macula were systematically visualized, achieving grades ≥3 in 95% of cases (P < .001), while the saccule remained challenging to assess, with grades ≥3 in only 10% of cases. The cochlear spiral lamina and scala tympani were better delineated in the first 2 turns but remained poorly visible in the apical turn. Semicircular ducts were only partially visualized, with grades ≥3 in 12.5% to 20% of cases, likely due to resolution limitations relative to their diameter. Ampullary nerves were moderately improved, with grades ≥3 in 52.5% to 55% of cases, depending on the nerve.While DLR does not yet provide a complete anatomic assessment, it represents a important step forward in the noninvasive evaluation of inner ear structures. Pending further technical refinements, this approach may help reduce reliance on delayed gadolinium-enhanced techniques for imaging membranous structures.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40306928,2026-02-17,Higher risk of recurrence in partially thrombosed cerebral aneurysms post-WEB (Woven EndoBridge) device treatment: insights from the WorldWideWEB Consortium registry.,"The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is a prevalent treatment for intracranial aneurysms. While many studies have assessed the obliteration rate post-WEB embolization, few have focused on long-term outcomes in partially thrombosed aneurysms.To assess whether partially thrombosed aneurysms are at higher risk of recurrence or retreatment following WEB embolization compared with non-thrombosed aneurysms.We evaluated data from 22 academic institutions, focusing on previously untreated cerebral aneurysms treated with the WEB device. Logistic regression was utilized to analyze factors predicting long-term aneurysm obliteration and retreatment necessity.Among 1303 patients, 26 presented with a partially thrombosed aneurysm. In the partially thrombosed group, the mean aneurysm maximal diameter was 10.7±4 mm with a neck ratio of 1.99±1.19 mm, larger than in the control group where the mean aneurysm maximal diameter was 6.81±2.37 mm with a neck ratio of 1.64±0.51 mm (P<0.001 for both maximal diameter and neck ratio). At the final follow-up, partially thrombosed aneurysms treated by the WEB device had a 38.5% retreatment rate, compared with 7.0% for non-thrombosed aneurysms (P<0.001). Among partially thrombosed aneurysms, the Raymond-Roy type IIIa/b occlusion rate was higher (38.5% vs 9.9%, P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, partially thrombosed aneurysms compared with non-thrombosed aneurysms had an increased rate of retreatment (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.28 to 10.1).Partially thrombosed aneurysms are associated with a poorer occlusion rate and a higher rate of retreatment following WEB embolization. For partially thrombosed aneurysms, the WEB device appears suboptimal as a first-line treatment, and therefore alternative techniques should be prioritized.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

39947893,2026-02-17,New insights on the predictive value of hypoperfusion intensity ratio in thrombectomy: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with multiple cut-offs.,"The hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR) has emerged as a vital measure of tissue-level collateral blood flow, helping to identify patients who are likely to benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We aimed to assess the HIR's predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes following MT in patients with acute ischemic stroke.PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched to identify studies comparing good versus poor HIR groups based on studies' reported cut-offs. We pooled binary outcomes to calculate odds ratios (OR) and continuous outcomes to calculate mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using random-effects models. PROSPERO registration code: CRD42024609185.14 studies with 2987 patients, 1553 with good HIR and 1434 with poor HIR, were included in this meta-analysis. Patients with poor HIR exhibited a significantly higher baseline infarct volume compared with those with good HIR (MD 30.6 mL, 95% CI 20.8 mL to 40.3 mL, P<0.01), though baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (P=0.12) and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) (P=0.35) were comparable between groups.

41431960,2026-02-18,Adults with Fontan circulation: prognostic value of exercise pulmonary vascular resistance index.,"Decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) during exercise confers favourable prognosis in biventricular physiology, but its role in Fontan circulation remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of PVR index (PVRI) response to exercise in adults post-Fontan palliation.Retrospective cohort of 88 adults (age ≥18 years) post-Fontan undergoing exercise (supine cycling) cardiac catheterization. Patients were categorized into absence (n = 23) or presence (n = 65) of exercise-induced reduction in PVRI. The clinical endpoint was a composite of death or transplantation.Age at catheterization was 32.2 ± 8.8 years, and 45.5% were female. Resting and exercise PVRI were 1.9 ± 0.9 and 1.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.8-2.1) WU·m2, respectively. Clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters were not associated with PVRI response to exercise. During a follow-up of 2.2 ± 1.4 (IQR 1.2-2.6) years, resting PVRI was not associated with the clinical endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95 per WU·m2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-1.74; P = 0.86), whereas exercise PVRI was (HR 2.15 per WU·m2, 95% CI 1.24-3.73; P = .007). Exercise PVRI remained predictive of outcomes after adjusting for exercise pulmonary artery wedge pressure (HR 2.08 per WU·m2, 95% CI 1.19-3.62; P = .01) or clinical risk factors individually. Two-year event-free survival was lower in the no PVRI reduction than in the reduction group (67% vs 95%; P < .001).In adults post-Fontan, PVRI response to exercise is a robust predictor of clinical outcomes and offers additive prognostic information beyond resting invasive haemodynamic data and clinical risk factors, underscoring the importance of invasive exercise testing in this population.© The Author(s) 2025.

40679844,2026-02-18,Arrhythmias in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: an international study.,"There is a paucity of data on arrhythmia burden in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGAs). The present study sought to quantify the incidence of atrial arrhythmia (AA), ventricular arrhythmia (VA), and complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) in patients with ccTGA and identify associated factors.An international, multi-centre, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 29 tertiary hospitals (six countries) between 1990 and 2018. Primary analyses consisted of determining the incidence of a combined outcome consisting of AA, VA, or CAVB, along with its individual components. Factors associated with the different types of arrhythmias were assessed by uni-variable and multi-variable Cox regression analyses.A total of 1131 patients with ccTGA were followed for 9.0 (interquartile range 4.0-17.2) years. Cumulative rates of the primary endpoint at 10, 15, and 20 years were 44.5%, 51.0%, and 58.8%, respectively. AA, VA, and CAVB occurred in 2.1, 1.4, and 2.0 cases per 100 person-years, respectively. In multi-variable analyses, surgery/intervention conferred a greater than three-fold higher risk of AA [hazard ratio (HR) 3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90-4.78, P < .001]. Furthermore, surgery/intervention was significantly associated with a greater risk of VA (HR 1.73, 95% CI 0.98-3.05, P = .003) and CAVB (HR 3.65, 95% CI 2.20-6.05, P < .001). The left bundle branch block was associated with a higher risk of VA (HR 4.03, 95% CI 1.59-10.23, P = .003) and the right bundle branch block with a higher risk of CAVB (HR 3.71, 95% CI 1.81-7.63, P < .001).The arrhythmia burden in patients with ccTGA is substantial, with a high incidence of AA, VA, and CAVB.© The Author(s) 2025.

41702690,2026-02-18,Ethical dilemmas in the use of artificial intelligence in transfusion medicine.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are beginning to enhance key workflows across blood banking (BB) and transfusion medicine (TM), including donor engagement, inventory forecasting, immunohaematology interpretation, haemovigilance and clinical decision support. These tools can extract signals from large, diverse datasets to improve efficiency, consistency and timeliness of care while enabling more proactive patient blood management. At the same time, TM is uniquely sensitive to safety and trust, so the field must pair innovation with disciplined validation and governance. This review surveys emerging applications and distils a balanced ethics and oversight framework tailored to TM and BB practice. Core elements include outcome-focused validation and continuous monitoring; targeted fairness testing where biological or scientific plausibility suggests subgroup differences; layered transparency that distinguishes transparency, interpretability and explainability; and privacy by design with proportionate consent. We emphasize human oversight at every step: clinicians and laboratorians evaluate, monitor and troubleshoot models, perform tasks AI cannot, integrate multiple inputs to make decisions and interact with AI through guardrails such as intended-use statements, confidence thresholds and clear override pathways. Accountability is shared across users, service directors, institutions and regulators. When implemented with these safeguards, AI can reduce preventable errors, improve resource allocation and support more equitable access to safe transfusion.

41701928,2026-02-18,Assessing the Impact of Sociodemographic Factors on Artificial Intelligence Models in Predicting Dementia: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to health care, yet concerns about fairness persist, particularly in relation to sociodemographic disparities. Previous studies suggest that socioeconomic status (SES) and sex may influence AI model performance, potentially affecting groups that are historically underserved or understudied.This study aimed to (1) assess algorithmic bias in AI-driven dementia prediction models based on SES and sex (biological sex), (2) compare the utility of an individual-level SES measure (the Housing-Based Socioeconomic Status [HOUSES] Index) versus an area-level measure (the Area Deprivation Index) for bias detection, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of an oversampling technique (the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous features) for bias mitigation.This study used data from two population-based cohorts: the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging (n=3041) and the Rochester Epidemiology Project (n=19,572). Four AI models (random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, and Naïve Bayes) were trained using a 5-year observation window of structured electronic health record data to predict dementia onset within the subsequent 1-year window. Fairness and model performance were assessed using the balanced error rate (BER) across intersecting SES-sex subgroups. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous features algorithm was applied to the training data to balance the representation of SES groups.Across both cohorts, individuals with lower SES generally exhibited higher BERs (worse performance) than high SES groups, confirming the presence of bias. In the MCSA cohort, males with high SES, as indicated by the HOUSES Index, consistently exhibited the lowest BERs across all evaluated models. Balancing the training data based on a specific SES measure showed a trend toward reducing the BER disparity when evaluated using that same measure. However, this targeted improvement demonstrated nonuniversal benefits; in some cases, it exacerbated disparities when evaluated using other, unbalanced SES measures. This pattern suggests that fairness interventions are not universally beneficial across different definitions of the protected attribute. While the balancing approach improved fairness in model performance for lower SES groups, it often came at the cost of a slight reduction in overall model performance. However, an exception was observed in the MCSA cohort when balancing based on the HOUSES Index using logistic regression, support vector machine, and Naïve Bayes, where the performances of both the high and low SES groups improved.This research highlights the importance of incorporating sociodemographic context into AI modeling in health care. The choice of SES measure may lead to different assessments of algorithmic bias. The HOUSES Index, as a validated individual-level SES measure, may be more effective for bias mitigation than area-level measures. Future AI development should integrate bias mitigation strategies to ensure models do not reinforce existing disparities in health outcomes.© Xingyi Liu, Muskan Garg, Maria Vassilaki, Jennifer St Sauver, Ronald C Petersen, Momin M Malik, Chung Il Wi, Young J Juhn, Sunghwan Sohn.

We tested the hypothesis that the ability of insulin to suppress AT lipolysis is unrelated to the ability of niacin to suppress lipolysis, because niacin acts through a different proximal signaling pathway. Ten volunteers (5 women/5 men) with upper body obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) underwent two study visits with overnight intravenous infusions of niacin (1.4 mg/min) or saline, followed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. FFA-palmitate Ra was measured using [U-13C] and [2H9]palmitate infusions; abdominal AT biopsies were performed before and during the insulin clamp. The suppression of FFA-palmitate Ra by insulin on the saline control day and by niacin after an overnight infusion were highly correlated (r = -0.93, P < 0.001). Fasting AT Akt (pAktS473/474-to-panAkt ratio, P = 0.01) and perilipin 1 (PLN 1) (pPLN1S552-to-panPLN1 ratio, P = 0.02) phosphorylation were less during niacin than the saline control study. Because the suppression of lipolysis by insulin and niacin are highly correlated within individuals and because niacin and insulin act through different proximal signaling pathways, we propose dysregulated AT lipolysis in obesity/T2DM is due to dysfunction(s) in distal lipolysis proteins rather than isolated ""insulin resistance.""We undertook this study to compare adipose tissue lipolysis responses to insulin and niacin in humans.

41701547,2026-02-18,Obesity in Living Kidney Donors From Risk to Ethics: Bridging Gaps in Evaluation and Management.,"Obesity is increasingly prevalent among living kidney donor (LKD) candidates, presenting complex clinical, ethical, and logistical challenges. Although obesity is linked to increased post-donation hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease, the overall absolute risks are modest and may differ depending on metabolic health and patterns of fat distribution. Current reliance on body mass index (BMI) alone fails to capture the full spectrum of obesity-related risks, leading to inconsistent donor selection practices and potential inequities. This review examines the pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity-related kidney injury and available evidence on comorbidities and post-donation outcomes related to obesity. We discuss tools for better risk stratification, such as imaging-based adiposity assessment and personalized weight management strategies and note that some risks may remain after weight loss. Barriers such as rigid BMI cutoffs, limited access to treatment, and lack of long-term follow-up exacerbate disparities in access to donation. We argue for a shift toward individualized, risk-based evaluation supported by multidisciplinary care. We underscore the importance of donor counseling and advocate for a comprehensive, rather than paternalistic approach to LKD selection. Advancing safe and equitable living donation in the context of rising obesity rates will necessitate revised guidelines, improved access to treatment, and an ongoing commitment to donor well-being.Copyright © 2026 by the American Society of Nephrology.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,"Feb 17, 2026",2026.0,Feb,17.0,Pooja Budhiraja|Beata Bzoma|Aleksandar Denic|Naim Issa|Katie McKee|Carrie Schinstock|Sandra J Taler|Harini A Chakkera|Julie K Heimbach|Caroline C Jadlowiec|Kayla R Mirie|Diwan S Ty|Aleksandra Kukla,Pooja Budhiraja|Aleksandar Denic|Naim Issa|Katie McKee|Carrie Schinstock|Sandra J Taler|Harini A Chakkera|Julie K Heimbach|Caroline C Jadlowiec|Kayla R Mirie|Diwan S Ty|Aleksandra Kukla,"Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ.|Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland.|Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Living Kidney donor.|Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.","Pooja Budhiraja, Beata Bzoma, Aleksandar Denic, Naim Issa, Katie McKee, Carrie Schinstock, Sandra J Taler, Harini A Chakkera, Julie K Heimbach, Caroline C Jadlowiec, Kayla R Mirie, Diwan S Ty, Aleksandra Kukla",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701547/,"Obesity is a growing concern among living kidney donors, presenting complex clinical, ethical, and logistical challenges.

41467839,2026-02-18,"Interstrain recombinants of human cytomegalovirus uncouple glycoprotein display, virion infectivity, and spread characteristics.","A prevailing model holds that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) spreads cell-to-cell spread upon initial culturing from clinical specimens and that de novo mutations in the UL128-131 genes reduce expression of glycoprotein complex gH/gL/UL128-131 (pentamer) relative to gH/gL/gO (trimer), which in turn enhances virion infectivity and favors cell-free spread. The clone Merlin-BAC (ME) expresses far more pentamer than trimer and is highly cell-associated, whereas clone TB40-BAC4 (TB) expresses mostly trimer and spreads predominantly cell-free. A single G>T polymorphism in TB relative to ME was shown to impair UL128 mRNA splicing, reducing pentamer expression and enhancing infectivity and cell-free spread. However, enhanced cell-free spread of ME due to pentamer suppression did not come at the expense of efficient cell-to-cell spread, and cell-to-cell spread of TB was especially poor despite highly infectious intracellular virus. Most of the nucleotide diversity in the HCMV genome is due to 17 genes that have up to 14 alleles each, and TB and ME match at only two of the 17. Here, we report a set of recombinant HCMV generated by coinfecting cells with TB and ME. Trimer:pentamer ratio and virion infectivity largely aligned with the TB or ME UL128, with ""TB-like"" recombinants displaying more trimer and higher infectivity and ""ME-like"" recombinants displaying more pentamer and lower infectivity. Strikingly, some recombinants had shifts in preference for cell-free vs cell-to-cell spread without predicted changes to trimer:pentamer ratio or virion infectivity, demonstrating uncoupling of these phenotypes.IMPORTANCEThe emerging picture of HCMV genetic diversity in vivo prompts a reevaluation of how in vitro-characterized phenotypes, such as the abundance of different viral envelope glycoproteins, virion infectivity, and tendency toward cell-free or direct cell-to-cell spread, reflect viral characteristics in vivo. Laboratory examination of HCMV phenotypes has included a limited sampling of the apparent in vivo genetic diversity. A widely held model that directly links cell-free and cell-to-cell spread characteristics to glycoprotein display and virion infectivity also presumes that HCMV is predominantly cell-associated in vivo. These have implications for intervention strategies, such as calling into question the therapeutic benefit of neutralizing antibodies. Our finding that spread characteristics can be uncoupled from glycoprotein display and virion infectivity suggests a model that includes both cell-free and cell-associated spread as bona fide wild-type phenotypes for different allelic haplotypes. This model would allow a broader examination of neutralizing antibodies as correlates of protection.",Journal of virology,"Feb 17, 2026",2026.0,Feb,17.0,Christopher S Peterson|Ian T Bailey|Jean-Marc -M Lanchy|Ivan Gallego|Brent J Ryckman,Christopher S Peterson,"Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, USA.|Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Center for Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, USA.","Christopher S Peterson, Ian T Bailey, Jean-Marc -M Lanchy, Ivan Gallego, Brent J Ryckman",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467839/,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that can cause serious health issues, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

While the framework is a valuable contribution, the authors note that further research is needed to validate the model and understand its real-world application.",Surgery,Emergency Medicine
41707111,2026-02-19,How Are Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis and Endocytosis Affected in Parkinson Disease?,"Synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are 2 fundamental processes that involve the coordinated and timely activity of many proteins and protein-lipid interactions. Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) regulates several steps of these processes. Impaired exocytosis and endocytosis are important consequences of Parkinson disease (PD), reflecting both loss of function of normal α-Syn and toxic gain of function of abnormal α-Syn aggregates. Studies in familial forms of PD indicate that abnormal functions of other critical proteins such as leucine repeat rich kinase 2 also impair normal synaptic vesicular trafficking and contribute to synaptic dysfunction and secondary neurodegeneration.",Neurology,"Mar 24, 2026",2026.0,Mar,24.0,Eduardo Benarroch,Eduardo Benarroch,"From the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.",Eduardo Benarroch,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707111/,"Synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are crucial processes that enable communication between neurons.

41706878,2026-02-19,The human insula encodes somatotopic representation of motor execution with an effector-specific connectome map to primary motor cortex.,"Understanding motor representation in the human brain requires mapping beyond the primary motor cortex, into the distributed networks that coordinate complex movements. The insular cortex, a multifunctional hub buried within the Sylvian fissure, has been implicated in motor control through clinical observations and neuroimaging. Yet its precise relation to primary sensorimotor processing remains one of the least understood aspects of motor neurophysiology. To address this gap, we quantified electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes in patients performing simple movement tasks combined with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) to map effective connectivity. The movement data reveal somatotopically specific representation bilaterally, as well as intereffector regions that are active for different movement types. Hand representation is centered along the contralateral ventral aspect of the middle and posterior short gyri bilaterally, while tongue/mouth tuned sites cluster in the dorsal posterior short gyrus and the dorsal long gyri. Insular activity temporally follows the primary motor cortex (M1) and precedes movement onset. SPES revealed somatotopically specific connectivity between corresponding sites in M1 and insula (hand-to-hand, tongue-to-tongue) and between bilateral insulae. These observations establish that somatotopy is a conserved property of distributed motor control incorporating the insular representations and connectivity.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Feb 24, 2026",2026.0,Feb,24.0,Panagiotis Kerezoudis|Michael A Jensen|Bryan T Klassen|Gregory A Worrell|Nicholas M Gregg|Nuri F Ince|Jamie J Van Gompel|Dora Hermes|Kai J Miller,Panagiotis Kerezoudis|Michael A Jensen|Bryan T Klassen|Gregory A Worrell|Nicholas M Gregg|Nuri F Ince|Jamie J Van Gompel|Dora Hermes|Kai J Miller,"Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Division of Neuroscience, Mayo Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, MN 55905.|Medical Scientist Training Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.","Panagiotis Kerezoudis, Michael A Jensen, Bryan T Klassen, Gregory A Worrell, Nicholas M Gregg, Nuri F Ince, Jamie J Van Gompel, Dora Hermes, Kai J Miller",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41706878/,"The human insula, a complex brain region, plays a crucial role in motor control, but its precise relationship to the primary motor cortex has remained unclear.

41705720,2026-02-19,Patient-reported Barriers to On-Time Surveillance Following Successful Endoscopic Eradication of Barrett's Esophagus Neoplasia: A Multicenter Qualitative Interview Study.,"Ongoing surveillance after successful endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) for Barrett's esophagus (BE) related neoplasia is essential to detect and manage recurrence. Despite established surveillance interval recommendations after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM), patient compliance with repeat endoscopy is frequently suboptimal. Understanding patient drivers to adherence is essential to inform interventions that address the high rates of overdue surveillance and loss to follow-up.Patients with BE-related neoplasia who achieved CE-IM were eligible for inclusion and classified as delayed or on-time for endoscopic surveillance. Patients were prospectively enrolled and participated in structured virtual interviews designed to explore barriers and facilitators to on-time care. A rapid qualitative analysis approach was applied, continuing until thematic saturation was reached.Thirty-nine patients were interviewed: 22 (56.4%) were delayed, and 17 (43.6%) were on-time for surveillance. Patients in the delayed group had longer mean BE segment lengths and a higher prevalence of tobacco use. Geographic distance from the treatment center was the most frequently cited barrier to follow-up (n=17; 43.5%). Other common barriers were access limitations, financial concerns, misunderstanding of disease course, and test-related anxiety.Patient related drivers of delay in post-EET surveillance are largely logistical, socioeconomical, and psychological in nature. Solutions to reduce the significant burden on the patient and achieve timely surveillance may include transitioning patients back to their local endoscopists after CE-IM or incorporating non-endoscopic surveillance methods through patient centered approaches.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized VPS placement protocol by comparing indications and rates of shunt revision compared with a historical institutional cohort.All patients treated with VPS for ""suspected"" iNPH at a tertiary care center between January 2000 and January 2023 were retrospectively reviewed and divided into temporally distinct historical (before 2017) and standardized (after 2017) cohorts. Cumulative incidence and timing of VPS revision were compared using competing risks analyses.A total of 561 patients (median age 75.0 years) were identified with 324 (57.8%) in the historical and 237 (42.2%) in the standardized cohorts. Significant variations in surgical technique and shunt hardware were noted between the cohorts. With a median follow-up of 11.4 months for historical and 12.4 months for standardized cohort, shunt revisions occurred in 19.4% and 8.4% of patients in the historical and standardized cohorts, respectively (P < .001). Revision indications also varied significantly with lower rates of overdrainage (P < .001), infection (P < .001), and proximal malfunction (P = .042) but higher rate of distal malfunction (P = .03) in the standardized cohort. Notably, no infections were noted in the standardized cohort.Risk of shunt revision among iNPH patients may be associated with modifiable factors related to surgical technique and shunt hardware selection. Importantly, no short-term complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or catheter malposition were observed with the standardized protocol. Development and refinement of standardized shunt protocols for iNPH patients should be commonplace to facilitate tracking, identification, and modification of modifiable technical risk factors.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2026.

Half of the patients (n = 100) had surgery just before implementing patient-specific rods, and the other 100 patients had surgery immediately after adoption of patient-specific rods. All patients had instrumented fusions from the thoracic spine to the pelvis. Mechanical complications were defined as rod fracture, proximal junctional kyphosis, proximal junctional failure (revision surgery requiring proximal fusion extension), and/or revision surgery for rod fracture or pseudoarthrosis. Minimum follow-up was 2 years.A total of 200 patients were included with a median (IQR) age of 68 (61, 73), body mass index of 28 (25, 32), and 73% were female. The patients with patient-specific rods compared with those without had less preoperative kyphosis (39° vs 44°, P = .01), a higher median number of rods (4 vs 2, P = .04), more often a combined anterior-posterior approach (61% vs 46%, P = .047), more commonly a upper instrumented vertebra vertebroplasty (67% vs 45% P = .003), and postoperatively had less thoracic kyphosis (45% vs 49%, P = .02). Patient-specific rod patients had a lower rate of mechanical complications (29% vs 47%, P = .01), a lower rate of rod fracture (3% vs 16%, P = .003), and shorter operative times (215 minutes vs 250 minutes, P = .04). On multivariable analysis, the only 2 independent predictors of reducing the rate of mechanical complications were the utilization of patient-specific rods (odds ratio 0.47, P = .013, CI 0.26-0.85) and lower postoperative thoracic kyphosis (odds ratio 1.02, P = .04, CI 1.00-1.05).In a consecutive series of adult thoracolumbar spinal deformity patients, patient-specific rods reduced the odds of mechanical complications by over 50%.

We report the patterns of first-line care and outcomes for 720 patients with systemic PTCL enrolled in two related prospective cohort studies, LEO from 2015-2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02736357) and MER from 2002-2015, both followed through 2024. The primary endpoints were EFS and OS using Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression model. Secondary endpoints included correlations of clinical and treatment factors with survival. The most common induction regimens were CHOP-based (70%), given as CHOP (36%), CHOP plus etoposide (23%), or CHOP-like plus novel agents (11.5%, including 5% BV-CHP). Consolidative autologous stem cell transplant was performed in 102 patients (14%). Within nodal PTCL, EFS and OS were adversely associated with IPI 2-5 (HR=2.00, 95%CI: 1.59-2.52 for EFS; HR=2.44, 95%CI: 1.86-3.19 for OS), PIT 1-4 (HR=3.02, 95%CI 2.07-4.39 for EFS; HR=5.10, 95%CI 3.01-8.63 for OS), and non-ALCL subtypes (HR=2.97, 95%CI: 2.26-3.91 for EFS; HR=3.71, 95%CI: 2.65-5.20 for OS). Within LEO, which captured increasing first-line etoposide and BV, adding etoposide to CHOP was associated with better OS in ALK-negative ALCL (HR=0.14, 95%CI: 0.03-0.69, p=0.015). BV-CHP showed a trend toward OS improvement in ALCL (HR=0.15, 95%CI 0.02-1.19, p=0.073). Patients failing EFS6 and EFS24 had 5-year subsequent OS of 12% (95% CI: 7.8%, 19%) and 17% (95% CI: 13%, 22%), respectively. The inferior outcomes in non-ALCL subtypes and patients failing EFS6 and EFS24 highlight unmet needs with CHOP-based induction, where clinical trials with targeted therapy should be prioritized.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Feb 18, 2026",2026.0,Feb,18.0,Jia Ruan|Zhengming Chen|Melissa C Larson|N N Bennani|Pamela B Allen|Eric Mou|Danielle S Wallace|Neha Mehta-Shah|Izidore S Lossos|Luis E Malpica Castillo|David L Jaye|Francisco Vega|Giorgio G Inghirami|Georgios N Pongas|Neha Akkad|Carla Casulo|Peter Martin|Jonathon B Cohen|Thomas M Habermann|Matthew J Maurer|John P Leonard|Jonathan W Friedberg|Brad S Kahl|James R Cerhan|Christopher R Flowers|Andrew L Feldman,Melissa C Larson|N N Bennani|Danielle S Wallace|Carla Casulo|Thomas M Habermann|Matthew J Maurer|Jonathan W Friedberg|James R Cerhan|Andrew L Feldman,"Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.|University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States.|University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States.|Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.|University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States.|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.|Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States.|NYU Langone, New York, New York, United States.|NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, United States.|University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States.|Washington University in St. Louis, Staint Louis, Missouri, United States.|UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.","Jia Ruan, Zhengming Chen, Melissa C Larson, N N Bennani, Pamela B Allen, Eric Mou, Danielle S Wallace, Neha Mehta-Shah, Izidore S Lossos, Luis E Malpica Castillo, David L Jaye, Francisco Vega, Giorgio G Inghirami, Georgios N Pongas, Neha Akkad, Carla Casulo, Peter Martin, Jonathon B Cohen, Thomas M Habermann, Matthew J Maurer, John P Leonard, Jonathan W Friedberg, Brad S Kahl, James R Cerhan, Christopher R Flowers, Andrew L Feldman",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707114/,"This study aimed to characterize the current real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with systemic peripheral T-cell lymphoma, a rare and aggressive type of blood cancer.

Extramedullary disease (EMD), including both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS involvement, can also be associated with worse outcomes. The relationship between CRLF2r and EMD is unknown. Based on an initial observation of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) CRLF2r B-ALL and EMD, a single-center retrospective review was conducted to evaluate the incidence of EMD in CRLF2-r B-ALL patients. Across 177 children, adolescents, and young adults with r/r B-ALL, 21 (11.9%) harbored CRLF2r of whom 19 (90.5%) had EMD at some point during their treatment course. In contrast, only 78 of 156 (50%) patients without CRLF2r ever had EMD (p=0.0003). In the CRLF2r cohort, 8 (38.1%) presented with EMD at diagnosis: 7 with CNS and 1 with non-CNS EMD. At relapse, 17 (80.9%) had EMD: 4 (19%) had CNS-EMD, 9 (42.9%) had non-CNS-EMD and 4 (19%) had both. Isolated EMD was observed in 2 (11.8%) patients at first relapse and in 3 (17.6%) patients with multiple relapses.

As the organisation emerged from the global pandemic, Mayo Clinic recognised a need to transform its traditional, linear care model into a dynamic, platform-based approach to support its strategy. This required a new leadership model that could support and equip leaders with the skills needed to drive patient-centred healthcare transformation from within.To develop and validate a new leadership competency framework capable of supporting future-ready leadership.A multiphase, evidence-based approach was employed: (1) a visionary interview, goal setting and literature review; (2) focus groups with 23 leaders from across the organisation; (3) iterative competency framework development; and (4) a validation study involving a stratified sample of 129 physician leaders who rated competencies on importance and differentiation, and a qualitative verification by key stakeholders.Five core competencies with 23 behaviours were identified. The validation analysis established all behaviours as important for differentiating leadership performance. Stakeholder review confirmed the competencies were actionable and applicable across leadership roles at all levels.The Leads Self, Leads Others, Inspires Others, Forward Thinking and Engages Others (abbreviated LLIFE) competency model positions a healthcare organisation to advance leadership excellence in a rapidly evolving healthcare environment that requires comprehensive transformation. It aligns with strategic goals, embeds values-based behaviours and supports continuous development, establishing a model that other healthcare institutions may learn from and adapt.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

Consequently, in contrast to adults, pediatric MT remains an off-label intervention. This meta-analysis aimed to assess its safety and efficacy and compare outcomes with medical management (MM).MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to identify original studies reporting outcomes of MT, with or without intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in pediatric ischemic stroke. In studies that concurrently reported MT±IVT and MM±IVT within the same study, outcomes from the MM arms were also extracted for comparative analysis.Eighteen studies encompassing 612 pediatric patients were included. The pooled successful recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2b-3) after mechanical thrombectomy was 88.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.65 to 92.06), and 43.9% (95% CI, 38.67 to 49.09) achieved complete recanalization (TICI 3). Favorable functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) occurred in 78.6% (95% CI, 69.58 to 87.61) of patients, with mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rates of 3.9% (95% CI, 1.88 to 5.92) and 1.3% (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.58), respectively.

41708506,2026-02-19,Tissue Strain Mapping via Magnetic Resonance Elastography Can Be Used to Detect Active Lesion Expansion.,"Active lesion expansion is clinically important because it can indicate disease progression and influence management and treatment planning. However, sequential imaging is often unavailable, and rapid growth can only be inferred from indirect findings such as active perilesional tissue injury. This study aimed to implement and test the feasibility of an MR elastography (MRE)-based technique for assessing the expansile nature of mass lesions by detecting stiffness changes caused by mechanical strain manifestations in adjacent tissues.A tissue strain mapping (TSM) algorithm was developed using spatial-temporal directional filtering to reveal the presence of perilesional latent strain that is not apparent in conventional MRE inversions. The technical feasibility was tested in tissue-simulating phantoms containing a mass that was progressively expanded. Preliminary feasibility for clinical application was also demonstrated in representative in vivo examples. Resulting TSM maps were compared with conventional MRE stiffness maps.In the phantom experiments, TSM revealed the presence of local strain at the periphery of the expanding mass, with the effect increasing proportionally to the degree of expansion. Conventional MRE did not demonstrate comparable localized stiffening patterns. In vivo examples showed similar perilesional strain features that were not apparent on conventional MRE maps.The feasibility of the proposed MRE-based TSM technique was demonstrated in phantom and preliminary in vivo studies. These findings suggest that the technique is a promising tool for assessing the expansile nature of mass lesions and motivate further development of the TSM processing and exploration of potential clinical applications.© 2026 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",Magnetic resonance in medicine,"Feb 18, 2026",2026.0,Feb,18.0,Ziying Yin|David S Lake|Armando Manduca|John Huston|Richard L Ehman,Ziying Yin|David S Lake|Armando Manduca|John Huston|Richard L Ehman,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ziying Yin, David S Lake, Armando Manduca, John Huston, Richard L Ehman",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41708506/,"Active lesion expansion can indicate disease progression and influence treatment planning, but rapid growth is often difficult to detect.

41708563,2026-02-19,"Neuropathologic basis of quantitative susceptibility mapping in the substantia nigra: contributions of tau, pigmented neurons, and iron.","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) on MRI quantifies tissue magnetic susceptibility, which increases with iron accumulation, myelin loss, and neuroinflammation. Elevated QSM in the substantia nigra (SN) has been reported in Lewy body disease and other parkinsonian disorders, but from existing literature it remains unclear whether these findings are driven by neurodegeneration-related iron deposition or other neuropathologic features. We studied 59 autopsied participants who underwent antemortem 3 T MRI with QSM (median age at death, 78.5 years; MRI-to-death interval, 2.0 years), including clinical diagnoses of 18 with Alzheimer's-type dementia, 15 cognitively unimpaired, 9 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 with dementia with Lewy bodies. A machine learning-incorporated digital histopathology pipeline quantified tau burden, iron deposition, and neuronal densities. The SN was divided into geometric quadrants, and QSM values were analyzed in relation to corresponding neuropathologic measures within each quadrant. Iron deposition correlated with QSM in all quadrants (ρ = 0.41-0.56, all P < 0.005). Tau burden correlated with QSM in the ventromedial (VM) quadrant (ρ = 0.45, P = 0.002), whereas lower pigmented neuron density was associated with higher QSM in the dorsomedial quadrant (ρ = - 0.35, P = 0.007). Rank regression analysis confirmed iron as the strongest predictor of QSM across all quadrants (β = 0.35-1.06, P ≤ 0.026), with tau independently associated with QSM in the VM (β = 0.45, P = 0.015). Mediation analysis demonstrated that tau exerted direct (0.45, P = 0.018) and indirect effects via iron (0.12, P = 0.046) on QSM in the VM, with 80% of the effect being direct. These findings underscore the contributions of tau pathology, pigmented neuron density, and iron deposition to nigral magnetic susceptibility and highlight the potential for QSM to serve as a sensitive biomarker for diverse neuropathologies.© 2026.

However, visualization of the paraneurial layer, as a separate structure from the epineurium, remains challenging with conventional MRI, especially in the absence of pathology. This study evaluated the visualization of the paraneurium using ultra-high-field 7-Tesla (7 T) MRI compared to conventional field strengths. We assessed normal nerve anatomy and a spectrum of pathological cases, including intraneural ganglion cysts, schwannomas, intraneural perineuriomas, and metastatic melanoma. The results demonstrated that 7 T MRI provides superior resolution and delineation of the paraneurium compared to 1.5 and 3 T systems. In normal anatomy, T1-weighted and proton density (PD) sequences provided optimal contrast between the paraneurium and surrounding adipose tissue. In contrast, for pathological cases, T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression were superior for depicting the paraneurium and identifying subparaneurial involvement. In conclusion, 7 T MRI offers a significant advantage in identifying the thin paraneurial layer. This capability provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of tumor spread and holds promise for improving pre-operative planning and clinical decision-making in peripheral nerve pathology.© 2026 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)","Feb 18, 2026",2026.0,Feb,18.0,Nontaphon Piyawattanametha|Tomas Marek|Godard CW de Ruiter|Miguel A Reina|Kimberly K Amrami|Robert J Spinner,Nontaphon Piyawattanametha|Tomas Marek|Godard CW de Ruiter|Kimberly K Amrami|Robert J Spinner,"Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Neurosurgery Unit, Division of Surgery, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Anesthesiology, CEU-San-Pablo University School of Medicine, Madrid, Spain.|Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, USA.","Nontaphon Piyawattanametha, Tomas Marek, Godard CW de Ruiter, Miguel A Reina, Kimberly K Amrami, Robert J Spinner",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41708582/,"The paraneurium is a connective tissue sheath that surrounds the epineurium, and understanding its anatomy is clinically important for regional anesthesia and the spread of nerve pathologies.

41708750,2026-02-19,Low-affinity binding of anti-B7-H3 clone MJ18 to murine B7-H3 fails to induce tumor regression.,"The immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3 is regarded as one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of human cancers. B7-H3 is highly expressed in many cancers, and its expression has been associated to impaired antitumor immunity and poor patient prognosis. In immunocompetent mouse tumor models, genetic deletion of B7-H3 in tumor cells enhances antitumor immune response leading to tumor shrinkage. The underlying mechanisms of B7-H3 inhibitory function remain largely uncharacterized and the identity of potential cognate(s) receptor(s) of B7-H3 is still to be defined. To better understand B7-H3 function in vivo, several studies have employed MJ18, a monoclonal antibody reported to bind murine B7-H3 and blocks its immune-inhibitory function. In this brief research report, we show that MJ18 binds B7-H3 with very low affinity and does not induce tumor regression in three mouse models responsive to B7-H3 genetic deletion. Given the high profile of B7-H3 as a therapeutic target for human cancers, our work emphasizes that murine B7-H3 studies using the MJ18 antibody should be interpreted with caution. Finally, we hope that our study will motivate the scientific community to establish much-needed validated research tools to study B7-H3 biology in mouse models.© 2026.

Bronchoscopy remains the cornerstone for both histological confirmation and therapeutic intervention, offering minimally invasive access to the mediastinum, lung parenchyma and airways. This review integrates traditional techniques, including bronchoalveolar lavage, endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial biopsy, with advanced modalities such as endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, endobronchial ultrasound-guided intranodal forceps biopsy and mediastinal cryobiopsy. Emerging tools, including elastography and confocal laser endomicroscopy, are also explored for their potential to enhance diagnostic precision.

41709388,2026-02-20,Naloxone Training Among Sorority-Affiliated College Students: An Observational Study.,"As a population, college students are known to be at risk for adverse substance use-related events, such as opioid overdose, as they seek relief from academic and social stressors. Sorority affiliation in this population is reputed to be another risk factor for increased substance use and misuse. Many college students are not aware that illicitly made fentanyl is often mixed with other commonly used substances, such as marijuana and cocaine (among others), potentially leading to unintentional overdose and even death. The timely administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can save lives.This observational pre-post study examined college-age, sorority-affiliated students' knowledge of opioids, opioid toxicity, and opioid overdose response both before and after an educational lecture and hands-on naloxone training. Participants' perceptions about the intervention's effectiveness were also explored.Eighty-four participants completed a knowledge-assessment questionnaire prior to receiving a brief lecture about opioids. The investigators then gave a hands-on training, demonstrating proper overdose response procedures and intranasal naloxone administration using a low-fidelity simulation manikin. Participants were then given the optional opportunity to practice and submit a return demonstration, which was scored using a behavioral rubric. A posttest questionnaire identical to the first was administered following this training. Lastly, an intervention effectiveness survey was administered to assess participants' understanding of and comfort level in responding to opioid overdose events. Participant characteristics and perceptions of the training's effectiveness were summarized using descriptive statistics. Paired t tests were used to compare pre- and posttest means.Mean posttest total scores as well as posttest scores for individual components, including opioid knowledge, opioid toxicity, and opioid overdose response, were all significantly higher than mean pretest scores, indicating improvement following the hands-on training. The mean score on the behavioral rubric was 100 out of 100, indicating that of those participants who volunteered to practice and demonstrate responding to a simulated opioid overdose scenario, all responded correctly.This novel intervention, which combined didactic with hands-on learning methods, led to demonstrated improvements in knowledge of opioids, opioid toxicity, and opioid overdose response among sorority-affiliated college students. Routinely providing opioid education and practical hands-on naloxone training in college settings is recommended, and future studies should investigate students' long-term knowledge retention and real-world application of skills learned.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40966719,2026-02-20,Cortisol Testing to Diagnose Adrenal Insufficiency Following Adrenalectomy for Mild Autonomous Cortisol Secretion.,"Patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) can develop adrenal insufficiency after unilateral adrenalectomy.This work aimed to determine the prevalence, duration, and predictors of adrenal insufficiency, and compare postoperative basal cortisol and cosyntropin stimulation test (CST).In this multicenter retrospective study of patients with MACS, adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed when postoperative basal cortisol was less than 10 µg/dL and/or CST < 18 µg/dL. The results were concordant when both tests met cutoffs. Biochemical (BSS) and clinical severity scores (CSS) were calculated.Among 281 patients with MACS (80% women), postoperative adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed in 153 (54.5%) patients. Adrenal insufficiency inversely correlated with age (odds ratio [OR] 0.67 per 10 years; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84). Low basal cortisol and CST were associated with younger age (OR 0.64 per 10 years for both) and higher BSS (OR 1.17 and 1.22, respectively). Basal cortisol and CST were discordant in 22% of patients, and the discordance rate was more common in patients with bilateral nodules (32% vs 19%; P < .001). The median time to adrenal insufficiency recovery was 3.9 months (IQR, 3-5.9 months), with longer duration associated with higher BSS and CSS: 3 months for mild, 4 to 5 months for moderate, and 12 to 14 months for severe BSS and CSS.Approximately half of patients with MACS developed postoperative adrenal insufficiency, with 50% recovering by 3.9 months after surgery. BSS correlated with basal cortisol, CST, and duration of adrenal insufficiency. As discordant results were noted in 22%, performing both basal cortisol and CST postoperatively should be considered.© The Author(s) 2025.

Therefore, investigations of preventive methods are highly welcomed. Our goal was to conduct a systematic review of the literature about the use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema during breast cancer treatment. We hypothesized that identification of arm-draining lymph nodes may decrease the incidence of lymphedema.On October 7, 2019, we conducted a systematic review of studies in PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Answers, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, without time frame or language limitations, on the use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema during breast cancer treatment. We excluded articles that investigated other uses of lymphoscintigraphy, such as lymphedema diagnosis or treatment evaluation.Of 104 potential articles found in the literature, 5 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A total of 501 patients were included. Reverse mapping was done with radiography or single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Moreover, the examination was applied with different treatments, such as axillary lymph node dissection or radiotherapy, allowing preservation of noncompromised lymph nodes. Axillary reverse mapping also had prognostic value and was used with sentinel lymph node biopsy to identify patients at higher risk for lymphedema. Only one study compared the incidence of lymphedema between patients who received standard care or reverse mapping, showing significant benefits of its use.Use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema is feasible and seems to provide valuable information for breast cancer treatment.

Likely!,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to be the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. Despite the use of reninangiotensin system blockade, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists the risk of progression to ESKD and CV events persists in this high-risk population. For this reason, new or combined strategies for treating persons with CKD and DM are in constant development. This editorial discusses the results of a recent published trial, Combination Effect of Finerenone and Empagliflozin (EMP) in Participants with Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Using a Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) Endpoint (CONFIDENCE) in persons with DM and CKD focused in the mechanisms involved in the beneficial renal effect in terms of albuminuria reduction[1]. Whether there is related to the synergistic effect of the combination therapy (EMP + finerenone) or merely a manifestation secondary to systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction remains to be determined[2].The CONFIDENCE trial, a double-blind, multicenter, study involving 800 patients with type 2 DM and CKD (eGFR 30 to 90 ml/min/1.73m 2 and urinary albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) 100 to < 5000 mg/g) tested the effect of combining finerenone and EMP on reducing albuminuria compared with monotherapy with either empagliflozin or finerenone alone, over 180 days. All patients were on maximum tolerated angiotensin II blockade at baseline. The primary endpoint was the relative change in the log-transformed mean UACR from baseline to 180 days, a surrogate marker for kidney disease progression in previous meta-analysis [3].© The Author(s) 2026.

Improving AMT triage is limited by a lack of evidence and a standardized definition for which patients and circumstances may warrant AMT. Our objective was to develop a consensus-based definition of AMT need.We recruited a multidisciplinary, nationally representative panel with expertise in AMT from trauma surgery, anesthesiology, critical care, emergency medicine, and emergency medical services (EMS). Panelists were presented with criteria from the literature representing the potential for AMT need that included patient injuries, time-sensitive interventions, and system factors. Panelists voted over 4 rounds to refine and select (≥70% agreement) a final set of criteria using a web-based Delphi methodology, including potential criteria combinations.A total of 32 of 45 (71.1%) invited panelists agreed to participate. From 66 initial criteria, panelists reached consensus on 18 patient factors, 6 time-sensitive interventions, 3 system factors, and 7 combinations of criteria. Two key themes emerged: the need for specialized care from air medical crews that may not be available from ground ambulance clinicians, as well as overall prehospital time-savings. After narrative feedback and refinement to eliminate redundant and overlapping criteria, an algorithm for AMT need was developed along with a decision flow diagram suitable for educational dissemination.We developed a consensus-based definition of AMT need for trauma patients that can be operationalized for AMT triage. Further validation of this concept with patient outcomes and identifying implementation barriers will contribute to field deployment of a useful AMT triage tool for EMS clinicians.",Prehospital emergency care,"Feb 19, 2026",2026.0,Feb,19.0,Joshua B Brown|Rebecca E Cash|Liling Lu|Leonard Weiss|Justin Beal|Matthew Kravetsky|Michael O'Brien|Jason Sperry|Bryan E Bledsoe|David V Shatz|Mark L Gestring|Andrew Cathers|Kaori Tanaka|Gregory J Jurkovich|Brian K Yorkgitis|Brian Clemency|Andrew Latimer|Ben Lawner|John Lyng|Bryan Nelson|Eileen M Bulger|Joshua Stilley|Ryan Wubben|Theodore R Delbridge|Jason Cohen|Nicholas H George|Johanna Innes|Doug Swanson|Eric A Bank|Christian Martin-Gill|Francis X Guyette,Mark L Gestring,"Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY.|STAT MedEvac, Center for Emergency Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Nevada School of Medicine, Las Vegas, NV.|Department of Surgery, UC Davis Health, Sacramento, CA.|Department of Surgery and Emergency Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY.|Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.|Department of Emergency Medicine, North Memorial Health, Robbinsdale, MN.|Clinical Quality Professional, Lehigh Valley Health Network, Allentown, PA.|Department of Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO.|Office of the Executive Director, Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems (MIEMSS), Baltimore, MD.|Boston MedFlight, Bedford, MA.|Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service, NSW Health, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Charlotte, NC.|Harris County Emergency Services District No. 48, Katy, TX.","Joshua B Brown, Rebecca E Cash, Liling Lu, Leonard Weiss, Justin Beal, Matthew Kravetsky, Michael O'Brien, Jason Sperry, Bryan E Bledsoe, David V Shatz, Mark L Gestring, Andrew Cathers, Kaori Tanaka, Gregory J Jurkovich, Brian K Yorkgitis, Brian Clemency, Andrew Latimer, Ben Lawner, John Lyng, Bryan Nelson, Eileen M Bulger, Joshua Stilley, Ryan Wubben, Theodore R Delbridge, Jason Cohen, Nicholas H George, Johanna Innes, Doug Swanson, Eric A Bank, Christian Martin-Gill, Francis X Guyette",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41712185/,"Air medical transport (AMT) can improve survival for certain trauma patients, but there is a lack of evidence and standardized criteria for determining when AMT is needed.

41712219,2026-02-20,Treatment for Brain Metastases With Stereotactic Radiation vs Hippocampal-Avoidance Whole Brain Radiation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Brain metastases are common in patients with cancer, and radiation is often used for management. Among patients with more than 4 brain metastases, the effects of stereotactic radiation targeting only individual tumors, compared with whole brain radiation with hippocampal avoidance, which radiates both tumors and normal brain, remain unknown.To determine whether stereotactic radiation improves symptom severity and interference with daily functioning, compared with whole brain radiation with hippocampal avoidance.Phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 United States-based centers. Eligible patients had 5 to 20 brain metastases and no prior brain-directed radiation. Enrollment occurred between April 11, 2017, and May 17, 2024 (final follow-up, March 18, 2025).Stereotactic radiation, compared with whole brain radiation with hippocampal avoidance.Mean weighted patient-reported symptom severity and interference score change over 6 months postbaseline relative to baseline using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor instrument (scale, 0-10; score change range, -10 to 10; -10 = best). A clinically meaningful Δ was defined as 0.98.Of 196 randomized patients (mean age, 61 years; 129 [66%] female; 176 [90%] White; median number of brain metastases, 14 [IQR, 11-18]; 49 [25%] with prior neurosurgical resection), 83 (42%) completed the 6-month assessment. For the primary outcome, between baseline and postbaseline assessments through the 6-month follow-up, stereotactic radiation changed the weighted composite MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor score from 2.69 to 2.37 (mean change, -0.32) and hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation changed the score from 2.29 to 3.03 (mean change, 0.74) (mean difference, -1.06 [95% CI, -1.54 to -0.58]; P < .001). Related grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 12 patients (12%) in the stereotactic radiation group and 13 patients (13%) in the hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation group; grade 1-3 fatigue was most frequent (27 [28%] vs 43 [44%], respectively).In patients with 5 to 20 brain metastases, these findings support stereotactic radiation over hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation to improve symptoms and interference with daily functioning, key components of quality of life.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03075072.",JAMA,"Feb 19, 2026",2026.0,Feb,19.0,Ayal A Aizer|Kee-Young Y Shin|Paul J Catalano|Ivy Ricca|Marciana Johnson|Grant Benham|Kristin Roper|Beverly Spicer|Eileen Mann|Jennifer Nosker|Michael W Parsons|Mallika L Mendu|Jaroslaw Hepel|Fallon Chipidza|Monica Krishnan|Diana D Shi|Nayan Lamba|Itai Pashtan|Luke Peng|Brian Alexander|Paul D Brown|Patrick Y Wen|Daphne A Haas-Kogan|Rifaquat Rahman|Shyam Tanguturi,Paul D Brown,"Department of Radiation Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Increasing CO was associated with more intensive vasodilator use (triple therapy 11/19/33%,p=0.0008), with progressively lower PVR (p<0.0001). High output was associated with the lowest systemic vascular resistance (p<0.0001), with greater LV and LA enlargement (p<0.001 for all). High flow resulted in increase in LV and RV work at rest, and absolute/relative RV work during exercise (p<0.0001 for all). Despite greater exercise O2 delivery (p<0.0001), peripheral O2 utilization was impaired by O2 extraction ratio (p=0.001) and AVO2 difference (p=0.005), without incremental functional or survival benefit compared to normal output PH. After adjusting for baseline risk, high output had increased risk of death/transplant compared to normal output [adjusted HR 2.1 (95% 1.2-3.7), p=0.007]. In a validation cohort (n=37), 93% had normal CO at diagnosis, with the high output state developing in follow-up after vasodilator initiation.1 in 10 patients with group 1 PH has a high output state which is most common in prevalent PH and related to vasodilator intensity, with adverse cardiac remodeling and myocardial workload. Further studies are needed to determine optimal vasodilator dosing with high output, and therapeutic interaction with vasodilator sparing therapies such as sotatercept.Copyright ©The authors 2025.

41714438,2026-02-20,Pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic drug mood stabilizer treatment response in bipolar disorder: A MoStGen Consortium study.,"Identifying biological and clinical factors associated with response to mood-stabilizing medications is critical for improving bipolar disorder (BD) treatment. The Mood Stabilizer Genomics (MoStGen) Consortium was established to investigate pharmacogenomic and clinical predictors of response to treatment of BD with antiepileptic drug mood stabilizers (AMS). Here we present the first pharmacogenomic analyses of AMS treatment outcomes based on MoStGen Consortium data, including 917 individuals across contributing sites. We performed genome-wide association analyses in subcohorts followed by meta-analyses, with AMS treatment response measured quantitatively using the Alda scale. Medication-stratified analyses were performed for valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG) treatment response. Additionally, polygenic score (PGS) analyses were used to evaluate the overall genetic contribution to AMS response across cohorts and to test whether genetic liability for various neuropsychiatric illnesses impacts AMS response. We detected genome-wide significant associations with LTG treatment response for SNPs in the gene ROBO2 (top SNP: rs985123, p = 1.9E-10) and for POLR1E at the gene-level (p = 2.53E-06). No significant associations were found for overall AMS or VPA treatment response. Leave-one-out PGS analyses provided significant evidence for a polygenic signal for AMS treatment response. Furthermore, the epilepsy PGS was nominally significantly associated with AMS response (p = 0.024), suggesting higher genetic liability to epilepsy predicts a better response to treatment with AMS. These findings provide insights into the genetic contribution to AMS treatment outcomes, and in particular LTG response, and may contribute to the development of more precise treatments for BD.© 2026.

41714516,2026-02-20,Beta-Blockers After Myocardial Infarction Without Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Meta-Analysis of Kaplan-Meier Reconstructed Individual Patient Data.,"The long-term benefit of beta-blockers (β-blockers) after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 40%) remains uncertain in the modern reperfusion era. Earlier trials showed mortality benefits, but contemporary therapies may have altered their effect.We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing β-blockers versus no β-blockers in adults with MI and LVEF ≥ 40%. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched through October 2025. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, and heart failure (HF). Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed from Kaplan-Meier curves for time-to-event analysis, and pooled risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using random-effects models. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), meta-regression, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) certainty assessments were performed.Five RCTs (n = 23,524 patients) met inclusion criteria. β-Blockers did not significantly reduce recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (HR: 0.89 with 95% confidence interval [CI 0.78, 1.02], P = 0.1), HF (HR: 0.92 with 95% CI [0.71, 1.20], P = 0.54), and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.97 with 95% CI [0.85, 1.10], P = 0.63). Secondary endpoints-including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, stroke, and revascularization-were neutral (P > 0.05). TSA boundaries were not crossed, and meta-regression identified no significant effect modifiers. Evidence certainty was rated low to moderate.Among patients with MI and preserved LVEF, β-blockers did not reduce mortality or ischemic or HF events. Routine long-term use offers no prognostic advantage and should be reserved for specific indications such as reduced LVEF, angina, arrhythmia, or hypertension.International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) identifier no.

40968013,2026-02-20,The Diagnostic Burden of Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension: Imaging Volume and Specialists' Involvement Prior to Diagnosis.,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a disabling condition that is frequently underdiagnosed as a result of diagnostic challenges. Delays in diagnosis can be attributed to under-recognized MRI findings or a lack of clinical suspicion, given the wide range of symptoms. This study aims to explore the diagnostic burden of SIH by examining the number of imaging examinations and clinician visits before diagnosis.This retrospective single-institution study included 71 patients with spinal CSF leaks who had a confirmed diagnosis of CSF-venous fistula (CVF) on digital subtraction myelography (DSM). We reviewed each patient's clinical history, including the number of providers in different specialties and institutions, as well as the number and type of imaging studies performed before the positive DSM at our center. Brain MR images were scored using the Bern criteria, and clinical history, along with imaging data, were compared across Bern groups (low, intermediate, high probability).The mean patient age was 57.6 years, with most being women (65%). The mean duration of symptoms was 3.8 years, and 14.1% of patients experienced symptoms for ≥10 years before the positive DSM. The mean number of specialists seen per patient was 2.6 (SD: 2.7; range, 0-13), and 28% of patients consulted 4 or more specialists before the positive DSM. On average, each patient underwent 6 imaging studies (SD: 3.8; range: 2-22) before the DSM, including 5.3 MRIs (SD: 3.7; range: 2-22), and 2.5 brain MRIs (SD: 2.1; range: 1-11). The percentage of patients who underwent ≥7 total imaging studies was 40.8%, and 53.5% had ≥3 brain MRIs before diagnosis. Though no statistically significant differences were found in the mean number of specialists or imaging examinations between Bern score groups, a trend of increasing diagnostic burden was observed from the high to low Bern score groups.Patients with spinal CSF leaks often undergo an extensive number of imaging and specialty consultations, contributing to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This study highlights the need to increase awareness among health care providers regarding the typical symptoms and imaging features of spinal CSF leaks.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41712602,2026-02-20,Alterations in the CTRB2 gene and response to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a highly fatal malignancy due partly to treatment resistance in many patients. We previously identified a functional germline deletion overlapping exon 6 of CTRB2 (CTRB2ex6) at a PDAC genome-wide risk locus on chr16q23.1. This variant leads to a nonfunctional truncated chymotrypsin protein that accumulates intracellularly and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we performed a retrospective study to determine whether CTRB2ex6 deletions are associated with response to chemotherapy, time to cancer progression, or overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients.The study included CTRB2 genotype data from two independent PDAC cohorts (Cohort 1: n = 633; Cohort 2: n = 3,896). We examined associations between CTRB2ex6 deletion status and OS and time-to-progression (TTP) using Cox proportional hazard modeling. TTP was also evaluated in a subset of chemotherapy-treated patients in Cohort 1 (n = 263) to determine the impact of CTRB2ex6 deletion status on chemotherapy response.CTRB2ex6 deletions were found in 20% of patients in both cohorts combined (19% in Cohort 1, and 21% in Cohort 2). No significant difference was observed in OS by CTRB2 deletion status in either cohort (Cohort 1: HR = 0.95, p = 0.60; Cohort 2: HR = 1.04, p = 0.43). Among chemotherapy-treated patients in Cohort 1, CTRB2 deletion carriers had a longer median TTP (20.4 vs. 12 months), though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.49). Homozygous deletion carriers had the longest TTP (70 months).No clinical impact on chemotherapy response or OS was observed by CTRB2 deletion status. Further studies are needed to identify reliable biomarkers of therapy response in PDAC.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

41694488,2026-02-21,Lactate metabolism-driven tumor heterogeneity and molecular signatures in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly aggressive liver malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recent evidence indicates that lactate metabolism (LM) plays a pivotal role in tumor metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and disease progression; however, the heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms of LM activity within ICC remain largely undefined.To systematically characterize LM-driven heterogeneity and its molecular and functional implications in ICC.Single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk transcriptomic datasets were integrated to characterize LM heterogeneity in ICC. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis and multiple machine-learning algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, random forest, gradient boosting machine, adaptive best subset selection, and decision tree) were employed to identify LM-associated feature genes. CytoTRACE and CellChat analyses were used to assess differentiation potential and intercellular communication among malignant epithelial subpopulations. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed to elucidate biological functions. A random forest model combined with SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) interpretability analysis identified the most predictive LM-related gene. Functional assays, including quantitative polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound-healing, and transwell experiments, were conducted to validate CYC1 in ICC cell lines.Malignant ICC cells were stratified into three LM-activity subtypes (high, intermediate, and low) exhibiting distinct transcriptional programs and differentiation trajectories. Twelve LM-associated feature genes GPX3, CYC1, NME1, GSTP1, MGST1, ALDH3A1, TALDO1, SNRPB, TKT, NAA20, G6PD, and RPL13A were identified as key molecular markers linked to aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Among them, CYC1 showed the highest predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.844) and strongest model contribution (SHAP = 0.091), marking it as the principal LM-related driver gene. Functional experiments confirmed that CYC1 knockdown significantly suppressed ICC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, validating its oncogenic role in promoting malignant progression.This integrative single-cell and machine-learning study delineates the molecular heterogeneity of LM in ICC and identifies twelve feature genes linking LM with tumor aggressiveness. These findings provide novel insight into LM-driven oncogenic mechanisms and propose CYC1 and other LM-associated genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ICC.©The Author(s) 2026.

Using normal sinus rhythm ECG, our institution has developed AI-ECG models that predict the probability of AF and estimate patients' age, and from that, delta age (estimated age minus actual age) has been shown to reflect cardiovascular health and physiologic aging.We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with migraine who had at least one digital, standard 12-lead ECG from 2000 to 2020 at any Mayo Clinic site. The first normal sinus rhythm ECG was defined as the index ECG, and those with adverse vascular events or AF prior to, or within 3 days after, index ECG were excluded. AI-ECG AF prediction model output and delta age were obtained from the index ECG. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of adverse vascular events that included acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and death. New-onset AF was also recorded as a secondary outcome.A total of 29,928 patients were included. The mean age was 44.3 ± 14.5 years, and the median follow-up time was 54 months. During the study period, 4662 (15.6%) patients had adverse vascular events, and 1384 (4.6%) patients developed new-onset AF. A higher AF prediction model output was associated with a higher risk of adverse vascular outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:1.15 [95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.18] for every 10% increase in prediction model output), as was a larger delta age (aHR:1.16 [1.12 to 1.21] for every 10-year increase in delta age). Moreover, AI-ECG AF prediction model outputs of ≥1% (aHR: 1.45 [1.36 to 1.54]) and delta age ≥-1 years (aHR: 1.09 [1.02 to 1.16]) were found to be the optimal cutoffs to dichotomize patients into high-risk and low-risk groups for adverse vascular events. Higher AI-ECG AF prediction model output at baseline also predicted a higher likelihood of having new-onset AF during the study period (aHR: 1.31 [1.26 to 1.37]), and the development of new-onset AF was associated with a higher risk of adverse vascular events (aHR: 2.43 [2.17 to 2.73]).For patients with migraine, a higher AI-ECG AF prediction model output and delta age are predictive of adverse vascular outcomes. A higher AF prediction model output is also predictive of future AF development. Furthermore, we identified the cutoffs for both AI-ECG models that can distinguish patients between high- and low-risk groups. Our results showed that AI-ECG models could inform clinical practice and identify patients with migraine at risk for future adverse vascular events.© 2026 American Headache Society.",Headache,"Feb 20, 2026",2026,Feb,20,Ping-Hao H Yang|Nan Zhang|Chieh-Ju J Chao|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Kathryn E Mangold|Itzhak Z Attia|Paul A Friedman|Peter A Noseworthy|Gretchen E Tietjen|Chia-Chun C Chiang,Ping-Hao H Yang|Nan Zhang|Chieh-Ju J Chao|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Kathryn E Mangold|Itzhak Z Attia|Paul A Friedman|Peter A Noseworthy|Chia-Chun C Chiang,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Research, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Neurology, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio, USA.","Ping-Hao H Yang, Nan Zhang, Chieh-Ju J Chao, Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, Kathryn E Mangold, Itzhak Z Attia, Paul A Friedman, Peter A Noseworthy, Gretchen E Tietjen, Chia-Chun C Chiang",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41721210/,"This medical research paper investigates the ability of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) models to predict adverse vascular outcomes in patients with migraine.

41719457,2026-02-21,Characteristics Associated with Clinical Response to Pomalidomide in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) results in recurrent severe epistaxis, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, and other morbid manifestations. Pomalidomide was recently demonstrated to be efficacious for bleeding in HHT in the landmark PATH-HHT trial. Given that the vascular remodeling that results in bleeding improvement may require several months, characteristics associated with treatment response would be invaluable to plan treatment. Using data from PATH-HHT (NCT03910244), we identified characteristics associated with change from baseline in Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS, a well-validated 10-point HHT bleeding scale and the trial's primary endpoint) using multivariable-adjusted repeated measures models. Characteristics associated with a better response to pomalidomide at weeks 16-24 of the trial included a higher (more severe) baseline ESS (change from baseline, -0.76 [95% CI -0.99,-0.54] points per 1 point higher baseline score, P<0.001) and concomitant antifibrinolytic therapy (-0.73 [95% CI -1.48, 0.01] vs. no therapy, p=0.05). Characteristics associated with a less robust response were older age (0.29 [95% CI 0.05, 0.53] per 10 years older, P=0.02) and underlying ACVRL1 germline mutation (0.62 [95% CI -0.04,1.27] vs. ENG, SMAD4 or mutation not known, p=0.06]. Characteristics notably associated with placebo response (placebo effect) were patient-reported outcome measures, such that those experiencing more severe disease at baseline had less placebo effect. In conclusion, several baseline patient and disease characteristics were associated with pomalidomide response, findings that may help guide patient selection for the use of pomalidomide in HHT.

41719404,2026-02-21,Evidence that extra copies of chromosome 1q play a role in the early phases of pancreatic neoplasia.,"We searched for oncogenes activated by copy number increases using whole-genome sequencing data of 535 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We found that gains of 1q were the second most common gain, occurring in 213 (39.8%) of PDACs. Single-cell analysis via fluorescence in situ hybridization on 33 cancers confirmed these results. A portion of 1q, rather than the entire 1q arm, was gained in 75 (14.0%) PDACs, allowing us to pinpoint two ~3-megabase regions of 1q that were nearly always gained. These two regions contained NCSTN and PSEN2, genes that code two subunits of the γ-secretase complex. Evaluation of 267 precancerous lesions revealed that extra copies of NCSTN and PSEN2 were common (49%) in noninvasive neoplasms (high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms), which are at relatively high risk for progression to PDACs, but uncommon (6%) in low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, which have low malignant potential.

Researchers analyzed genetic data from over 500 pancreatic tumors and found that extra copies of a specific region on chromosome 1 were common, occurring in nearly 40% of cases. Further investigation revealed that this region contained two genes involved in the gamma-secretase complex, which plays a role in cell signaling. Interestingly, these genetic changes were also observed in precancerous lesions, suggesting they may be an early event in the development of pancreatic cancer. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of pancreatic neoplasia, which could inform the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Oncology,
41719162,2026-02-21,Association of patient complexity with information processing and usability of electronic health records among ICU providers: a multicenter study.,"This study aimed to evaluate how differences in case complexity affect information-processing burden, as measured by eye-tracking, as well as the efficiency of electronic health record (EHR) use among healthcare providers in the intensive care unit.This cross-sectional study recruited providers from 4 U.S. medical centers that use 2 prominent EHR systems (Epic and Oracle). After reporting demographic information, participants reviewed 2 complex cases and 2 standard cases in their institution's EHR system and then responded to 5 questions about each case, yielding a performance score. Information-processing burden was assessed by measuring the number of eye fixations via eye-tracking software. The efficiency of EHR use was assessed by measuring the task completion time, number of mouse clicks per minute, number of EHR screens viewed, and performance score.Eighty-one providers were included for analysis. Providers exhibited significantly more eye fixations (P < .001) and longer task completion times (P < .001) for complex cases than for standard cases. There were also significantly fewer mouse clicks per minute during complex cases (P < .001). Reviewing a complex case first led to significantly more eye fixations (P = .015) and longer task completion times (P < .01) than when a standard case was presented first. Case complexity did not significantly affect performance scores or the number of EHR screens viewed.Higher case complexity was shown to be associated with greater information-processing burden and less efficient EHR use. These findings have implications for enhancing the efficiency of EHR use, thereby leading to improved clinical decision-making and patient safety. Furthermore, reviewing complex cases first led to a greater information-processing burden, suggesting that providers could benefit from ""warming up"" with standard cases before reviewing complex cases.© The Author(s) 2026.

41719116,2026-02-21,Positive Predictive Value and Breast Cancer Histology by the Method of Detection Across a Multistate Health Care Enterprise.,"To compare the pathology outcomes of image-guided breast biopsies across a multistate health care enterprise by the method of detection (MOD), including the positive predictive value (PPV3) and histological types.Biopsies from October 31, 2017, to July 6, 2023, across 18 imaging sites in 4 states were extracted. Radiologists prospectively assigned MODs, including symptomatic presentations (self-examination, clinical examination) and imaging modalities (mammogram, tomosynthesis, US, MRI, contrast-enhanced mammogram, molecular breast imaging, other imaging). For each MOD, the rates of malignancy and cancer subtypes were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.In 26 932 biopsies on 22 582 patients (mean age 57.6 years ± 14.2 [SD]; 22 416 women), 6068 (81.1%) cancers were detected by screening, and 1144 (15.3%) were detected by symptoms. Symptomatic presentation MODs had a higher PPV3 (43.0% vs 25.6%; P < .001), larger cancer lesion sizes (x̄ = 27.5 mm vs x̄ = 17.8 mm; P < 001), and a higher association with invasive carcinoma (96.7% vs 76.8%; P <.001) compared with screening imaging-based MODs. Methods of detection with higher PPV3s also tended to have higher rates of invasive carcinoma (Spearman's ρ = 0.83).Compared with breast cancers detected after symptomatic presentations, those identified via image-based screening were smaller and less often invasive, confirming the value of screening in early detection. Positive predictive value and the rate of invasive carcinoma varied in parallel across MODs.© Society of Breast Imaging 2026. All rights reserved.

41717958,2026-02-21,Diels-Alder Click Chemistry as a Dynamic-Covalent Crosslinking Method in Spheroid-Encapsulating Hydrogels for Cartilage Engineering.,"In cartilage tissue engineering, there is a growing interest in dynamic hydrogels that promote spheroid fusion and cartilaginous matrix deposition, while maintaining sufficient stability for long-term construct maturation. In this study, Diels-Alder click chemistry is employed as a dynamic-covalent crosslinking method to create hydrogels composed of hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and PEG. By adjusting the pH during crosslinking, the tuneability of hydrogel stiffness and stability at pH values around the physiological pH of native cartilage is demonstrated. This pH modulation does not compromise hydrogel functionality, as encapsulated equine articular cartilage progenitor cell spheroids remain viable and functional for a culture period of 28 days. The hydrogel environment supports the deposition of cartilaginous extracellular matrix components, including collagens and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Enhanced chondrogenesis and deposition of collagen type II are observed at higher spheroid concentrations, corresponding to inter-spheroid distances of 100-150 µm following hydrogel swelling, compared to lower concentrations at a distance of >500 µm. To further improve construct robustness, the hydrogel constructs can be reinforced on day 1 with a melt electrowritten scaffold, increasing the compressive modulus 100-fold by day 28 compared to non-reinforced constructs, highlighting the potential of this system for engineering cartilage implants.© 2026 The Author(s).

41717947,2026-02-21,Inadequate Preventive Dental Care Is Associated With Higher Cardiovascular Risk Identified by ECG-Based Artificial Intelligence Algorithms.,"Inadequate preventive dental care may contribute to inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis, increasing cardiovascular disease risk. Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) algorithms accurately estimate cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated the association between inadequate preventive dental care and the AI-ECG-estimated risk of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, cardiac amyloid, cardiovascular aging, and all-cause mortality.We retrospectively analyzed 266 637 Mayo Clinic patients (2018-2024) who completed a Social Determinants of Health Survey and had an ECG performed within 1 year of survey completion. AI-ECG algorithms generated continuous risk scores (0 or 1) for atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, and amyloid. Cardiac aging was assessed by delta age, calculated as AI-ECG-estimated physiological age minus the chronological age. Associations with preventive dental care were analyzed using logistic regression. Cox regression evaluated dental care predictiveness on all-cause mortality.Among 266 637 individuals (mean age, 59.5±16.4 years; 51.1% women), 49 918 (18.7%) reported inadequate preventive dental care. These individuals had higher delta age and increased AI-ECG-predicted risks of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, amyloid, and reduced ejection fraction (all P<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression models including all AI-ECG scores, inadequate preventive dental care was associated with higher probabilities of low ejection fraction (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.69-1.91]), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.04-1.17]), aortic stenosis (OR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.64-2.20]), amyloid (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.25]), and higher delta age (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03]) (all P<0.001). Inadequate preventive dental care predicted all-cause mortality after adjusting for demographics, risk factors, and AI-ECG algorithms (HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.38-1.53], P<0.001).Inadequate preventive dental care is associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease.

41717695,2026-02-21,Variation in Lipid Management for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Across US Health Systems.,"While health systems have implemented resources to improve lipid management in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the population-level effectiveness is unclear.Electronic health record data from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2023, across 16 US academic health systems were analyzed. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (defined by diagnosis and procedure codes) was established on or before the index date defined as the date of the most recent LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) or the last day of the study period for those without an LDL-C available. Systems were surveyed to identify lipid management programs (eg, prevention/lipid clinic, electronic health record-based tools, and lipid management algorithms). Sequential multilevel multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to (1) assess the system-level association between an LDL-C <70 mg/dL and the presence of lipid management programs, adjusting for patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics, and (2) whether system-level uptake of statin or nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy was associated with an LDL-C <70 mg/dL.We included 1 738 042 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (median, 88 365 per system; range, 17 086-2 48 371). About 81% of the health systems had prevention or lipid clinics. The proportion of those on statins ranged from 31.0% to 60.4% across health systems (median, 46.3%). Lower proportions were observed in the use of high-intensity statins (16.2%-33.1%), nonstatins (2.6%-8.1%), and combination lipid-lowering therapy (1.7%-6.3%). Among those with an LDL-C level available (n=890 521), 42.5% had an LDL-C <70 mg/dL, ranging 35.8% to 49.4% across systems. There was no association between the odds of achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL and health system lipid management algorithm, prevention clinics/lipid clinics, or electronic health record-based tools. Neither system-level high-intensity statin utilization nor nonstatin use was associated with an LDL-C <70 mg/dL.Despite variability in lipid management resources and lipid-lowering therapy use across systems, many did not reach an LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and there was low uptake of lipid-lowering therapy.
