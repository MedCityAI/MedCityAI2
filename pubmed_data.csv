41359838,Mapping epileptogenic brain using a unified spatial-temporal-spectral source imaging framework.,"Noninvasive electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) is a valuable tool for localizing and imaging brain activity, with significant potential to aid presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy (fDRE) patients. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, including interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures, each offer unique capabilities in estimating the epileptogenic zone (EZ). However, there is a limited quantitative understanding of how these biomarkers differ in source-imaging precision, requiring distinct processing pipelines. Here, we developed a spatial-temporal-spectral imaging (STSI) framework for precision source imaging, and quantitatively evaluated various epilepsy biomarkers for source imaging in 2,081 individual events (spikes, HFOs, and seizures) from a cohort of 42 fDRE patients, comparing results to clinical ground truth such as surgical resection outcomes and intracranial EEG-defined seizure onset zones. The STSI enabled quantitative comparisons across key EEG epilepsy-related biomarkers, with averaged localization errors of 6.67 mm for seizures, 8.73 mm for HFOs overlapping with spikes (pHFO), 10.28 mm for HFO-riding spikes (pSpike), 19.59 mm for general spikes (aSpike), and 36.53 mm for general HFOs (aHFO), respectively, for seizure-free patients. These findings indicate that HFOs overlapping with spikes is the most spatially accurate interictal biomarker for mapping the EZ. The proposed STSI framework not only establishes a unified analysis approach for epileptic biomarkers to enhance presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy, but could also generalize as a versatile tool for mapping event-related potentials, neural oscillations, and dynamic brain states, within a single framework to advance cognitive neuroscience research and clinical management of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Dec 16, 2025",2025,Dec,16,Jiang X|Cai Z|Gonsisko C|Worrell G A|He B,Worrell G A,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.","Jiang X, Cai Z, Gonsisko C, Worrell G A, He B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359838/,"The study developed a unified framework for precisely mapping the epileptogenic zone in the brain using different EEG biomarkers, such as interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations, and seizures.

41232063,Altered Interictal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis Connectivity in Patients With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder, with 30%-50% of patients developing drug-resistant epilepsy. Pharmacoresistant seizures remodel critical arousal and respiratory networks, impairing autonomic function and chemoreception and putting patients at increased risk of adverse respiratory events and sudden unexpected death (SUDEP). Given that the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) serves as a key relay between brainstem respiratory nuclei and cortical arousal networks, we characterized interictal BNST connectivity alterations in patients with TLE.We conducted a case-control study of patients with drug-resistant TLE evaluated for epilepsy surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared with healthy controls with no history of neurologic disease. Inclusion criteria for patients included clinical TLE diagnosis and age 18-65 years. Using resting-state fMRI (multiband factor = 3, repetition time [TR] = 1.3 seconds), we measured functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity through Granger causality (GC) between BNST and whole-brain cortical networks, and brainstem nuclei. Graph theoretical network metrics assessed BNST hub properties. Statistical analyses used multiple comparison corrections and age-corrected z-scores.Thirty-seven patients with TLE (mean age 42.5 ± 12.1 years, 43.2% female) and 33 healthy controls (mean age 36.2 ± 12.0 years, 54.5% female) were studied. Patients demonstrated bilateral reductions in BNST connectivity and causal influence with the whole brain (FC: -2.31 ± 2.87, p = 0.0032; GC: -0.18 ± 0.08, p = 0.0025). While FC showed preserved BNST-brainstem connectivity, GC revealed ipsilateral disruptions in BNST influence over ventral tegmental area (0.023 ± 0.026, p = 0.0067), median raphe (-0.009 ± 0.029, p = 0.0038), and cuneiform nuclei (0.012 ± 0.062, p = 0.0153). Critical respiratory circuits showed divergent reorganization: dorsal raphe-parabrachial complex pathways exhibited 57.2% efferent reduction (p = 0.0028), with 204.6% compensatory afferent increase (p = 0.0020), while dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus circuits showed bilateral deterioration (66.2% reduction in dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus [DR→LC], p = 0.0015; 56.4% reduction in LC→DR, p = 0.0189). Graph analyses confirmed compromised BNST network integration bilaterally (p < 0.05).Our findings reveal network reorganization in TLE that compromises autonomic and arousal circuit integrity, leading to failed respiratory-autonomic integration that may underlie respiratory vulnerability and increased SUDEP risk; however, we did not directly study SUDEP cases.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Reda A|Doss D J|Makhoul G S|Monroy Lerma B H|Johnson G|Sainburg L E|Cavender A C|Sundrani S|Liao E|Roche A|Long I|Kang H|Dawant B|Chang C|Bick S K|Nobis W P|Morgan V|Englot D J,Johnson G,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurological Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Nashville, TN.|Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; and.|Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.","Reda A, Doss D J, Makhoul G S, Monroy Lerma B H, Johnson G, Sainburg L E, Cavender A C, Sundrani S, Liao E, Roche A, Long I, Kang H, Dawant B, Chang C, Bick S K, Englot D J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41232063/,"The study found that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have reduced connectivity and influence of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) with the brain and brainstem regions involved in arousal and respiratory control.

41223342,Urine Sorbitol and Xylitol for the Diagnosis of Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency-Related Neuropathy.,"Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, due to biallelic loss-of-function variants in the SORD gene, is a recently recognized cause of autosomal recessive hereditary neuropathy. Specific diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone, and molecular genetic testing of SORD is complicated by the presence of a pseudogene. Biochemical testing of serum sorbitol is suggested as a potential biomarker. We report a novel urine biochemical profile of elevated excretion of sorbitol and a second polyol, xylitol, to aid in the identification of individuals with SORD-related neuropathy.Patients with confirmed or suspected SORD-related neuropathy were recruited by clinicians from 7 academic medical centers and 1 nonprofit specialty care center. Urine was analyzed by a clinically validated, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to measure sorbitol and xylitol excretion. Over 700 reference samples were evaluated from residual clinical samples. Clinical and molecular findings were gathered using a standardized questionnaire.Nineteen individuals with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of SORD-related neuropathy (median age 31 years, 47% female) and 715 reference samples were used to determine the initial performance of this index urine test. The median sorbitol excretion in affected individuals was 638 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 456; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 198). The median xylitol excretion was 1,577 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 1,242; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 102). In this patient cohort, the combination of sorbitol and xylitol yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity for SORD-related neuropathy. Four additional individuals who had clinical phenotypes compatible with SORD-related neuropathy had abnormal urine sorbitol/xylitol profile, 2 with genotypes involving a variant of unknown significance in SORD and 2 with a single heterozygous pathogenic SORD variant detected, whereas normal urine sorbitol/xylitol levels were observed in 11 asymptomatic, heterozygous carriers.These data demonstrate the clinical utility of urine sorbitol and xylitol analysis in the screening and diagnosis of SORD deficiency-related neuropathy. In addition, this is the first description of elevated xylitol in SORD deficiency as a clinically informative biomarker, which may increase the specificity of biochemical testing.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Bontrager J E|White A L|Brigatti K W|Laxen W|Loken P R|Grider T|Oglesbee D|Gavrilov D K|Tortorelli S|Hall P L|Matern D|Lauer E|Pickart A|Salsbery K|Niu Z|Smith C|Albright A|Mukherjee-Clavin B|Parmar P|Mhoon J|Massie R|Pilon-Cadieux C|Gauthier A|Alawneh J|Emilie Nguyen C|Shy M E|Koehler A E|Carson V J|Herrmann D N|Schultz M J,Bontrager J E|White A L|Laxen W|Loken P R|Oglesbee D|Gavrilov D K|Tortorelli S|Hall P L|Matern D|Lauer E|Pickart A|Salsbery K|Niu Z|Herrmann D N|Schultz M J,"Department of Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Clinic for Special Children, Gordonville, PA.|Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.|Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.|Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.|Department of Neurology, Montreal Neurological Hospital, McGill University, QC, Canada.|Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada; and.|Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE.","Bontrager J E, White A L, Brigatti K W, Laxen W, Loken P R, Grider T, Oglesbee D, Gavrilov D K, Tortorelli S, Hall P L, Matern D, Lauer E, Pickart A, Salsbery K, Niu Z, Schultz M J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41223342/,"The key finding of this medical research is that measuring the levels of sorbitol and xylitol in a person's urine can help diagnose a rare genetic condition called sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, which can cause nerve damage.

41142377,Infection-sensing minigenome as a novel therapeutic approach against Ebola virus.,"We describe here a molecular therapy that uses the virus's own proteins to combat itself. In this approach, infection-sensing RNAs encoding therapeutic genes are flanked by viral promoters and packaging signals in negative-sense orientation. These therapeutic minigenome RNAs do not express the transgene and remain silent in the absence of a viral infection. In contrast, if the cell is infected, the virus acts as a helper virus, providing viral proteins in trans to transcribe, replicate, and package the therapeutic minigenomes. Proof of concept for this therapeutic approach is demonstrated here using Ebola virus (EBOV) minigenomes expressing two antiviral transgenes: a short-hairpin (sh) RNA targeting the EBOV viral protein VP24 and an open-reading frame expressing a host peptide from the retinoblastoma-binding protein 6 (RBBP6). By using an EBOV tetracistronic-minigenome as a virus life cycle modeling system, we show here that both therapeutic minigenomes suppressed viral RNA replication and viral protein production, and a more than 50% reduction in the reporter signal was observed when cells were challenged with EBOV transcription/replication-competent virus-like particles. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of infection-sensing minigenome to combat EBOV and perhaps other viral pathogens.© 2025 The Author(s).",Molecular therapy.

40902075,Identification of 4 autophagy-related genetic variants as risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"We investigated the influence of 55 583 autophagy-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk across 4 independent populations comprising 5472 CLL cases and 726 465 controls. We also examined their impact on overall survival (OS), time to first treatment (TTFT), autophagy flux, and immune responses. A meta-analysis of the 4 populations identified, to our knowledge, for the first time, significant associations between CDKN2A (rs3731204) and BCL2 (rs4940571, rs12457371, and rs1026825) SNPs and CLL risk, with CDKN2A showing the strongest association (P = 1.57 × 10-12). We also validated previously reported associations for FAS, BCL2, and BAK1 SNPs with CLL risk (P = 4.73 × 10-21 to 3.39 × 10-9). The CDKN2Ars3731204 and FASrs1926194 SNPs associated with increased CDKN2A and ACTA2 messenger RNA expression levels in the whole blood and/or lymphocytes (P = 5.1 × 10-7, P = 1.58 × 10-21, and P = 7.8 × 10-41), although no significant effect on autophagy flux was observed. However, associations were found between CDKN2A, BCL2, and FAS SNPs and various T-cell subsets, cytokine production, and circulating concentrations of interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, CD40, chemokine ligand 20, and interleukin-2 receptor subunit β proteins (P ≤ .005). No significant association was detected between autophagy variants and OS or TTFT, suggesting that these variants drive disease initiation rather than progression. In conclusion, this study identified 4 novel associations for CLL and provided insights into the biological pathways that influence CLL development.Licensed under Creative Commons

40875887,Safety and efficacy of BCMA-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for the treatment of plasma cell leukemia.,"Despite significant therapeutic advances in multiple myeloma (MM), outcomes in patients with plasma cell leukemia (PCL) remain dismal. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with PCL who were treated with the B-cell maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) products idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel). We identified 34 patients; 19 patients received ide-cel and 15 received cilta-cel. With a median follow-up of 11.9 months, the overall median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4-15) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 13.0 months (95% CI, 8 to not estimable [NE]). The 1-year cumulative incidence of progression or death was 72%, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of death was 47%. Patients who received cilta-cel had a longer mPFS (19.0 months vs 6.0 months) and mOS (>23 months [NE] vs 9.0 months) when compared with those treated with ide-cel. Similarly, the 1-year cumulative incidence of disease progression or death was 37.5% (95% CI, 17.4-68.5) with cilta-cel, whereas all patients treated with ide-cel progressed or died within 12 months of infusion. The rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were similar between patients treated with cilta-cel and those treated with ide-cel and were consistent with those reported in patients with MM. In this first multicenter study that evaluated patients with PCL who were treated with standard-of-care CAR-T products, we show that CAR-T is safe, feasible, and associated with improved outcomes when compared with historic standards.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

40875593,"Cardiovascular degeneration in Erdheim-Chester disease: prevalence, burden, and outcomes.","Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare systemic histiocytic neoplasm, with cardiac morbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and cardiac conditions, playing a significant yet poorly understood role in the disease burden. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and prognosis of ECD in patients with (ECD-C) and without cardiac involvement (ECD-noC) and compared the burden of cardiac morbidities with matched controls. Patients diagnosed with ECD between 1990 and 2021 at a tertiary center were included, with cardiac involvement centrally assessed using radiographic studies. Cardiac morbidities were compared with a control group without ECD, matched for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking history. Among 104 patients with ECD, 39 (37%) had cardiac involvement. Patients with ECD-C had higher rates of hypertension (67% vs 46%), hyperlipidemia (67% vs 40%), heart failure (36% vs 8%), and pericardial effusion (28% vs 2%) than those with ECD-noC. Compared with the matched non-ECD cohort, patients with ECD had higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (20% vs 7%), heart failure (18% vs 4%), and antihypertensive drug use (55% vs 40%). Notably, patients with ECD-C had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) from frontline therapy compared with patients with ECD-noC (5-year PFS, 28.3% vs 70.5%). These findings highlight the burden of CV risk factors and cardiac conditions in ECD, even without a clinical diagnosis of ECD-C. Importantly, this cardiac morbidity burden is substantial for patients with ECD-C compared with ECD-noC. Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive cardiac risk assessment and management strategies to improve patient outcomes.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41237355,Natural History of Children and Adolescents With Dravet Syndrome: A 24-Month Follow-Up.,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is an intractable developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused primarily by pathogenic variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene. Patients with DS experience refractory seizures and significant cognitive and behavioral deficits. Longitudinal studies using standardized assessments are needed to systematically document patient outcomes over time. The BUTTERFLY study aimed to assess changes in adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over 24 months in patients with DS.BUTTERFLY was a US-based multicenter, longitudinal observational study involving patients with genetically confirmed DS who were receiving standard-of-care treatment. Patients aged 2-18 years with a confirmed DS diagnosis were included. Exclusion criteria included gain-of-function SCN1A variants, current sodium channel blocker treatment, or other disorders per investigator discretion. The primary outcome measures-adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment-were assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Third Edition (Vineland-3); Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III); and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months across 15 sites. Mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze disease progression, and comparisons were made with published standardized scores for population norms.Of the 36 patients enrolled, 21 completed the study. At baseline, the mean (SD) patient age was 10.8 (5.2) years, and 61.1% were female. Disease progression modeling indicated no significant improvements in 4 of the 6 Vineland-3 subdomains analyzed over 24 months. Receptive Communication (+7.24; 95% CI 1.30-13.19; p = 0.02) and Coping Skills (+4.61; 95% CI 1.14-8.08; p = 0.01) subdomains showed significant improvements. However, for Receptive Communication, this improvement translated to a magnitude of only approximately 3 months in developmental progression over the 24-month period. BSID-III and WPPSI-IV subtests did not show any significant improvement.Despite a relatively small sample size and high withdrawal rate, BUTTERFLY data reveal a widening developmental gap between patients with DS and children with typical development over 24 months. These findings reinforce the critical need for disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying genetic cause of DS to improve long-term outcomes.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Sullivan J|Wirrell E C|Knupp K G|Ciliberto M|Ziobro J|Chen D Y|Flamini J R|Zafar M|LaVallee N|Stepanians M|Ventola P|Chavan T S|Wang F|Parkerson K A|Ticho B,Wirrell E C,"University of California, San Francisco.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.|University of Iowa, Iowa City.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|University of California, San Diego.|Current affiliation: Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|PANDA Neurology, Atlanta, GA.|Duke University, Durham, NC.|PROMETRIKA LLC, Cambridge, MA.|Cogstate Ltd., New Haven, CT.|Porterhouse Medical US, Holmdel, NJ; and.","Sullivan J, Wirrell E C, Knupp K G, Ciliberto M, Ziobro J, Chen D Y, Flamini J R, Zafar M, LaVallee N, Stepanians M, Ventola P, Chavan T S, Wang F, Parkerson K A, Ticho B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237355/,"The study found that children with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy, showed little to no improvement in their adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over a 24-month period, despite receiving standard treatment.

41359349,Postmarket Drug Safety-Related Actions Before and After the US Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act.,"The 2007 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act (FDAAA) expanded its safety-related regulatory authorities, including enhanced postmarketing safety surveillance and new clinical study requirements. However, whether FDAAA has been associated with differences in the frequency and timing of postmarket safety-related actions remains poorly understood.To assess whether FDAAA was associated with differences in time to first FDA postmarket drug safety-related action, and to assess whether therapeutic and regulatory characteristics were associated with differences in time to these actions post-FDAAA implementation.This was a cross-sectional study of all novel therapeutics approved by FDA between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2019, and followed up through December 31, 2024. Approvals were categorized as pre- or post-FDAAA (before or after March 25, 2008). Post-FDAAA therapeutic and regulatory characteristics included drug class, therapeutic area, orphan status, special regulatory pathway, and presence of a boxed warning or FDAAA-mandated postmarket study requirement at approval.Time to first FDA postmarket drug safety-related action, a composite of withdrawals due to safety concerns, incremental boxed warnings, and safety-related communications.Of the 560 novel therapeutics approved, FDA took postmarket safety-related actions for 130 (23.2%) during a median (IQR) follow-up of 12.1 (7.8-18.2) years. These comprised actions within 5 years of approval for 34 of 164 therapeutics (20.7%) approved pre-FDAAA, and 57 of 396 (14.4%) approved post-FDAAA (rate ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-1.02; P = .06). Compared to pre-FDAAA approvals, after accounting for therapeutic and regulatory characteristics, there was no statistically significant difference in time to first postmarket safety-related action for post-FDAAA approvals (time ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-1.07; P = .07). However, among therapeutics with postmarket safety-related actions within 5 years of approval, median time to first action was shorter post-FDAAA (median [IQR], 3.1 (2.0-4.2) years for pre-FDAAA vs 1.8 [1.3-2.5] years post-FDAAA; P = .004). Among 260 novel therapeutics approved post-FDAAA, after the October 2013 enactment of breakthrough therapy designation, the following therapeutic and regulatory characteristics were associated with time to first postmarket safety-related action: small molecule type (time ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.81; P = .02), orphan designation (time ratio, 8.29; 95% CI, 2.43-28.27; P < .001), fast track (time ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.64; P = .005), breakthrough therapy designation (time ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.32; P < .001), prolonged regulatory review time (>400 days; time ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.73; P = .02), and FDAAA-mandated postmarket study requirements at approval (time ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.80; P = .01).This cross-sectional analysis found that the enhanced safety-related regulatory authorities of FDAAA were not associated with differences in time to first postmarket safety-related action.

41355666,"Diagnostic Performance and Interpreter Experience of 1-Hour Versus 3-Hour 99mTc-HMDP Cardiac Amyloid Radionuclide Imaging: A Prospective, Blinded Comparison.","Guidelines recommend 3-hour cardiac amyloid radionuclide imaging (CARI) for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Citing rapid blood clearance of 99mTc-hydroxymethylene-diphosphonate and efficient laboratory throughput, 1-hour imaging is increasingly practised despite limited supporting evidence. We sought to compare diagnostic performance and interpreter experience of 1-hour versus 3-hour 99mTc-hydroxymethylene-diphosphonate cardiac amyloid radionuclide imaging.Consecutive patients with suspected transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (n=114) underwent both 1-hour and 3-hour 99mTc-hydroxymethylene-diphosphonate single photon emission computed tomography (CT)/CT. Two cardiologist-radiologist reader teams, blinded to imaging timepoint (1 versus 3 hours), assessed overall interpretation, single photon emission CT-based Perugini grade, interpretation difficulty, interpreter confidence, and need for CT-fused images for anatomic localization. Discordant, equivocal, and difficult cases were arbitrated by a third tie-breaking team. The myocardial-to-blood-pool radiotracer uptake ratio (3-dimensional Score) was measured as a surrogate of contrast resolution.Interinterpreter agreement was high at both time points (κ≥0.81), with more cases requiring arbitration at 3 hours versus 1 hour (22% versus 13%; P=0.049). Overall interpretation and Perugini grades were concordant between time points in 111/114 (97%) and 106/114 (93%) patients, respectively. Three patients (3%) were negative at 1 hour but equivocal at 3 hours, all of which were clinically ruled out for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Interpreter confidence was comparable at both timepoints (97% versus 95%; P=0.317). Compared with 3-hour imaging, contrast resolution was inferior (lower 3-dimensional score, P<0.001) and CT fusion was more frequently needed (57% versus 31%, P<0.001) at 1-hour imaging.In a prospective, blinded comparison of 1-hour versus 3-hour 99mTc-hydroxymethylene-diphosphonate cardiac amyloid radionuclide imaging, diagnostic performance and interpreter experience were similar, with readers requesting CT fusion more frequently at 1 hour to optimize myocardial-to-blood pool discrimination.",Circulation.

41358614,Imprinted Binary Colloidal Crystals Support Growth and Stemness of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.,"Stemness of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be maintained in vitro using biophysical factors including surface topography. More specifically, multidirectional symmetries have shown promise in limiting cell-substrate interactions, yielding better stemness maintenance. Here, a parylene-C coating was deposited onto binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) to generate imprinted substrates with concave bowl-like micro/nanotopographies possessing multidirectional symmetry. Remarkably, the parylene coating is shown to have the fidelity to imprint sub-2 μm structures. The mESC response to these topographies observed in culture demonstrates the complementary influence of microtopography and nanotopography. While the nanoroughness associated with the small particle imprints appears to govern the attachment of cells, the microroughness associated with large particle imprints is able to limit the interaction of cells with the substrate thereby confining spreading. Our results demonstrate that imprinted BCCs with the combination of 5 μm (large) and 110 nm (small) particle imprints are able to provide spatially limited attachment of cells, resulting in improved colony shape, enhanced growth rate and upregulation of the expression of stemness markers of mESCs in culture in the presence of LIF.

Secondary outcomes included overall complication rates and time to return of bowel function.Of 218 patients, 139 (63.8%) underwent open surgery, 48 (22.0%) underwent laparoscopic surgery, and 31 (14.2%) underwent robotic surgery. Robotic surgery had the lowest estimated blood loss (median, 77.5 ml vs. 100 ml laparoscopic and 150 ml open, p < 0.0001). Conversion to open occurred in 16.1% of robotic cases versus 35.4% of laparoscopic cases (p = 0.0618). Minimally invasive approaches were associated with shorter hospital length of stay (median 3.0 days vs. 4.0 days, p < 0.0001) and faster return of bowel function (median 2.0 days vs 3.0 days, p = 0.0095) compared to open surgery. Overall 30-day morbidity was 23.4%, with no significant difference among approaches (p = 0.30). The temporal trend showed increasing adoption of robotic techniques, from 0% in 2018 to 53.8% in 2023, and a decrease in the proportion of cases approached by open surgery from 76.9% in 2018 to 23.1% in 2023.Retrospective design and single-institution experience with limited follow-up duration.Minimally invasive approaches to Hartmann's reversal are associated with improved short-term outcomes compared to open surgery.

41358945,Evaluating FDA-Approved GI Cancer Drugs: Clinical Benefit and Trial Endpoints Over the Past Two Decades.,"The increasing reliance on accelerated approvals and surrogate endpoints for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer therapies raises concerns about their clinical benefit and long-term patient outcomes. The shift toward single-arm trials in regulatory decisions further complicates treatment evaluation.This retrospective observational study evaluated all FDA approvals for GI cancer therapies from January 2006 through January 2025. Data were extracted from FDA archives, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubMed. Approvals were categorized by regulatory pathway (accelerated vs. regular), trial design (single-arm vs. randomized), and primary endpoint (surrogate vs. overall survival [OS]). Clinical benefit was assessed based on OS improvement and the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS). The primary outcome was the proportion of approvals based on surrogate versus OS endpoints. Secondary outcomes included use of single-arm designs, frequency of accelerated approvals, OS gain, and the proportion meeting ESMO-MCBS substantial benefit (score ≥4).The FDA granted 60 GI cancer drug approvals from 67 trials. Approvals rose from 15 (25%) in 2006-2014 to 45 (75%) in 2015-2025. Single-arm trials increased to 24%, and surrogate endpoints were used in 41.8% (ORR 20.9%, PFS 19.4%). Median OS improvement was 2.1 months (IQR: 1.6-2.65). Only 24.3% of trials met ESMO-MCBS substantial benefit. Of 15 accelerated approvals, 66.7% remained pending, 13.3% received full approval, and 20% were withdrawn.Expedited approvals have improved drug access in GI oncology, but modest benefits highlight the need to balance speed with outcomes that truly matter to patients.© The Author(s) 2025.

41359147,Antipsychotic use in bipolar disorder: clinical and genomic correlates- a Mayo clinic bipolar disorder biobank study.,"Responsiveness to mood-stabilizing pharmacotherapy varies in bipolar disorder (BD). We investigated clinical correlates of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) treatment response and conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS), including exploratory polygenic scores (PGS), of SGA pharmacogenomic treatment response in BD.Treatment response was quantified using the Alda scale, and GWAS was performed using Alda-A score, controlling for sex, genotyping batch, and the genomic principal components.The cohort included 2,159 adults with BD (1,416 BD-I, 691 BD-II, 51 schizoaffective BD), mean age 41.8 years, 62% female, 84% white, and 14% Hispanic. Nearly half (48%) were treated with SGAs. Current SGA users were younger (41.2 ± 14.7 vs. 42.5 ± 15.3 years, p = 0.040), more likely to be Hispanic (14% vs. 11%, p = 0.047), had a higher body mass index (BMI; 30.4 ± 7.6 vs. 29.5 ± 7.1 kg/m2, p = 0.005). Lifetime comorbidity patterns for current SGA users include higher rates of manic psychosis (29% vs. 17%, p < 0.001) and eating disorders - Anorexia Nervosa (7% vs. 4%, p = 0.003), Bulimia Nervosa (7% vs. 4%, p = 0.003), and Binge Eating Disorder (14% vs. 11%, p = 0.030). We detected a genome-wide significant association between SGA Alda-A scores and GAS7 variants (top variant: rs202127418, β=-2.998, p = 4.96E-08). However, SGA response was not significantly associated with PGS for schizophrenia, BD, and major depression (FDR > 0.05).SGAs are frequently utilized as mood stabilizers in patients with BD and are associated with manic psychosis and eating disorders.

41360010,sEEG-Based brain-computer interfacing in a large adult and pediatric cohort.,"Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort.Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband power during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery.26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone.Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Journal of neural engineering,"Dec 08, 2025",2025,Dec,08,Jensen M A|Schalk G|Ince N F|Hermes D|Worrell G A|Brunner P|Staff N P|Miller K J,Jensen M A|Schalk G|Ince N F|Hermes D|Worrell G A|Staff N P|Miller K J,"Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Jo-1-241, Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, UNITED STATES.|Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Jo-1-241, Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, UNITED STATES.|Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester, 200 First St. SW, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, UNITED STATES.|Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Jo-1-241, Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, UNITED STATES.|Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, UNITED STATES.|Department of Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine, 4921 Parkview Pl, St. Louis, 63110, UNITED STATES.|12Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic Rochester, 200 First St. SW, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, UNITED STATES.","Jensen M A, Schalk G, Ince N F, Hermes D, Worrell G A, Brunner P, Staff N P, Miller K J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41360010/,"The study found that a brain-computer interface (BCI) system using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) recordings can enable successful control of a cursor during overt hand, tongue, or foot movements in a large adult and pediatric patient cohort.

41359447,Management of Peyronie's disease: recommendations from the Fifth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2024).,"There is no ideal treatment for Peyronie's Disease (PD) since every patient has different needs with varying perceived risks versus benefits of individual treatment options, coupled with the degree of impact relating to PD on sexual function and beyond.The 5th International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM) guideline on PD provides an update to the previous ICSM with an aim to provide a clinical framework and best-evidenced consensus recommendations to assist clinicians in managing PD.Available literature was reviewed, and a modified Delphi consensus was undertaken by leading sexual medicine experts to achieve a set of Quality of Evidence and strength of recommendations. This guideline was developed as an authoritative best-evidenced consensus incorporating state-of-the-art knowledge and contemporary literature.A total of thirty-one recommendations were made on PD guidelines. New updates to the 4th ICSM on PD have been made in definition, pathophysiology, and treatment strategies. The presence of penile pain with erection could occur in the chronic phase due to torque or stretch on the penile scar and surrounding tissue. Oral therapy works best during the acute phase and should be provided concurrently with other treatment modalities. Penile traction therapy can reduce penile deformity as monotherapy or may be offered as part of a multimodal therapy approach. There is no convincing evidence supporting cellular-based therapy. The type of plication procedure used depends on the surgeon and patient preference, although excision of the tunica followed by plication may have a higher complication rate. There is currently no ideal graft, and graft contracture can occur postoperatively. Adjunctive procedures such as penile modeling, tunical plication, plaque incision/excision and grafting can be performed when penile deformity and/or penile curvature persist following penile prosthesis implantation.The management of PD should be individualized based on the patient's needs and preferences while balancing the benefits and risks of each treatment option.© The Author(s) 2025.

41359796,Immune thrombocytopenia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated immune thrombocytopenia (ICI-ITP) has been described in case reports and small case series, but comprehensive data on its incidence, risk factors, clinical features, treatment, and outcomes are lacking. We reviewed medical records of all adults initiating ICI therapy between 2016-2023 at 29 U.S. hospitals across seven major cancer centers to identify cases of ICI-ITP. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors, and Cox modeling was performed to assess the association between ICI-ITP, its severity, and mortality. Among 86,467 patients, ICI-ITP occurred in 214 (0.25%). Independent risk factors included lower baseline platelet count, combination ICI therapy, stage 4 cancer, and additional immune-related adverse events. ICI-ITP occurred at a median of 8 weeks (IQR, 4-18) after ICI initiation, with a median nadir platelet count of 41 x109/L (IQR, 17-64). Patients were treated with glucocorticoids (n=106, [49.5%]), immune globulin (n=39 [18.2%]), and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (n=29 [13.6%]). Recovery occurred in 161 patients (75.2%) at a median of 2.3 weeks (IQR, 1.0-5.3). Of 76 patients rechallenged with ICIs, 23 (30.3%) developed recurrent ICI-ITP. ICI-ITP and its severity were associated with higher all-cause mortality, with a nearly threefold increase in risk among patients with severe ICI-ITP compared with those without ICI-ITP (adjusted HR 2.96 [95% CI, 2.14-4.08]). These findings establish ICI-ITP as a rare but clinically significant complication of ICI therapy, provide the first large-scale description of its risk factors and clinical course, and underscore the importance of timely recognition and management.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Hematology.",Blood,"Dec 08, 2025",2025,Dec,08,Leaf R K|Mones J V|Shenoy T|Warsame M|Beltrami-Moreira M|Panch S|Leavitt A D|Zon R L|Kendall E K|Shahamatdar S|Lim T L|Cui C|Jiang D|Kaunfer S A|Durai L|Hoge S T|Dias J|Sha C|Holmes A|Easton N|Corley E|Zhao E|Li X|Spelman A|Amos C B|Soebbing D R|Shabih M|Jamison T|Liu B|Hussein G|Yadav S K|Elsaid M I|Owen D H|Mera A|Juras P K|Suresh A|Heskel M J|Huang J J|Glezerman I|Go R S|Reynolds K|Al-Samkari H|Kroll M H|Leaf D E,Warsame M|Liu B|Hussein G|Yadav S K|Go R S,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Mayo Clinic Health System, ROCHESTER, Minnesota, United States.|The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States.|University of Washington/Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Kirkland, Washington, United States.|UCSF, San Francisco, California, United States.|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.|Brigham and Women's Hospital, United States.|NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ney York, New York, United States.|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.|Mayo Clinic Health System, Mankato, Minnesota, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Mankato, Minnesota, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, United States.|Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.|University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States.|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.|Mayo Clinic, ROCHESTER, Minnesota, United States.|Massachusetts General Hospital.|Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.","Leaf R K, Mones J V, Shenoy T, Warsame M, Beltrami-Moreira M, Panch S, Leavitt A D, Zon R L, Kendall E K, Shahamatdar S, Lim T L, Cui C, Jiang D, Kaunfer S A, Durai L, Leaf D E, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359796/,"The key finding of this medical research is that immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated immune thrombocytopenia (ICI-ITP) is a rare but clinically significant complication of ICI therapy.

41360393,"NPY Y1 and Y2 receptors in the regulation of mouse recognition and procedural memory: Interplay with cellular signalling, noradrenergic transmission and monoamine concentrations.","Recognition and procedural memory are modulated by the noradrenergic system, whose terminals release noradrenaline along with neuropeptide Y, acting via Y1 and Y2 receptors. This study aims to investigate the role of Y1 and Y2 receptor antagonists (BMS-193885 and SF-11) on recognition and procedural memory, including their co-administration with clenbuterol, a β2-adrenoceptor agonist, with additional focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying memory-related behavioural changes.Recognition memory was assessed in mice using the novel object recognition task. Motor learning and procedural memory were evaluated in the accelerating rotarod test. Memory-related behavioural outcomes were complemented by analyses of NPY levels, the phosphorylation status of CaMKII and ERK1/2, along with the concentrations of 5-HT, dopamine, noradrenaline and its metabolite in selected brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.SF-11 at 5 mg·kg-1 impaired recognition memory, prolonged procedural memory retention and inhibited CaMKII, but at 20 mg·kg-1, SF-11 disrupted both recognition and procedural memory increasing NPY. BMS-193885, at 5 mg·kg-1, prolonged procedural memory retention, but at 20 mg·kg-1, it impaired long-term recognition memory, prolonged procedural memory retention, increased NPY and decreased phospho-CaMKII. Clenbuterol enhanced procedural memory retention, but this pro-cognitive effect was diminished by co-administration with either Y receptor antagonist, which correlated with decreased noradrenaline levels.NPY receptor antagonists modulate memory processes in a dose- and memory-type-dependent manner, and these effects appear to be linked to hippocampal function.

41361654,Prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with idiopathic scoliosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with idiopathic scoliosis.A systematic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted, covering studies published from their inception up to February 2024. Peer-reviewed studies that used echocardiograms to screen for cardiac abnormalities were included. Nine thousand five hundred fifty-four cases met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final data synthesis. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results were divided into subgroups to reveal the prevalence of each cardiac abnormality for further consideration.7.5% had cardiac abnormalities. Valvular diseases are the most common cardiac abnormalities. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most prevalent, accounting for 24.4% of cases. This is followed by mitral regurgitation (MR) at 17%, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) at 8%, aortic regurgitation (AR) at 3.8%, and pulmonary insufficiency at 1.9%. In addition, other valvular diseases collectively make up 22% of the findings. Congenital heart diseases (CHD) were also included in the results, with atrial septal defect (ASD) being the most prominent at 1.5%, followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD) at 1.4%, and other CHD comprising 2.5%. Pulmonary hypertension accounts for a substantial portion of the results, representing 16.8%. A dilated aortic root and pericardial effusion were observed in 2.4% and 0.9% of cases, respectively.Cardiovascular abnormalities are prevalent in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. This highlights the need for thorough cardiovascular screening of these patients before surgical intervention.© 2025.

41347395,Effects of Sex and Obesity on Lipid Metabolism During Low Intensity Exercise and Post-Exercise Period.,"Whether there are sex- and obesity-differences in fat oxidation and free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization during low intensity exercise is unclear.We studied 21 (9 females) participants without and 24 (16 females) with obesity during 5 hours of treadmill walking (~2 mph). We measured energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) and FFA-palmitate kinetics and oxidation with isotopic palmitate infusions ([U- 13 C]palmitate, and [1- 14 C]palmitate or [9,10- 3 H]palmitate). Skeletal muscle samples were collected at 1.5 and 5 hours of exercise and 24 hours after exercise. We calculated fatty acid (FA) oxidation, palmitate rate of disappearance (Rd), and intramyocellular triglyceride (imTG)-derived palmitate fractions during exercise.At rest, EE was 1.24 ± 0.23 kcal/min, with FA oxidation contributing 49 ± 13% of total EE. During exercise, FA oxidation accounted for 73 ± 8% of EE, and was not different between males and females (p = 0.34). Plasma FFA-palmitate concentrations were greater in females than males (p = 0.003), mean palmitate Rd and plasma palmitate clearance were not different (p = 0.32 and 0.14, respectively). Plasma FFA-palmitate Rd was correlated with EE (r = 0.49, p = 0.001), with a proportionally greater Rd response in females (p < 0.001). Although absolute plasma FFA-palmitate oxidation rates were comparable between sexes, the percent contribution of FFA-palmitate oxidation to EE was greater in females (p = 0.001). During exercise, imTG-palmitate fraction amounts remained stable.Lipid oxidation during low-intensity exercise is similar in males and females, independent of obesity, although next-day values were greater in participants with normal weight. Energy expenditure correlates with plasma palmitate disappearance rates, but is proportionally greater in females. Contribution of plasma palmitate oxidation is greater in females than in males during low intensity exercise.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,"Dec 08, 2025",2025,Dec,08,Costa D N|Jensen M D,Costa D N|Jensen M D,"Mayo Clinic, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Rochester, MN.|University of Maryland Midtown Campus, Internal Medicine, Baltimore, MD.","Costa D N, Jensen M D",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41347395/,"The study found that lipid oxidation during low-intensity exercise is similar in males and females, regardless of obesity.

41359652,A multi-mineral intervention to improve disease-related and mechanistic biomarkers in ulcerative colitis patients: Results from a randomized trial.,"The long-term goal of our ongoing studies is to determine if, and to what extent, a multi-mineral product (Aquamin) could benefit individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC). As a step toward achieving that goal, we carried out a pilot 180-day biomarker trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03869905) in patients with UC in remission or with mild disease.A total of 28 subjects participated in the study. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive either Aquamin for 180 days or placebo for 90 days. At Day-90, placebo subjects crossed over to Aquamin for the final 90 days. At Day-0, -90 and -180, serum samples were analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), intestine-specific ALP (ALPI), and for biomarkers of bone turnover (osteocalcin, TRAP5b and bone-specific ALP [BALP]). Stool specimens were assessed for fecal calprotectin (fCAL) and colon biopsies were examined histologically by Geboes scoring at the same time points. Each subject underwent DEXA scanning (at Day-0 and Day-180 only). In addition, mass spectrometry-based proteomic assessment was performed using colon biopsies obtained at each time point.Subjects who received Aquamin for the complete 180-day period (a total of 12) demonstrated improvements in all biomarkers (CRP, fCAL, ALP, ALPI, and Geboes scoring); this was not observed in the placebo group (16 subjects). When cumulative pre-post differences were compared between the Aquamin and placebo groups, Aquamin treatment significantly decreased these differences (a 24% decrease as compared to a 38% increase with placebo, p = 0.0284). Subjects who received Aquamin for 90-days showed intermediary responses. Subjects receiving Aquamin for 180 days also demonstrated increases in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), resulting in a statistically significant increase (7.3%, p = 0.0324) in the hip strength index over the treatment period. This was accompanied by increases in osteocalcin and TRAP5b and a decrease in BALP. The proteomic screen demonstrated upregulation of multiple gut barrier proteins, cell surface transporter molecules and certain proteins with anti-inflammatory potential in response to Aquamin. Aquamin treatment also led to downregulation of several proteins associated with the pro-inflammatory state.The results presented here suggest that the use of a multi-mineral intervention improves disease-related biomarkers in patients with UC. These studies suggest the potential value of the mineral intervention as a low-cost, non-toxic adjuvant therapy for mild UC or for individuals with UC in remission.Copyright: © 2025 Aslam et al.
