41160791,What Are the Functions of Interoception and Allostasis and Their Contribution to Neurologic Symptoms?,"Interoception is the sensing and representation of signals from the internal organs and involves a bidirectional communication between the brain and the body. Interoception also supports allostasis, which is the process by which the brain anticipates the needs of the body and preemptively initiate responses to meet internal or external demands. The coordination between these 2 processes is orchestrated by a distributed allostatic-interoceptive brain network. Impaired interoceptive accuracy, allostatic overload, and central sensitization contribute to the manifestations of neurodegenerative disorders and chronic functional neurologic symptoms.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Casar J C|Idiaquez J|Benarroch E,Benarroch E,"Departamento de Neurologia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago de Chile; and.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.","Casar J C, Idiaquez J, Benarroch E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160791/,"The study found that interoception, the sensing of internal signals, and allostasis, the brain's process of anticipating and responding to the body's needs, work together in a network.

41160790,Effectiveness of Infliximab for Refractory Nonischemic Cerebral Enhancing Foreign-Body Granulomatous Lesions After Endovascular Therapy.,"Nonischemic cerebral enhancing (NICE) foreign-body granulomatous lesions are an immune-mediated complication of endovascular therapy (EVT). No single immunotherapy has demonstrated consistent effectiveness. We highlight the novel use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibition in treating refractory NICE lesions.This multicenter case series describes 3 patients with refractory NICE lesions (recurrent seizures, persistent MRI enhancement, and/or steroid dependence with failure of ≥1 maintenance immunotherapy) treated with infliximab. Their clinical course, evaluation, and outcomes are detailed.Patients were women (median age 57 years [range 56-58]), presenting with headache and seizures within 6 months of EVT for intracranial aneurysm (n = 2) or carotid stenosis (n = 1). MRI (n = 3) revealed unilateral nodular enhancement with vasogenic edema, and brain biopsy (n = 2) revealed foreign-body granulomatous inflammation. All patients developed refractory disease and steroid dependence despite ≥1 immunotherapy including mycophenolate (n = 3), rituximab (n = 1), and/or cyclophosphamide (n = 1). Infliximab treatment resulted in significant clinical and radiologic improvement in all 3 patients.TNF-α inhibition may be an effective targeted treatment strategy for NICE foreign-body granulomatous lesions, expanding treatment options for patients with refractory disease. Larger prospective studies are needed to establish treatment guidelines aimed at improving outcomes in individuals with refractory disease.This article provides Class IV evidence that infliximab may offer potential benefit in patients with NICE lesions after EVT.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Aboseif A|Taha F|Tagg N T|Smith A D|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|Perez Giraldo G S|McKeon A,Aboseif A|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|McKeon A,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.|Departments of Neurology & Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.|Multiple Sclerosis Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Geisel School of Medicine Dartmouth College, Dartmouth, NH.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.","Aboseif A, Taha F, Tagg N T, Smith A D, Flanagan E P, Brown R D, Pittock S J, Perez Giraldo G S, McKeon A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160790/,"This study found that the drug infliximab, which blocks a specific protein involved in inflammation, can effectively treat a rare and difficult-to-treat complication of endovascular therapy called nonischemic cerebral enhancing foreign-body granulomatous lesions.

41161689,Decentralized Biobanking to Empower Patient Engagement in Biospecimen Research: Operational Feasibility Case Study.,"Background: Biobanks often lack standard mechanisms to keep donors connected to their biospecimens, reflecting a broken feedback loop that compromises trust, engagement, and scientific progress. Decentralized biobanking empowers patients to track their donations throughout the research journey, supporting personalized feedback and research collaboration via a privacy-preserving blockchain network. This case study explores operational feasibility of implementing decentralized biobanking for a large breast cancer biobank at a US academic medical center. Methods: A mixed-methods case study of the groundwork, implementation, and stakeholder feedback for a real-world decentralized biobanking app pilot was conducted. Biobank members were recruited from February to April 2023. Operational feasibility was assessed via analysis of institutional stakeholder perspectives, pilot engagement, and de-bi app activity. Findings: Physicians and other biobank stakeholders surfaced challenges surrounding managing expectations, balancing empowerment with clinical and research workflows, and navigating power dynamics between patients, physicians, scientists, and leadership. A total of 1080 participants enrolled over 10 weeks, including nearly 10% of the biobank with about 4000 biospecimens. During the pilot, biobank enrollment increased 65% versus the prior year, and there were no biobank withdrawals during or within 1 year following the pilot (p < 0.001 for both). The app, which facilitated biospecimen tracking and research engagement, was downloaded by 405 users. A total of 140 users tested the blockchain component, with 89% successfully claiming a nonfungible token representing their unique, immutable connection and access to donated biospecimens. Feedback was solicited to inform potential process improvements and risk assessments related to public relations, systems infrastructure, and ethical governance, illuminating next steps. Conclusions: We established operational feasibility for the first step toward decentralized biobanking, informed by requirements to manage expectations, workflows, and power dynamics. Our technical solution demonstrated robust participant engagement and compatibility with established biobanks, suggesting potential to build trust and align incentives and identifying next steps for communications, sustainability, and governance.",Biopreservation and biobanking,"Oct 30, 2025",2025,Oct,30,Dewan A|Altiery De Jesus V|Budd E|Sanchez W L|Kahn J|Miller R C|Macis M|Gross M,Miller R C,"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|Johns Hopkins University Berman Institute of Bioethics, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, New York, USA.|de-bi, co., Greencastle, Pennsylvania, USA.|Mayo Clinic, Department of Radiation Oncology, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.|Johns Hopkins University Carey School of Business, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.","Dewan A, Altiery De Jesus V, Budd E, Sanchez W L, Kahn J, Miller R C, Macis M, Gross M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41161689/,"The key finding of this medical research is that decentralized biobanking, which allows patients to track their donated biospecimens and collaborate in research, is operationally feasible.

40586687,"Foam sclerotherapy for symptomatic cysts in ADPKD, ADPLD and solitary cysts.","This medical center migrated from alcohol to sotradecol foam sclerotherapy (SFS) because of perceived improved efficacy in managing symptomatic kidney and liver cysts. We report technical aspects, change in short- and long-term cyst volumes, patient-reported outcomes, safety and applications of the technique.In this retrospective observational study, cases from January 2017 to December 2021 had TKCV/TLCV (per Targeted Kidney or Liver or Cyst analysis) segmented using a deep-learning algorithm and cyst segmentation software (pre-, post-procedure and longitudinally). TKCV/TLCV % change were evaluated using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. For analyses involving changes in cyst volumes, the median % change in cyst volume per patient was assessed. Longitudinal changes in cyst volumes were assessed using linear mixed models. Changes in quality of life (QOL) [Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA), Polycystic Liver Disease Quality of life Questionnaire (PLD-Q) and 12-item short-form (SF12)] were also assessed.There were 102 SFS sessions (38 kidney, 58 liver, 6 combined liver/kidney cysts) performed on 77 unique individuals included for analysis. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] % reductions in TKCV were -92.0% (IQR -98.2%, -82.7%, P < .001) and for TLCV were -83.1% (IQR -93.5%, -52.9%, P < .001). Among patients with multiple kidney procedures (n = 7), median % reduction in TKCV was -94.3% (IQR -96.6%, -92.4%, P = .023). For patients with multiple liver procedures (n = 11), median % reduction in TLCV was -63.3% (IQR -85.2%, -28.3%, P = .004). Results were similar among the four patients undergoing multi-stage procedures (n = 1 kidney, n = 3 liver). When measured longitudinally, both liver and kidney cyst volumes declined to levels near 0 mL by 1 year follow-up and remained stable several years later. LASA physical domain and PLD-Q QOL scores improved post-SFS procedure.SFS led to substantial long-term reductions in TKCV/TLCV and improved QOL. SFS can augment cyst volume reduction in addition to tolvaptan (kidney cysts) and octreotide (liver cysts). In some individuals with large symptomatic cysts, multiple SFS procedures were safe and effective in reducing TLCV/TKCV and improving symptoms.© The Author(s) 2025.

40107864,Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential: a review of its cardiorenal implications and aging.,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a non-malignant state characterized by hematopoietic stem cells exhibiting clonality driven by acquired mutations during aging. Using next-generation sequencing, it has been reported that the prevalence of CHIP increases exponentially with age. Thus far, epigenetic mutations including DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 are the most common mutations identified in driving CHIP. CHIP is considered a pre-malignant state, however with reports of its associations with non-malignant disease states, the clinical impact of CHIP has been of great interest, in particular its effect on the renal and cardiac systems. CHIP has been associated with a higher rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and increased risk of acute kidney injury. CHIP and its driver mutations have also been shown to increase cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis through various inflammatory pathways. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of CHIP through aging, its impact on kidney disease and implications on cardiovascular health. We also compare CHIP to another pre-malignant clonal disorder, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).© The Author(s) 2025.

41161867,Atypical Imaging Manifestations of Lateral Dural Tears with Arachnoid Herniations: A Multi-Institutional Study.,"Lateral dural tears are a common cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Frequently, these leaks are associated with an arachnoid diverticulum that herniates through the dural defect. CSF egress into the epidural space occurs from the margins of the dural tear rather than from the lateral portion of the herniated arachnoid diverticulum. Nonetheless, arachnoid diverticula can have secondary effects that alter the physiology and imaging appearance of lateral leaks. Specifically, we have anecdotally observed three unique variations of lateral dural tears, including 1) lateral dural tears where the herniated arachnoid diverticulum is associated with a CSF leak that involves the facet joint, 2) lateral tears where the arachnoid diverticulum is associated with a CSF-venous fistula and 3) lateral tears where there is contrast leaking into the epidural space on decubitus myelography without evidence of epidural CSF collections on pre-procedural spine MRI. In this clinical report, we describe a multiinstitutional retrospective case series of patients harboring these unique variations of lateral dural tears. We sought to elucidate the clinical and imaging features of these patients.ABBREVIATIONS: CB-CTM = cone beam CT myelography; CVF = CSF-venous fistula; PCD CTM = photon counting detector CTM; SIH = spontaneous intracranial hypotension.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41161832,Distal Radius Interventions for Fracture Treatment (DRIFT) trial: study protocol for a multicentre randomised clinical trial of completely translated distal radius fractures at paediatric hospitals in North America.,"Distal radius fractures are the most common fractures seen in the emergency department in children in the USA. However, no established or standardised guidelines exist for the optimal management of completely displaced fractures in younger children. The proposed multicentre randomised trial will compare functional outcomes between children treated with fracture reduction under sedation versus children treated with simple immobilisation.Participants aged 4-10 years presenting to the emergency department with 100% dorsally translated metaphyseal fractures of the radius less than 5 cm from the distal radial physis will be recruited for the study. Those patients with open fractures, other ipsilateral arm fractures (excluding ulna), pathologic fractures, bone diseases, or neuromuscular or metabolic conditions will be excluded. Participants who agree to enrol in the trial will be randomly assigned via a minimal sufficient balance algorithm to either sedated reduction or in situ immobilisation. A sample size of 167 participants per arm will provide at least 90% power to detect a difference in the primary outcome of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Upper Extremity computer adaptive test scores of 4 points at 1 year from treatment. Primary analyses will employ a linear mixed model to estimate the treatment effect at 1 year. Secondary outcomes include additional measures of perceived pain, complications, radiographic angulation, satisfaction and additional procedures (revisions, refractures, reductions and reoperations).Ethical approval was obtained from the following local Institutional Review Boards: Advarra, serving as the single Institutional Review Board, approved the study (Pro00062090) in April 2022. The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON, Canada) did not rely on Advarra and received separate approval from their local Research Ethics Board (REB; REB number: 1000079992) on 19 July 2023.

41157996,Deep Brain Stimulation in Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Although high-frequency brain stimulation has demonstrated efficacy in various translational models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is a scarcity of studies investigating deep brain stimulation (DBS) in human PTSD populations. The authors sought to investigate the current state of DBS in the setting of treatment-resistant PTSD.A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases by using keywords related to DBS and PTSD. A secondary search for gray literature was conducted in ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.Five articles reporting the effect of DBS on six patients with PTSD were retrieved. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally either in the basolateral amygdala (BLa; N=2) or in contact with the subgenual cingulum and uncinate fasciculus (SGC-UF; N=4). No significant perioperative complications related to BLa or SGC-UF lead implantation were reported in all five studies. BLa patients reported mild neuropsychiatric effects during stimulation. All but one patient had a significant decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score, with most reporting a subjective reduction in PTSD symptoms.Although additional research is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of BLa and SGC-UF DBS, these preliminary findings are encouraging. However, the application of DBS in psychiatric treatment remains controversial and largely experimental.
