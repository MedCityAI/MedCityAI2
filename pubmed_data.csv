41392146,Clevidipine versus nitroglycerin for blood pressure control during carotid endarterectomy: a cohort study.,"Clevidipine is an ultrafast-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist with selective arteriolar-dilating effects that may be suitable for afterload reduction during surgeries requiring tight blood pressure control. The objective of this single-center retrospective observational study was to evaluate the role of clevidipine to control blood pressure during carotid endarterectomy.Patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy from October 2024 to March 2025 who received clevidipine or nitroglycerin for intraoperative blood pressure management were included. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve of systolic blood pressure excursions outside the predefined target range of 140-160 mmHg. Secondary outcomes included corresponding measurements for mean arterial pressure and heart rate, as well as the incidence of significant clinical complications.Of 40 included patients, 20 received clevidipine and 20 received nitroglycerin. Patients in the clevidipine group spent significantly less time outside the goal systolic blood pressure range than the nitroglycerin group (10 min vs. 37.5 min, p < 0.001). The median normalized area under the curve per five-minute intervals was 29.59 mmHg × min (interquartile range, 15.83 to 49.35) in the clevidipine group versus 60.30 mmHg × min (interquartile range 42.79 to 74.38) in the nitroglycerin group (p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or clinical complications between the groups.Clevidipine was associated with significantly fewer blood pressure excursions outside the target goal range compared to nitroglycerin during carotid endarterectomy.© 2025.

41240399,Factors influencing timeliness of reporting results from multiple sclerosis related clinical trials to ClinicalTrials.gov.,"Timely reporting of clinical trial results is both an ethical obligation and a legal requirement under Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA). The law mandates that results from applicable clinical trials be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov within 12 months of the study's primary completion date. We examined reporting compliance among multiple sclerosis (MS)-related randomized controlled trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.Using a previously validated algorithm, we identified highly likely applicable clinical trials (HLACTs) related to MS that were completed or terminated between January 2008 and June 2023. Trial characteristics were extracted, and reporting timeliness was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, logistic regression (12-month reporting), and Cox regression (5-year reporting).Among 298 eligible trials, 64 (21.5 %) reported results within 12 months, while 268 (89.9 %) reported within five years. The reporting half-life was 18 months. Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials were more likely than Phase 4 trials to report within 12 months (OR 5.61, 95 % CI 1.43-23.82; p = 0.015). In contrast, Phase 2 trials were less likely than Phase 4 trials to report within five years (HR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.36-0.89; p = 0.013). Other characteristics, including funding source, intervention type, and enrollment, were not significantly associated with reporting timeliness.Only a minority of MS trials complied with the mandated 12-month reporting deadline, although nearly 90 % reported within five years. Phase-specific differences in compliance highlight potential areas for improvement in trial transparency. These findings may inform future efforts to promote timely reporting, though further research is needed before direct policy implications can be drawn.Copyright © 2024.

41141950,Impact and efficacy of sound machine on sleep in hospitalized adults: A systematic review.,"Sleep in hospitalized adults is impaired due to several reasons. Non-pharmacological approaches should be attempted first before considering medications to treat insomnia. Environmental noise levels in the hospital are also a major culprit that might result in disturbed sleep. While limiting any disturbance or sound during sleeping hours is crucial, it might not be completely feasible in the acute care setting. Sound machines that deliver a masking noise such as white noise are reported to mask these environmental noises and promote sleep. We aim to analyze the efficacy and safety of sound machines on sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults.A systematic review of all published literature was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO CINAHL, Google scholar, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to August 13, 2024. All studies that reported sound machine-based interventions on sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults were included. Sleep efficiency and other sleep related outcomes as total sleep time, latency, awakenings, and total sleep score were noted. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 for RCTs was used to evaluate study quality. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024595293).A total of 1920 studies were screened, of which 74 were selected for full text review. Seven RCT studies (n = 496 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were included. Two studies were from USA, and India each, while one study was reported each from Iran, China, and South Korea. Six of the seven studies used white noise, while one study reported using Uncorrelated Signal and Ambient noise in Space Integration (USASI) masking noise. Two studies reported using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) each to measure sleep outcomes. White noise was well tolerated with no major adverse effects reported, and only 8 participants discontinued the study due to discomfort or found it less acceptable. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of improved sleep efficiency with white noise use in hospitalized adults. Given the heterogeneity in the duration of white noise use, inclusion criteria, and the outcome measurement scales in this small sample of RCT studies, meta-analysis was not feasible.White-noise and other similar masking noises seem to improve sleep efficiency in hospitalized adults, with good tolerability. Only limited studies report the efficacy and demonstrate wide heterogeneity in the duration of masking noise use, varied inclusion criteria, and outcome measurement scales. Larger studies analyzing the hospitalized patient population type, across different units, to identify the best patient population who would benefit from these masking sounds are needed.© 2025 The Authors.

41082955,Echocardiographic Predictors of Mortality in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is associated with high mortality in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) patients. We sought to determine the association of Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) parameters with in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the CICU, and found to have PH. We included Mayo Clinic CICU admissions from 2007 to 2018, with a TTE within 1 day of CICU admission demonstrating PH, defined as estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) ≥36 mmHg. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. We included 3085 unique CICU patients with PH by TTE; median age was 73.7 (63.8, 82.4) years, and 1343 (43.5%) were females. Heart failure (65.6%) and respiratory failure (34.0%) were the most common admission diagnoses. The median RVSP was 47 (41, 56) mmHg, and 1314 (42.6%) had RVSP ≥50 mmHg. A total of 337 (10.9%) patients died during hospitalization. The RVSP was higher among in-hospital deaths (51 vs 47 mmHg, p < 0.001), reflecting higher right atrial (RA) pressure (14 versus 10 mmHg, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality increased with higher RA pressure and worse Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery (RV-PA) coupling, such as a lower tricuspid S' velocity to RVSP ratio (AUC 0.72) or higher pulmonary artery elastance (AUC 0.72). In conclusion, in CICU patients found to have elevated pulmonary pressures, several 2D and Doppler TTE parameters predict in-hospital mortality. Specifically, RA pressure and parameters of RV-PA coupling, had highest association with worse outcomes. Early identification of high-risk hemodynamic parameters may facilitate improved investigation, management, and prognostication.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

41075346,The hidden toll: Atrophy of key central nervous system relays in African American women with multiple sclerosis.,"African American persons with MS (AApwMS) have more aggressive clinical and imaging outcomes than White American pwMS (WApwMS), including lower brain and spinal cord (SC) volumes. However, imaging studies are lacking considering the effects of sex, race, and ethnicity together.Compare MS clinical and imaging features among AApwMS and WApwMS, incorporating the modifying effects of sex, race, and ethnicity.Clinical variables and MRI were obtained for AApwMS and WApwMS.Thirty-five MRIs in 28 AApwMS (61 % female) and 255 MRIs in 91 WApwMS (68 % female) were evaluated. AApwMS had a shorter MS disease duration (median 5.9 years, IQR 2.7-13.1) compared to WApwMS (9.4 years, IQR 3.8-17.0; p = 0.034). Fewer AApwMS ever used disease modifying therapy (69 %) compared to WApwMS (92 %; p < 0.001), while the likelihood of having progressive MS and developing severe disability were similar between groups (p > 0.05). AA women with MS had smaller thalamus (p = 0.016), cerebellar grey matter (p = 0.025), and SC-C2 (p = 0.005) volumes than WA women with MS. Although multiple brain and SC regions were smaller in AA men than WA men with MS, the differences were not significant.Interaction between sex, race, and ethnicity may influence differences in imaging metrics of key central nervous system relays, likely preceding clinical worsening in MS.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

40591976,Diagnosis and Management of Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy.,"The treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), which encompasses cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, has progressed markedly over the past few decades. The natural history of DCM includes multiple phenotypes: a slow deterioration, a stepwise pattern of decline, and rapidly progressive functional decline. Symptoms include gait disturbance, decreased fine motor abilities, weakness, sensory changes, and neck pain. Classically, those with minimal or early symptoms were treated conservatively with observation; however, newer investigations suggest evidence for early surgical treatment. Those with objective myelopathic symptoms confirmed by imaging demonstrating spinal cord compression are indicated for surgery. Surgical treatment can be accomplished with multiple different technical approaches including anteriorly based surgery, posteriorly based surgery, and combined techniques. Traditionally, anterior surgery included anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF), but increasing investigations incorporate cervical disk arthroplasty in this cohort of patients. Historically, laminectomy for posterior decompression was a hallmark of treatment in DCM; however, this led to complications such as postlaminectomy kyphosis and instability which has led to substitution of this treatment by laminoplasty and laminectomy + fusion. Surgical adjuncts such as Riluzole have demonstrated promise in the treatment of DCM patients. Success in surgical treatment is defined by decompression of the spinal cord to halt progression of symptoms and in some patients improve function. Although surgical treatment has yielded success in the treatment of DCM, perioperative complications can be devastating which make surgical technique and patient selection paramount.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Dec 15, 2025",2025,Dec,15,Mechas C|Sarraj M|Helgeson M,Mechas C,"From the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Division of Spine Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Mechas C, Sarraj M, Helgeson M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591976/,"Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a condition that can cause problems with walking, hand function, and neck pain.

41392201,Type B aortic dissection in patients aged 30 years or younger: a retrospective multicentre study.,"Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) is rare in patients aged ≤30 years, and data on this population remain limited. This study aimed to characterize the underlying etiology, and outcomes of invasively treated young patients with TBAD, with a focus on the impact of heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD).A retrospective multicentre analysis was conducted across 19 international aortic centres, including 139 patients aged ≤30 years with TBAD. Patients with chronic TBAD (n = 42) were excluded for the final analysis. The cohort was classified as uncomplicated (n = 86) or complicated (n = 53) TBAD. Clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected using standardized forms. Outcomes were compared between subgroups defined by TBAD complexity, HTAD status, and surgical strategy. Kaplan-Meier and Andersen-Gill analyses were used for survival and recurrent aortic intervention, respectively.Mean follow-up time was 6.5 years. HTAD was identified in 57% of patients. Most presented with uncomplicated TBAD (62%), while high-risk uncomplicated cases were uncommon. Endovascular repair was predominant in complicated TBAD, while open repair was more frequent in uncomplicated cases. Early mortality was low (n = 3), and mid-term survival was excellent across all subgroups. HTAD was a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions (HR = 3.3, p = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in survival or reintervention rates between uncomplicated and complicated TBAD or between operative strategies.In young patients, TBAD predominantly occurs in the context of HTAD. Both open and endovascular repair are associated with excellent early outcomes and mid-term survival. However, HTAD remains a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions.© The Author(s) 2025.
