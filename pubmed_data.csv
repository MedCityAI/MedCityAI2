41177894,Dual abstinence from nicotine vaping and cannabis use among young people: secondary analyses from two U.S.-based randomized controlled trials of vaping cessation.,"To examine patterns of abstinence from nicotine vaping and cannabis use among adolescent and young adult (YA) e-cigarette users in two text message vaping cessation trials.Among adolescents with complete 7-month data (n = 1,016) at baseline, 25.4% were Exclusive E-cigarette Users (no past 30-day cannabis use) and 74.6% were Dual Users (past 30-day cannabis use). Among YAs with complete 7-month data (n = 1,829), 40.8% were Exclusive E-cigarette Users and 59.2% were Dual Users at baseline. Primary analyses examined the proportion of participants who were Dual Abstinent at 7-months by treatment arm differences. We also examined for interaction effects between baseline product use and vaping status at 7 months on cannabis use outcomes.At 7-months, adolescent categories of use were: Dual Abstinent, 31.7% (95% CI: 28.8, 34.6); Exclusive E-cigarette Users, 18.2% (95% CI: 15.9, 20.7); Exclusive Cannabis Users, 15.1% (95% CI: 12.9, 17.4); Dual Users, 35.0% (95% CI: 32.1, 38.1). Among YAs: Dual Abstinent, 15.6% (95% CI: 13.9, 17.3); Exclusive E-cigarette Users, 29.4% (95% CI: 27.3, 31.6); Exclusive Cannabis Users, 12.8% (95% CI: 11.3, 14.5); Dual Users, 42.2% (95% CI: 39.9, 44.5). Intervention outperformed Control in promoting rates of Dual Abstinence among adolescents (38.5% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.0001) and YAs (17.9% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.007). A higher proportion of Exclusive E-cigarette Users compared to Dual Users were Dual Abstinent at follow-up (adolescents: 37.6% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.019; YAs: 25.8% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.001).A text message nicotine vaping cessation intervention promoted dual abstinence from e-cigarettes and cannabis among adolescents and YAs. Dual abstinence rates were higher among exclusive vapers than dual users, signaling the need to optimize cessation programs for dual users.Studies included were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04251273, registered on January 31, 2020; NCT04919590, registered on June 9, 2021).© 2025.

40926810,"MAGIS syndrome: phenotypes, pathogenesis, and treatment.","Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) presenting with immunodeficiency and autoimmunity can illuminate pathways essential for immunocompetence and self-tolerance. We recently characterized a new IEI named MAGIS (""Midline malformations of the brain, Anterior pituitary gland dysfunction, Growth retardation, Immunodysregulation/immunodeficiency, and Skeletal defects"") caused by heterozygous germline activating mutations in GNAI2 (encoding the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gαi2). This disorder demonstrates the central role of Gαi2 regulation of chemotaxis in humans and a novel pathway by which G-proteins regulate T-cell activation.

41177945,Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.,Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a morphological hybrid between myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterized by clonal monocytosis. Myeloid neoplasm-associated somatic mutations are present in >90% of patients with CMML but are not diagnostically specific but a subset are prognostically relevant. Current drug therapy in CMML is mostly palliative and not disease-modifying. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment modality in CMML and its timing is determined by formal prognostic models including the recently developed BLAST and BLAST-molecular risk models.© 2025 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,British journal of haematology,"Nov 02, 2025",2025,Nov,02,Tefferi A|Patnaik M M,Tefferi A|Patnaik M M,"Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Tefferi A, Patnaik M M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41177945/,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a type of blood cancer that has features of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders.

41176728,Nonsurgical Integrative Treatments for Symptomatic Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis: A Multinational Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel nonsurgical integrative treatment, Mokhuri Chuna (MC), in patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS).This multinational randomized controlled trial was conducted at Mokhuri Oriental Medicine Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from June 2017, to December 2022. Patients with symptomatic DLS were randomized 1:1 by study site to receive MC or standard care (SC) twice weekly for 5 weeks, followed by a 96-week posttreatment evaluation period. The primary endpoint was change in back pain (VAS). Secondary endpoints included changes in leg pain (VAS), physical function (ODI), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D), walking capacity, and safety. Patients were evaluated at baseline (Week 1), weekly during Week 2 through 6, and at 7, 18, 30, 54, and 102 weeks. Data analysis was performed in April 2024.In the randomized cohort of 115 patients (mean ± SD age, 59.97±10.96 years; 56 females [48.7%]), 58 patients were assigned to MC and 57 to SC. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis of 112 patients (56 per group), the MC group showed significant improvements in back pain (-10.27; 95% CI, -19.22 to -1.32; P=.02) and leg pain (-11.91; 95% CI, -21.15 to -2.68; P=.01) compared with the SC group. No significant differences were observed in ODI, EQ-5D, or walking capacity. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either group.In patients with symptomatic DLS, MC was safe and more effective than SC for relieving back and leg pain, offering a promising nonsurgical treatment option.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03107468.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.
