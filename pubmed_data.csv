41390815,Human cerebrospinal fluid net flow enhanced by respiration during the awake state.,"Cerebrospinal fluid dynamics play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by delivering nutrients, transmitting immune signals, and clearing waste products. While cardiac activity primarily drives the pulsatile movement of cerebrospinal fluid, respiration has been shown to facilitate low-frequency oscillations and contribute to bulk flow. Recent studies suggest that enhancing respiratory function may be an effective intervention to modulate cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. This study included 20 individuals with long-term formal training in Seokmun Hoheup, a lower belly-centered breathing practice (mean ± SD age, 58.1 ± 17.3 years; 8 females), and 25 controls with no formal long-term breathing practice (mean ± SD age, 49.2 ± 20.2 years; 12 females). All underwent real-time velocity-encoding magnetic resonance imaging to assess cerebrospinal fluid movement at the foramen magnum and lateral ventricle during both regular breathing and deep breathing. Deep breathing enhances cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in both groups, increasing displacement and net flow, particularly at the foramen magnum. Seokmun Hoheup trained participants show greater cerebrospinal fluid movement than controls at both the foramen magnum and lateral ventricle. Even during regular breathing, trained participants show higher cerebrospinal fluid mean speed, displacement, and net flow. Among respiratory factors, inhale length and diaphragm displacement show the strongest correlations with cerebrospinal fluid movement. Respiration modulated cerebrospinal fluid dynamics through both mechanical enhancement of venous outflow and autonomic modulation of the heart, with mechanical effects predominating in the lateral ventricle and both pathways contributing to the foramen magnum. Our findings identify respiration in the awake state as a modifiable, noninvasive mechanism that influences involuntary functions such as cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and may have implications for cerebrospinal fluid-mediated brain homeostasis.© 2025.

41389132,"Enhancing Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Complex Congenital Heart Disease: The Role of Spirometry, Body Composition, and Handgrip Strength.","Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a cornerstone of functional assessment in congenital heart disease (CHD), yet there are additional important contributors to exercise limitation that are not directly measured by CPET. This narrative review highlights the complementary utility of spirometry, body composition analysis, and evaluation of handgrip strength in augmenting our understanding of functional capacity in CHD. Spirometry provides insights into restrictive lung disease patterns prevalent in post-surgical CHD populations; body composition analysis, especially lean mass assessment, can reveal sarcopenia not apparent using BMI alone; and handgrip strength serves as a validated surrogate for overall muscular function and frailty. We propose routine integration of all three testing techniques as complements to CPET protocols to enhance clinical assessment, guide rehabilitation, and support prognostication in pediatric CHD patients. This review advocates for broader adoption and standardization of these measures in clinical settings to improve risk stratification and long-term outcomes.© 2025.

41183370,Bridging the Physician Knowledge Gap in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Breast Imaging Care.,"Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face unique challenges in accessing affirming, evidence-based breast imaging care because of longstanding disparities in provider education, institutional practices, and imaging guidelines. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, such as chest masculinization or breast augmentation, impact breast tissue composition and cancer risk, necessitating individualized imaging approaches. Through multiple clinical vignettes, this article illustrates potential pitfalls and key considerations in breast imaging for TGD patients, including appropriate imaging recommendations, inclusive system-level changes, and navigating patient encounters. Education of breast imaging radiologists, technologists, and front-desk staff is critical to bridge the known knowledge gap and improve outcomes for this patient population. By adopting inclusive, culturally competent, and trauma-informed practices, breast imaging professionals can help reduce disparities and improve the experience and health outcomes of TGD patients.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.
