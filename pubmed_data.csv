41318725,Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guideline for the gene-drug interaction between TPMT/NUDT15 and thiopurines.,"The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) describes gene-drug interactions to facilitate pharmacogenetic implementation in clinical practice. The current guideline describes the gene-drug interactions for TPMT, NUDT15 and thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine). Evidence based recommendations were obtained via a literature review of published studies. This literature review showed that gene variants leading to a decreased activity of TPMT and/or NUDT15 result in higher risk of toxicities, especially bone-marrow depression. For intermediate metabolisers (IM) of TPMT or NUDT15, it is advised to start with 50% of the normal dose when treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. For poor metabolisers (PM), it is advised to start with an alternative treatment or to reduce the dose to 10% of the normal dose. For thioguanine, a dose of 75% of the normal dose is advised for TPMT IM and 50% of the normal dose for NUDT15 IM. Alternative treatment or a start dose reduction is advised for PM. A start dose of 6-7% can be used for TPMT PM and of 10% for NUDT15 PM. For TPMT or NUDT15 IM treated for leukaemia, starting with the normal dose can be considered and then decrease the dose to the advised dose described above in case toxicities occur. For NUDT15 PM reduced starting dose is advised only if an alternative is not possible, due to a higher uncertainty in the calculated dose reduction for NUDT15 PM than for TPMT PM.DPWG classifies genotyping for TPMT and NUDT15 ""essential"" before thiopurine initiation.© 2025.

41318666,Plasma assay of methylated DNA markers detects recurrent metastatic breast cancer.,"Up to 30% of women with no evidence of disease after curative intent breast cancer treatment will relapse and succumb to metastatic disease. Liquid biopsy of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to identify patients with relapse prior to imaging. Tumor-informed ctDNA panels are expensive and require patient tumor tissue for customization. We aimed to assess tumor-agnostic methylated DNA markers (MDMs) to detect recurrent metastatic breast cancer in comparison to cancer-free patients and those with no evidence of disease. We discovered and down-selected candidate MDMs from a series of tissue-based experiments on primary breast cancer tissue from a balance of molecular subtypes compared to matched non-cancer patient breast tissues. We then used Target Enrichment Long-probe Quantitative Amplified Signal assays to quantify 16 MDMs from cfDNA extracted from peripheral blood samples from 60 metastatic breast cancer patients (59 females, 1 male), 60 age-matched females with no prior cancer, and 60 age-matched females without evidence of metastatic disease at least 9 months after curative intent treatment of primary breast cancer. Among the 16 MDMs, ten had single-marker areas under the curve (AUCs) above 0.90, with the highest at 0.96, whereas in the same patients, three protein markers (CA153, CEA, CA125) performed with an AUC of 0.86, 0.84, and 0.75, respectively. The results indicate that a multi-marker methylation panel can detect metastatic breast cancer patients.© 2025.

41317225,Prevalence of Precursor Lesions in Gastric Adenocarcinoma Specimen: Insights into Pathogenesis in the United States Population.,"Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) remains a major public health concern in the U.S., characterized by late presentation and poor outcomes. While the Correa cascade describes a multistep progression from precursor lesions (PLs) to cancer, its applicability to U.S. GAC cases remains uncertain.To evaluate the prevalence of histologic PLs in patients diagnosed with GAC and assess opportunities for earlier detection.We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with GAC at a tertiary care center from 2003 to 2023. Histologic PLs including atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and dysplasia were identified in GAC resection specimens. Prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Helicobacter pylori data were also reviewed. Comparisons were made across clinical, histologic, and treatment characteristics by PL presence in GAC resection specimens.Among 118 patients (97.5% male, mean age 72.6), PLs were present in 35.6% of GAC resection specimens, most commonly GIM (78.6%). Of these, 26.2% had undergone prior EGD, and only 36.4% had previously documented PLs. Intestinal-type GAC was more common in patients with PLs (73.8 vs. 18.4%, p < 0.001), while diffuse-type predominated in those without. Time from H. pylori diagnosis to GAC was longer in patients with PLs (222 vs. 166 months, p = 0.03), but only 33.9% had H. pylori testing prior to diagnosis.Over one-third of GAC cases had PLs present at diagnosis, yet few had prior endoscopic detection, highlighting missed prevention opportunities.© 2025.

41317038,Risk Factors and Management of Incomplete Microscopic Colitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The term ""incomplete microscopic colitis"" (MCi) has been suggested to define patients with chronic watery diarrhea not fulfilling the complete histologic criteria for MC. There are inconsistent data on the epidemiology of MCi and the optimal management of these patients.A systematic search of randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational studies of adults with biopsy-proven MCi (incomplete lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis) was conducted using Cochrane, Medline, Scopus, and Embase from inception to May 6, 2025. Data were extracted on (1) incidence and prevalence of MCi, (2) patient features and risk factors, (3) clinical response with treatment, and (4) relapse after treatment cessation. Data were pooled using the random-effects model to calculate weighted pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Of 136 potentially relevant publications identified, 49 passed abstract screening, and 17 studies (1 RCT and 16 observational) were included, with a total of 1370 patients with MCi (median age of 62 years and 69.6% women). The incidence rate of MCi ranged from 0.96 to 5.0 cases per 100 000 person-years. The pooled proportion of concurrent autoimmune disease with MCi was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.28; I2 = 95%), and 46% (95% CI, 0.28-0.64; I2 = 95%) were on medications associated with microscopic colitis (MC). The pooled clinical remission rate with any induction therapy was 78% (95% CI, 0.68-0.89; I2 = 81%) and 85% (95% CI, 0.72-0.98; I2 = 88%) with budesonide.Patients with MCi share similar characteristics with full MC including demographics, risk factors, and response to therapy, indicating that the histologic criteria for MC should potentially be broadened.© The Author(s) 2025.

41167201,"Percutaneous transcatheter valve replacement in individuals with mitral regurgitation unsuitable for surgery or transcatheter edge-to-edge repair: a prospective, multicountry, single-arm trial.","Patients with severe mitral regurgitation are frequently not candidates for surgery or transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). We aimed to evaluate 1-year outcomes of a novel percutaneous transseptal transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system in patients unsuitable for surgery or TEER.In this prospective, multicentre, single-arm, pivotal trial, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe mitral regurgitation who were not suitable for surgery or TEER were recruited at 56 centres in six countries (the USA, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Israel, and Australia). Eligible patients were treated with TMVR using the SAPIEN M3 system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The primary endpoint was a non-hierarchical composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalisation at 1 year in the as-treated population, compared with a prespecified performance goal of 45%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04153292, and is ongoing.Between June 9, 2020, and Oct 10, 2023, 1171 patients were screened, of whom 299 were treated. Follow-up data were available for 283 (95%) patients at 30 days and 243 (81%) at 1 year (median follow-up 1·4 years [IQR 1·0-2·1]). The median age was 77·0 years (IQR 70·0-82·0), 152 (51%) participants self-reported as male and 147 (49%) as female, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of 30-day mortality for mitral valve replacement was 6·6%. There were no intraprocedural deaths, no instances of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction causing haemodynamic compromise, and no conversions to surgery. The primary endpoint rate of 25·2% (95% CI 20·6-30·6) was significantly lower than the prespecified performance goal of 45% (p<0·0001).Percutaneous transseptal TMVR with the SAPIEN M3 system effectively reduced mitral regurgitation with low rates of complications and mortality. These findings support percutaneous TMVR with the SAPIEN M3 system as a therapeutic option for patients who are unsuitable for surgery or TEER.Edwards Lifesciences.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.
