41258275,Outcomes of left atrial appendage occlusion with atrial fibrillation ablation: a real-world analysis from the National Inpatient Sample database.,"The safety and cost of concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedure remain unknown.The study sought to determine real-world outcomes of AF patients who underwent LAAO with ablation.The National Inpatient Sample and International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision codes were used to identify patients who underwent LAAO with and without AF ablation during the years 2016-2022. The outcomes assessed included procedural complications and resource utilization.LAAO with AF ablation was associated with a higher rate of overall (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.74), major complications (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.60), non-home discharge (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.96), prolonged length of stay > 1 day (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.92-3.52), and increased hospitalization costs as defined by median cost > $25,926 (OR 19.42, 95% CI 16.21-23.25) when compared to LAAO alone after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Patients who underwent LAAO with ablation were also more likely to receive pacemaker implantation (3.6% vs 0.2%, P < 0.001) and experience acute kidney injury (3.9% vs 2.1%, P < 0.001) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (3.7% vs 1.5%, P < 0.001).In a large, contemporary, real-world study of LAAO procedures in the USA, concomitant AF ablation was associated with a higher rate of overall and major complications and an increased resource utilization.© 2025.

41259653,A framework for using DNA methylation-based modelling for the clinical management of cranial meningioma.,"DNA methylation profiling can be used to robustly predict postsurgical outcomes and response to radiotherapy (RT) for meningioma patients. To allow for seamless integration of these complementary models into clinical practice, a practical framework is needed.We leveraged a cohort of nearly 2000 surgically-treated meningiomas with DNA methylation profiling and clinical outcomes data. Existing methylation-based prediction models were dichotomized to yield four risk groups: low and high recurrent risk, each with RT sensitive and resistant subgroups. Risk groups were correlated with progression-free survival in the context of existing biomarkers including extent of resection and WHO grade.We first demonstrated that all risk groups benefit from gross total resection. All ""high-risk, RT sensitive"" tumors (n = 306, 15.7%) also benefited from adjuvant RT: after GTR, median PFS increased from 4.68 (4.13-9.48) years to not reached (p = 0.003); after STR, from 2.12 (1.59-3.02) to 4.09 (3.41-not reached) years (p = 0.004). ""Low-risk, RT sensitive cases"" (n = 1207, 61.8%) also benefitted from RT after STR (median PFS 7.39 (6.66-12.8) vs. 16.53 (10.35-not reached) years, p = 0.03), suggesting that RT be considered in these patients. Neither ""low-risk RT resistant"" (n = 84, 4.3%) nor ""high-risk RT resistant"" (n = 356, 18.2%) cases benefitted from RT, and the latter group was associated with universally poor outcomes.We identify methylation-defined risk groups of meningioma for which additional benefit is gained from adjuvant RT, leading to a clinical decision-making framework for straightforward integration of molecular models into clinical practice.© The Author(s) 2025.

41254255,Diagnostic performance of X-ray-based deep learning models for detecting ankle and foot fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lower extremity fractures are prevalent in vulnerable populations leading to significant burdens, which highlight the need for timely and precise diagnosis. Integrating deep learning with imaging findings has shown promising results for enhancing fracture detection accuracy. This study assesses the diagnostic accuracy of AI models using X-ray images to detect ankle and foot fractures and investigates the probable factors influencing their performance.A comprehensive search of four databases was done up to September 30th, 2025. Studies that investigated the accuracy of deep learning models for the detection of ankle and foot fractures utilizing X-rays were included. A bivariate random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis.A total of 506 studies were reviewed, and 14 were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of all the representative models of the included studies had a cumulative sensitivity and specificity of 93.2% and 94.5% (95% CI 88.8-95.9%, 90.1-97.0%, respectively, I2 6.6%). The pooled F1 score was estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.97). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in the sensitivity or specificity of studies using multi-view vs. single-view X-rays (P = 0.64, P = 0.89, respectively). Models detecting calcaneal fractures performed significantly better than models detecting foot or ankle fractures, with a pooled sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 93.0-96.6%, P = 0.008), specificity of 98.3% (95% CI 97.00-99.0%), and a DOR of 1751.8 (95% CI 445.9-6882.5). The type of dataset used (validation vs. test, internal testing vs. external testing) did not significantly affect performance.Deep learning models can be considered a notably accurate method for the detection of ankle and foot fractures. Further studies with larger samples, external validation, and clinical implementations are required.This systematic review and meta-analysis study was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42024624044.© 2025.

41258098,Spatial multi-omics identifies aggressive prostate cancer signatures highlighting pro-inflammatory chemokine activity in the tumor microenvironment.,"Understanding the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. We interrogated spatially resolved multi-omics data to find molecular stratifiers of aggressive PCa. We report an aggressive prostate cancer (APC) gene expression signature predictive of increased risk of relapse and metastasis in a cohort of 1,588 patients. Further, we present a chemokine-enriched-gland (CEG) signature specific to non-cancerous prostatic glands from patients with aggressive cancer. The CEG signature is characterized by upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines, club-like cell enrichment, and immune cell infiltration of surrounding stroma. The activity of both signatures is correlated with reduced citrate and zinc levels and loss of normal prostate secretory gland functions. In summary we report that an increased inflammatory status linked to chemokine production, club-like cell enrichment, and metabolic changes in normal-appearing prostatic glands is associated with the subsequent development of aggressive PCa.© 2025.

41253179,Prospective clinical trial analyzing serum mast cell tryptase levels and arthrofibrosis rates after total knee arthroplasty.,"Arthrofibrosis affects a notable percentage of patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Elevated serum mast cell tryptase (SMCT) levels have been linked to fibrosis, suggesting that SMCT could serve as a biomarker for arthrofibrosis. As such, the aims of this study were to assess SMCT levels in TKA patients, and their possible association with arthrofibrosis and clinical outcomes in a prospective clinical trial.We conducted a prospective study involving 219 patients undergoing primary TKA at a single academic medical centre between January 2018 and December 2022. SMCT levels were measured preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at six weeks, three months, and one year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included revision rates, complications, and Knee Society Scores (KSSs). Allergic and inflammatory conditions were assessed for their influence on SMCT levels.At one year postoperatively, eight patients had developed arthrofibrosis (4%), and three (1.5%) had undergone manipulation under anaesthesia. The mean preoperative SMCT level was 5.6 µg/L (SD 3.4), which decreased significantly to 4.1 µg/L (SD 2.7) immediately postoperatively (p < 0.001). At six weeks the mean SMCT level was 6.4 µg/l (SD 4.1), and was 6.1 µg/l at both three months (SD 4.1) and one year (SD 4.0). Elevated preoperative SMCT levels were not significantly associated with the risk of arthrofibrosis development (OR 3; p = 0.370), nor were immediate postoperative levels (OR 2; p = 0.754) or those at six weeks (OR 1; p = 0.989). Of note, elevated SMCT levels at three months (OR 5; 95% CI 0.4 to 64; p = 0.191) and one year (OR 13; 95% CI 1 to 232; p = 0.077) trended toward an increased risk of arthrofibrosis development, without reaching significance.In patients undergoing TKA, with the numbers included in this study, there was no significant difference in SMCT levels between patients who did and did not develop arthrofibrosis at any timepoint. However, there was a trend towards elevated SMCT levels at three months and one year in those who developed arthrofibrosis, which merits further study.© 2025 Meissner et al.",Bone & joint research,"Nov 19, 2025",2025,Nov,19,Nils Meissner|Meagan E Tibbo|Dirk R Larson|Mark E Morrey|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Charles P Hannon|Daniel J Berry|Matthew P Abdel,Nils Meissner|Meagan E Tibbo|Dirk R Larson|Mark E Morrey|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Charles P Hannon|Daniel J Berry|Matthew P Abdel,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Nils Meissner, Meagan E Tibbo, Dirk R Larson, Mark E Morrey, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Charles P Hannon, Daniel J Berry, Matthew P Abdel",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41253179/
41258631,"Avascular necrosis in antiphospholipid syndrome: pathophysiology, risk factors, and management.","Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I. The updated 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria recognize microvascular features of APS but not orthopedic complications. Among these, avascular necrosis (AVN) is an uncommon and underrecognized manifestation, characterized by ischemic death of bone tissue, most often affecting the femoral head, knee, talus, and humeral head. The link between APS and AVN remains unclear and warrants further review.To explore the association between APS and AVN, focusing on its pathophysiology, prevalence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and management strategies.A comprehensive search was performed across medical databases, including PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar, using relevant keywords.AVN is a rare but significant complication of APS, with prevalence ranging from 0.9 to 20%, depending on the study design and population analyzed. The pathogenesis is primarily attributed to microvascular thrombosis and hypercoagulability caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. Identified risk factors include prolonged glucocorticoid use, thrombocytopenia, pregnancy, and underlying microvascular abnormalities. Early detection via MRI and timely interventions, such as anticoagulation therapy, lifestyle modifications, and surgical procedures, improve patient outcomes and prevent disease progression.Understanding the multifaceted nature of AVN in APS is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective management. Further research is needed to establish clear preventative strategies and optimize long-term treatment protocols, ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes.© 2025.

41258662,Prevalence of Malignancy Among Incidental Indeterminate Adrenal Nodules on Contrast-Enhanced CT in Patients Without Known Cancer: A Multiinstitutional Study.,"Background: Adrenal incidentalomas are common findings at contrast-enhanced CT, yet their management remains controversial. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of malignancy among incidental indeterminate adrenal nodules detected on contrast-enhanced CT in patients without known cancer. Methods: We performed a 12-institution retrospective cohort study of adult patients without known cancer who underwent contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen from January 1, 2010, to April 2, 2016. Consecutive reports from 10,646 cases were reviewed. CT images were reviewed for 2603 cases with reports describing an adrenal nodule measuring 1 cm or larger. Malignancy or benignity was determined using the following reference standards: pathology, diagnostic imaging (attenuation on unenhanced CT < 10 HU or signal-intensity loss at chemical shift MRI), imaging stability for at least 1 year, or clinical follow-up of at least 5 years. Descriptive statistics were performed using the binomial exact method and chi-square test. Results: The final cohort included 1320 patients (813 women, 507 men; mean age, 63.1 ± 15.2 years) with 1506 adrenal nodules. Mean nodule size was 2.1 cm ± 0.7 cm (range, 1.0-10.7 cm; IQR, 1.6-2.5 cm). The prevalence of malignancy among all nodules, nodules measuring 1-2 cm, nodules measuring 2-4 cm, and nodules measuring more than 4 cm was 0.07% (1/1506; 95% CI, 0.0-0.37%), 0.0% (0/773; 95% CI, 0.0-0.39%), 0.14% (1/694; 95% CI, 0.0-0.80%), and 0.0% (0/39; 95% CI, 0.0-7.4%). respectively. The one malignant nodule was an adrenocortical carcinoma diagnosed 9 years after initial detection. A total of 940 nodules underwent unenhanced CT after the index CT; all were benign. Of these, 654 were less than 10 HU, 157 were 10-20 HU, and 129 were more than 20 HU. Conclusion: The prevalence of malignancy among incidental indeterminate adrenal nodules on contrast-enhanced CT in patients without known cancer was exceedingly low. Clinical Impact: Follow-up imaging is not warranted for small (1-2 cm) incidental indeterminate adrenal nodules detected on contrast-enhanced CT in patients without known cancer.",AJR.

41258731,Long-term Outcomes of Long Head of the Triceps Transfer in Patients With Amyoplasia.,"Achieving active elbow flexion in children with amyoplasia can greatly improve independence in activities of daily living. This study investigated long-term outcomes of the long head triceps transfer procedure performed for that purpose.A retrospective review of medical records was performed for all patients with amyoplasia who underwent a long head triceps transfer between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019. Patients with follow-up of less than 2 years were excluded. Pre- and postoperative range of motion were recorded, and patient-reported outcome measures included a visual analog scale (VAS) for function (scale 0 to 10), a VAS for overall satisfaction (scale 0 to 10), and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). Pre- and postoperative motion were compared via paired t tests.Seventeen patients (25 extremities) were included. Postoperatively, average active elbow flexion was 78 degrees against gravity and 90 degrees with gravity eliminated. Patients with active elevation of the shoulder ≥90 degrees showed average active elbow flexion with gravity eliminated of 85 degrees. The mean VAS score for improvement of function was 8.3 (range, 4 to 10) from parents and 9.0 (range, 8 to 10) from patients older than 10 years. The mean VAS scores for overall satisfaction were 8.0 (range, 5 to 10) and 8.1 (range, 6 to 10), respectively. Mean PODCI scores ranged from 63 to 73 for upper extremity, 83 to 76 for transfer and basic mobility, 64 to 73 for sports participation, 83 to 95 for pain and comfort, 90 to 97 for happiness, and 74 to 79 for global function.The long head of the triceps transfer is an effective treatment modality for patients with amyoplasia who present with absent active elbow flexion, good passive elbow flexion, and well-defined long head and lateral heads of the triceps muscle. Overall, patients gained an active range of elbow motion with no significant functional elbow contracture and improved quality of life. However, patients with a history of elbow release surgery are at higher risk of flexion contracture and should be screened especially carefully.Level IV-case series.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41259271,Neurodevelopmental effects of genetic frontotemporal dementia mutations revealed by total intracranial volume differences.,"BackgroundConverging evidence hints at neurodevelopmental effects in people at risk of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD).ObjectiveWe investigated total intracranial volume (TIV), a neuroimaging marker of neurodevelopment, and years of education differences between adult mutation carriers and familial non-mutation carriers, as measures of the structural and functional neurodevelopmental effects of FTD-causing genetic mutations.MethodsThis cross-sectional cohort study, facilitated through the FTD Prevention Initiative (FPI), included 902 adult pathogenic mutation carriers of GRN, MAPT, or C9orf72, and 532 familial non-carriers. ANCOVAs were computed to compare TIV and education between groups per gene. Pearson's correlations were used to examine associations between TIV and education.ResultsMutation carriers (mean ± SD age = 50.0 ± 13.2 years, sex = 55% female, n(GRN) = 298, n(MAPT) = 187, n(C9orf72) = 417) were compared to familial non-carriers (age = 48.0 ± 12.9 years, sex = 58% female, n(GRN) = 201, n(MAPT) = 114), n(C9orf72) = 217). Consistent with prior findings in young adults, GRN carriers showed larger TIV, on average by 20531 mm3, compared to familial non-carriers (95% CI [85.4, 40977], p = 0.049, η2p = 0.008). Larger TIV correlated with higher years of education in GRN carriers (95% CI [0.01, 0.24], r(295) = 0.12, p = 0.03) and GRN non-carriers (95% CI [0.08, 0.34], r(198) = 0.21, p = 0.002). MAPT carriers demonstrated smaller TIV than non-carriers, on average by 29896 mm3 (95% CI [-58248, -1545], p = 0.039, η2p = 0.02). Models with C9orf72 and education as outcome variables did not reveal significant differences.ConclusionsIn support of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of FTD, GRN and MAPT mutations are linked to structural neurodevelopmental changes in TIV.

39357888,Braids and beyond: a comprehensive study on pipeline device braid stability from PREMIER data.,"The pipeline embolization device (PED) has been increasingly used to treat brain aneurysms; however, concerns have been raised about braid stability with newer drawn filled tubing technology devices.To evaluate braid stability of PED early generations using data from the PREMIER trial.All consecutive intracranial aneurysms treated with PED (Classic and Flex) within the PREMIER trial were reviewed for braid stability (fish mouthing, foreshortening, braid bump, braid collapsing). Immediate postprocedure cone-beam CT and angiography were compared with 1- and 2- years' follow-up. Analyses included safety, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, including +1 mRS point and a good clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2), vessel stenosis ≥50%, effectiveness measured with Raymond-Roy Scale, and re-treatment rates.133/141 aneurysms had a complete dataset. 8/133 (6%) aneurysms showed braid deformations. Inter-reader agreement was excellent (κ=0.83). Braid deformations were statistically significantly associated with in-stent vessel stenosis >50% (P=0.029), without impact on effectiveness or safety. Fish mouthing was found in 1/133 (0.75%) at 1 year, causing >50% vessel stenosis. Foreshortening occurred in 6/133 (4.5%), and braid bump in 1/133 (0.75%) associated with severe in-stent stenosis. Four other cases (3.0%) of asymptomatic in-stent stenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia were seen without braid changes. No new braid stability deformations were found at the 2-year follow-up.Our study demonstrates excellent braid stability among patients treated with the PED Classic and Flex in the PREMIER trial. Within the uncommon braid changes observed, none affected the PED safety or efficacy.NCT02186561.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

39366733,Comparing stand-alone endovascular embolization versus stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III: a propensity score matched study.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon cerebral lesions that can cause significant neurological complications. Surgical resection is the gold standard for treatment, but endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are viable alternatives.To compare the outcomes of endovascular embolization versus SRS in the treatment of AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III.This study combined retrospective data from 10 academic institutions in North America and Europe. Patients aged 1 to 90 years who underwent endovascular embolization or SRS for AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III between January 2010 and December 2023 were included.The study included 244 patients, including 84 who had endovascular embolization and 160 who had SRS. Before propensity score matching (PSM), complete obliteration at the last follow-up was achieved in 74.5% of the SRS group compared with 57.8% of the embolization group (OR=0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.48; P=0.01). After propensity score matching, SRS still achieved significantly higher occlusion rates at last follow-up (78.9% vs 55.3%; OR=0.32; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90; P=0.03).Hemorrhagic complications were higher in the embolization group than in the SRS group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance after PSM (13.2% vs 2.6%; OR=5.6; 95% CI 0.62 to 50.47; P=0.12). Similarly, re-treatment rate was higher in the embolization group (10.5% vs 5.3%; OR=2.11; 95% CI 0.36 to 12.31; P=0.40) compared with the SRS group.Our findings indicate that SRS has a significantly higher obliteration rate at last follow-up compared with endovascular embolization. Also, SRS has a higher tendency for fewer hemorrhagic complications and lower re-treatment rate. Further prospective studies are needed.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. No commercial re-use.

39424305,Transcranial doppler (TCD) in predicting outcomes following successful mechanical thrombectomy of large vessel occlusions in anterior circulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive, bedside tool that allows for real-time monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status following mechanical thrombectomy (MT). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the predictive value of TCD parameters following successful MT (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3).In July 2024, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, to identify observational studies in which TCD parameters were measured within 48 hours of MT. Using random-effects models, we compared four TCD parameters (mean flow velocity (MFV), MFV index, pulsatility index (PI), and peak systolic velocity (PSV) among groups with vs without hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and favorable vs poor functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 vs 3-6).Eleven studies comprising 1432 patients (59% male; mean age range: 63-73 years) were included. The MFV and MFV index were higher in patients with HT (Hedges' g=0.42 and 0.54, P=0.015 and 0.005, respectively). Patients with MFV index ≥1.3 showed a higher risk of all HT (RR 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.03, P=0.002), symptomatic HT (RR 4.68; 95% CI 1.49 to 14.65, P=0.008), and poor functional status at 90 days (RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.14, P=0.029), respectively. There was no difference in mean PSV (P=0.1) and PI (P=0.3) among groups with and without HT.This study underscores the prognostic value of the MFV index in predicting HT, symptomatic HT, and poor functional recovery after successful MT in the anterior circulation. Large-scale, multi-center studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to validate the MFV index as a reliable predictor for improving post-thrombectomy care.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with chronic hypoPT had higher risk of valvular heart disease [hazard ratio (HR) 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-2.60], peripheral artery disease (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.41-2.26), heart failure (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.44-1.90), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.38-1.81), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.05-1.64), and fatal cardiovascular disease (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.40-1.80) compared to matched controls. No significant difference in risk of stroke/TIA was observed. Cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between patients with surgical and nonsurgical chronic hypoPT. Females with hypoPT had a significantly increased risk of valvular heart disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and fatal cardiovascular disease compared to female controls. There were no differences in any cardiovascular outcomes between males with hypoPT and male controls.The risk of cardiovascular diseases was increased in patients with chronic hypoPT, particularly among women. These findings highlight the need for close monitoring and preventive management of cardiovascular risk factors, especially in women.© The Author(s) 2025.

40960442,Is Type 2 Diabetes a Modifiable Risk Factor for the Evolution and Progression of Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but it is not clear whether this metabolic disorder is causal or represents a modifiable risk factor. Mechanisms by which diabetes may be associated with HFpEF can be grouped into the following: 1) those related to hyperglycemia and amenable to antihyperglycemic drugs; and 2) those related to the association of type 2 diabetes with obesity and visceral adiposity, and thus, treatable with interventions that reduce adipose tissue mass or improve adipocyte biology.Experimentally, acute and chronic hyperglycemia caused by islet cell destruction can lead to cardiac dysfunction, but these models resemble type 1 (not type 2) diabetes. Heightened levels of environmental glucose can cause enzymatic or nonenzymatic modification of proteins and signaling through the polyol pathway, but interference with these mechanisms has not produce clinical benefits in patients with heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, lowering of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes with insulin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones has not reduced the risk of heart failure.In marked contrast, experimental models that link type 2 diabetes to HFpEF are typically accompanied by excess adiposity. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the association between type 2 diabetes and HFpEF is mediated primarily through a common link with central obesity and an expanded visceral fat mass. Changes in the biology of adipocytes as a result of visceral adiposity are sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and diabetes. Interestingly, the primary metabolic defect in the diabetic heart is lipid overload, not an impairment in glucose uptake or insulin resistance. Adiposity can promote HFpEF through the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines that lead to sodium retention and cardiac steatosis and fibrosis. Additionally, excess adiposity can drive the production of and enhance cardiac sensitivity to advanced glycation end products. Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter reduce the risk or progression of HFpEF, but this benefit is not related by the presence of diabetes or to the glucose-lowering effects of these drugs. Instead, their favorable cardiac effects may be mediated by their action to induce or mimic a state of caloric deprivation, thus restoring adipokine balance and alleviating the state of cardiac steatosis. Similarly, bariatric surgery alleviates both visceral adiposity and type 2 diabetes and reduces the risk of HFpEF.Taken together, these findings suggest that diabetes-associated HFpEF is mediated primarily through its association with excess adiposity. Diabetes is a modifiable risk factor if treatment is directed toward adiposity rather than hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41031977,Central Adiposity or Hypertension: Which Drives Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction?,"The 2 most prevalent risk factors for the development of heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are hypertension and obesity, but their relative importance in driving the evolution and progression of HFpEF has not been critically evaluated. The role of excess adiposity in HFpEF has been substantially underappreciated, largely because of reliance on body mass index (rather than waist-to-height ratio) to identify an expanded fat mass and on a meaningful elevation of natriuretic peptides to identify HFpEF. In the general population, changes in central obesity and visceral adiposity are observed years before HFpEF becomes clinically manifest, and central obesity is present in >80% to 90% of patients with established HFpEF, with the degree of adiposity being strongly related to the hemodynamic and clinical severity of HFpEF. Therapeutic amelioration of excess adiposity by bariatric surgery or incretin-based drugs appears to have substantial effects on the evolution and progression of HFpEF, with reported reductions of 40% to 60% in the risk of heart failure hospitalizations. Hypertension also increases the risk of heart failure, but in Mendelian randomization studies, HFpEF is more strongly linked to obesity than to hypertension. Furthermore, the available evidence from clinical trials does not support a consistent link between blood pressure lowering and a reduced risk of HFpEF, particularly in patients with coexisting obesity. Although a history of hypertension is exceptionally prevalent among patients with established HFpEF, in trials of patients with established HFpEF, drugs that lowered systolic blood pressure by 3 to 7 mm Hg yielded a heart failure event risk reduction of only 5% to 18%. Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed benefit on heart failure events was not related to the elevation of baseline systolic blood pressure or the magnitude of the drug-related decreases in blood pressure. Adiposity causes hypertension, and if excess adiposity is not alleviated, blood pressure lowering with many antihypertensive drugs may not be able to alleviate left ventricular systolic and diastolic and vascular stiffness. Taken together, the totality of evidence suggests that-in the current era-central adiposity appears to be more important than hypertension as a determinant of the evolution and progression of HFpEF.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41091083,Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients With Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction: The Underlying Role of Visceral Adiposity.,"It has been hypothesized that an impairment of kidney function may contribute to the development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the conventional threshold for the identification of intrinsic renal disease in HFpEF (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) does not consider age-related physiological changes. When adjusted for age, the appropriate threshold is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, leading to a prevalence of impaired glomerular function of ≈15% to 25% among patients with HFpEF. However, even this estimate of chronic kidney disease is inflated, since heart failure and its treatments lead to reversible changes in renal perfusion, renal venous pressures, and intrarenal hemodynamic changes, which do not reflect structural kidney disease. Accordingly, the risk of end-stage kidney disease in patients with HFpEF is exceptionally low, ie, <0.5% annually, far lower than the risk of death. It is generally assumed that hypertension and diabetes are the most important modifiable risk factors for the development of kidney disease in patients with HFpEF. However, in large-scale trials, pharmacological efforts to lower blood pressure or blood glucose have not had favorable effects on glomerular function or the risk of end-stage kidney disease. Instead, the principal driver of chronic kidney disease in patients with HFpEF appears to be obesity and visceral adiposity. Both obesity and visceral adiposity are accompanied by neurohormonal activation and imbalances in adipokine secretion that are established causal mechanisms-not only of HFpEF-but also of glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis-actions that are potentially augmented by increases in the mass of adipose tissue surrounding the kidneys. Alleviation of obesity and visceral adiposity with the use of bariatric surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduces the risk of both HFpEF and major adverse kidney outcomes. The sodium avidity and systemic inflammation seen in patients with HFpEF are not attributable to the presence of intrinsic renal disease, but are likely related to neurohormonal and adipokine-mediated pathways that are driven by secretions from an expanded fat mass.

41195764,Noninvasive Evaluation of Ventricular Filling Pressure and Pulmonary Vascular Reserve in Adults With Fontan Circulation.,"Exercise cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing diastolic dysfunction and impaired pulmonary reserve in patients with Fontan circulation. The diagnostic value of noninvasive parameters is unclear.Patients who underwent simultaneous exercise hemodynamic evaluation and peripheral venous pressure (PVP) measurement were included. Echocardiographic surrogates for ventricular filling pressure were compared with invasive measures. Diastolic dysfunction was defined invasively as either resting pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≥12 mm Hg or exercise pulmonary artery wedge pressure >20 mm Hg.Twenty-nine patients were included. Age at catheterization was 34±9 years. Atrioventricular valve systole-to-diastole duration ratio (S/D) and resting PVP were significant predictors of resting pulmonary artery wedge pressure (S/D: β=0.71 per 0.1 S/D [95% CI, 0.16-1.25]; P=0.01; PVP: β=0.68 per mm Hg [95% CI, 0.41-0.96]; P<0.001). By contrast, resting PVP was a predictor of diastolic dysfunction, whereas S/D was not. Based on these data, we proposed a 2-tier assessment algorithm with the first tier considering resting PVP ≤15 mm Hg and S/D ≤1.1 and the second tier considering exercise PVP ≤25 mm Hg in those with 1 elevated resting parameter. This algorithm showed a positive predictive value of 88% (95% CI, 47%-100%), a negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI, 70%-99%), a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI, 40%-97%), and a specificity of 95% (95% CI, 75%-100%). Exercise PVP indexed to peak oxygen consumption also predicted invasively measured exercise pulmonary vascular resistance index (β=0.36 WU·m2 per mm Hg/100 mL per min [95% CI, 0.08-0.64]; P=0.01).This study presents a simple, noninvasive approach for evaluating diastolic function and pulmonary vascular reserve in patients with a Fontan circulation.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Nov 18, 2025",2025,Nov,18,Jacob Y Cao|C C Jain|Alexander C Egbe|Yogesh NV Reddy|Clare O'Donnell|David Baker|David Celermajer|William Miranda|Rachael Cordina,C C Jain|Alexander C Egbe|Yogesh NV Reddy|William Miranda,Department of Cardiology Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Sydney Australia.|Sydney Medical School University of Sydney Sydney Australia.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Mayo Clinic Rochester MN USA.|Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology Starship Children's/Auckland City Hospitals Auckland New Zealand.,"Jacob Y Cao, C C Jain, Alexander C Egbe, Yogesh NV Reddy, Clare O'Donnell, David Baker, David Celermajer, William Miranda, Rachael Cordina",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41195764/
41220156,"Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, Remodeling, and Outcome in Patients With Amyloid Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy.","Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) has a specific pathophysiology, with myocardial stiffening and systolic dysfunction only in advanced stages. We aimed to investigate the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in ATTR-CM compared with heart failure.In this multicenter, observational study, patients with ATTR-CM receiving CRT (n=101) were matched to patients without amyloid cardiomyopathy by sex, age, and implantation type (CRT with versus without defibrillator versus conduction system pacing, upgrade versus first implant). We evaluated changes in QRS duration and echocardiographic parameters following CRT implantation and at the most recent available assessments. The study end points were all-cause death alone or combined with heart failure hospitalization.Patients with ATTR-CM (median age, 76 [interquartile range, 72-83] years, 98% men, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 30% [26-33]) showed greater QRS shortening after CRT implantation (P=0.012), but not after a median of around 1 year (P=0.152). There were no significant differences in the absolute LV ejection fraction changes immediately after implantation (+7 [+2/+10] versus +3 [0/+9] units; P=0.124), or to the last echo (P=0.796), which was performed after 1.3 years in patients with ATTR-CM and 2.9 years in patients without amyloid cardiomyopathy. Patients with ATTR-CM had a shorter survival than controls (P<0.001 for both end points). Patients with ATTR-CM experiencing an early improvement in LV ejection fraction had a longer survival (log-rank, 4.3; P=0.038).Following CRT implantation, patients with ATTR-CM show QRS narrowing and improvement in LV ejection fraction, not different from patients without amyloid cardiomyopathy.

41251650,Ambient Artificial Intelligence Versus Human Scribes in the Emergency Department.,"To compare the use of ambient artificial intelligence (AI) versus human scribes in the emergency department in terms of note quality and time spent in the electronic health record.A quality improvement pilot was performed with 5 early adopters from December 2024 to January 2025. Physicians were assigned to a human or AI scribe. Two physicians, blinded to the chart's origin, scored notes using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). We accessed our electronic health record for time metrics and note contributions and compared PDQI-9 scores, time metrics, and note contribution between groups.There were 710 visits, 284 with human scribes (123 adult and 161 pediatric) and 426 with AI-assisted charting (271 adult, 155 pediatric). PDQI-9 scores were similar for adults, but AI scribes scored lower for pediatric patients (41.36 versus 42.25, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = -1.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.58 to -0.20]). More time in the electronic health record notes section per patient was spent when using AI scribes (adult: 4.3 versus 1.8 minutes, aRR = 2.38 [95% CI 1.85 to 3.05]; pediatric: 3.5 versus 1.6 minutes, aRR = 2.21 [95% CI 1.94 to 2.51]). Note length was similar but physicians contributed significantly more characters per note when using AI (adult: 60.1% versus 30.8%, adjusted mean differences = 32.9 [95% CI 20.8 to 45.0]; pediatric: 62.3% versus 27.1%, adjusted mean differences = 35.2 [95% CI 29.7 to 40.7]).In comparison to human scribes, AI scribes were associated with more time spent in the electronic health record notes section, more physician note contribution, and similar to lower quality notes.Copyright © 2025 American College of Emergency Physicians.

41225295,Socioeconomic status and concussion recovery in young athletes.,"Socioeconomic status (SES) may be associated with time to return to play (RTP) after sport-related concussion (SRC), but the literature is limited and has yielded mixed results. The purpose of our study was to determine the association between SES and concussion recovery in high school and middle school athletes.High school and middle school athletes from 24 schools in southeast Minnesota who sustained a SRC between 2020 and 2023 were included in this study. Data obtained for each concussion included date of injury and date of clearance to complete a RTP protocol. A validated measure of SES, HOUSES (HOUsing-based index of SES), was used to determine SES by pairing home addresses to publicly available property data. SES was divided into four quartiles determined for the region (Q1 = lowest SES quartile, Q4 = highest SES quartile). A negative-bimodal regression model was used to analyze the relationship between SES and RTP time.A total of 132 athletes (mean age 15.9 ± 1.5 years, 75.0% male) were included in the study. Among the total cohort, median RTP time was 12.0 days. Within each HOUSES quartile, median RTP time was 16 days in Q1, 12 days in Q2, 13 days in Q3, and 11 days in Q4. After adjusting for sex, race, ethnicity, and prior diagnosis of migraines, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, and mood disorder, athletes were estimated to have 23.9% fewer recovery days for each 1-unit increase in HOUSES quartile (p < 0.001).RTP time after concussion may be related to SES in young athletes, with higher SES associated with shorter RTP timelines.",The Physician and sportsmedicine,"Nov 18, 2025",2025,Nov,18,Liga A Kreitner|Eric M Crowley|Roland C Hentz|Chung I Wi|David B Soma,Liga A Kreitner|Eric M Crowley|Roland C Hentz|Chung I Wi|David B Soma,"Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Orthopedics - Division of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences - Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic,Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Community Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Liga A Kreitner, Eric M Crowley, Roland C Hentz, Chung I Wi, David B Soma",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41225295/
41246814,Reduced Circulating α-Klotho Levels Are Associated With Elevated Mortality and Arterial Calcifications of Aorta and Iliac Arteries.,"α-Klotho is a multifunctional protein implicated in vascular aging. Declining Klotho levels are associated with arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular calcification. We investigated the associations between circulating klotho, aortoiliac calcification, endothelial progenitor cells, and 10-year survival.In this retrospective cohort, blinded clinicians scored calcification on computed tomography (0-10 scale: aorta 6 points, iliac 4 points). Plasma klotho was measured by ELISA; endothelial progenitor cell subsets were quantified via flow cytometry. Mortality data were obtained from the Minnesota Death Registry.This study included 148 participants (mean age 72.4±9.6 years; 41% female). Median calcification score was 3 (interquartile range, 1-5). Patients with low calcification had higher Klotho levels (669 [567-841] versus 556 [457-678] pg/mL; P<0.01), with Klotho inversely correlated with calcification (r=-0.315, P<0.01). Stratified by calcification location and severity, the highest Klotho levels were seen in patients without aortic or iliac calcification (P=0.015). Over 10 years, low Klotho was independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 3.056 [95% CI 1.288-7.878]; P=0.014). Klotho inversely correlated with mature osteocalcin-positive EPCs; B=-0.16 (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.02; P=0.027).

41254208,Uncertainty-aware large language models for explainable disease diagnosis.,"Explainable disease diagnosis, which leverages patient information (e.g., symptoms) and computational models to generate probable diagnoses and reasoning, holds strong clinical promise. Yet, when clinical notes lack sufficient evidence for a definitive diagnosis, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty commonly arises, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Despite its importance, the explicit identification and explanation of diagnostic uncertainty remain under-explored in artificial intelligence-driven systems. To fill this gap, we introduce ConfiDx, an uncertainty-aware large language model fine-tuned with diagnostic criteria. We formalized the task of uncertainty-aware diagnosis and curated richly annotated datasets that reflect varying degrees of diagnostic ambiguity. Evaluating on real-world datasets demonstrated that ConfiDx excelled in identifying diagnostic uncertainties, achieving superior diagnostic performance, and generating trustworthy explanations for diagnoses and uncertainties. Moreover, ConfiDx-assisted experts outperformed standalone experts by 10.7% in uncertainty recognition and 26% in uncertainty explanation, underscoring its substantial potential to improve clinical decision-making.© 2025.

41254554,Misaligned perspectives and experiences: a qualitative study of older patients with suboptimal Dialysis initiation and their clinicians.,"A person-centred approach is a key component of comprehensive high-quality nephrology care. However, the unpredictable nature of an acute or unplanned initiation of chronic haemodialysis treatment poses a challenge for meeting this patient group in a person-centred manner. Yet, little is known about the person-centred practices of clinical encounters prior to and along these suboptimal dialysis initiation (SDI) pathways. This study aimed to explore the patient and clinician perspectives on how these encounters unfold among older adults aged ≥ 65 years, receiving SDI.The study builds on an ethnographic approach encompassing participant observation of clinical encounters during eight workdays and narrative interviews with 14 SDI patients aged ≥ 65 in combination with two focus group discussions with seven renal nurses and five nephrologists. This study was conducted at a specialized nephrology department at a tertiary hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark.The results shed light on the existence and impact of 'predefined' encounters, encompassing various aspects such as the agenda of conversations during encounters, and the logical sequencing of nephrology care pathways. In the two key themes 'Predefined' agendas: lost in translation, and The optimal CKD pathway: what happens when?, we illustrate how the acute and unpredictable nature of SDIs challenge the 'predefined' encounter format. Thereby, the clinical encounters become misaligned with the needs and preferences of each patient, no longer responding in a person-centred manner.Clinicians pressed for time face challenges in responding to diverse patient needs in clinical SDI encounters. Existing 'predefined' agendas and logical sequencing have evolved to support clinicians in reaching clinical endpoints but fall short when SDI patients' particular and dynamic perspectives does not fit the standard. To truly facilitate person-centred care, the flexibility of encounters and the overall nephrology care pathways should be improved to ensure that encounters are responsive to and reflect individual patient preferences, contexts, and needs.Not applicable.© 2025.

39304195,Improved technical outcomes with converting thrombectomy techniques after failed first pass recanalization.,"A higher number of recanalization attempts reduces the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion (LVO). We assessed the impact of switching EVT techniques after a failed first pass on procedural and clinical outcomes.This multicenter international study, conducted between January 2013 and December 2022, included patients undergoing EVT for anterior circulation LVO (internal carotid artery or M1 segments) with failed first pass recanalization. Propensity score matching identified a 1:1 matched cohort of patients in whom EVT technique was changed after a failed first pass and those with the same technique repeated. The primary outcome was successful recanalization at second attempt defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) score of 2B or higher. Secondary outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Score (mRS) and postprocedural hemorrhage.Among 2167 patients, converting to an alternative technique after a failed first pass was associated with higher odds of successful recanalization (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.5, p=0.041), and higher odds of mRS 0-2 at 90 days (aOR=1.6, p=0.005) without additional risk of symptomatic hemorrhage (p=0.379). Using a propensity score matched cohort of 490 patients, technique conversion at second attempt increased odds of successful recanalization at second attempt (aOR=1.32, p=0.006) and 90-day mRS 0-2 (aOR=1.38, p=0.008).Early conversion to an alternative EVT technique after a failed first pass recanalization in patients with AIS is associated with better technical success and clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.
