41167636,Efficacy of immunotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) tumors with mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) unusual phenotype: an AGEO real-world study.,"Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) classically display concomitant loss of MLH1/PMS2 or MSH2/MSH6 on immunohistochemistry (IHC) with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-High) status on molecular testing. Nevertheless, a different phenotype can occur in up to 15% of MMRd tumors (unusual phenotype). Data on the efficacy of immunotherapy in this population remain scarce.We conducted a retrospective study within the IMMUNODIG MSI cohort including patients with advanced gastrointestinal MMRd tumors treated with immune checkpoint blockade in the real-world setting. We selected patients with both IHC and MSI assays data available. Unusual MMRd tumors were classified into four distinct groups: (1) isolated loss of PMS2 or MSH6 with MSI-H (isolated/MSI-H), (2) complex loss of MMR proteins with MSI-H (complex/MSI-H), (3) loss of one or more MMR proteins without MSI-H (MMRd-IHC/microsatellite stability (MSS) or MSI-low (MSI-L)), and (4) four MMR proteins retained with MSI-H (retained IHC/MSI-H).Out of 759 patients in the IMMUNODIG-MSI cohort, 571 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 90 (15.8%) had an unusual phenotype (47 isolated/MSI-H, 19 complex/MSI-H, 16 MMRd-IHC/MSS or MSI-L and 8 retained IHC/MSI-H). Compared with classical phenotypes, patients with a tumor harboring an unusual phenotype had a younger age at treatment (p=0.005), increased RAS mutation (p=0.005), reduced BRAF p.V600E mutation rates (p<0.001), a higher proportion of Lynch syndrome (p<0.001) and a higher prevalence of non-colorectal cancers (p=0.021). After a median follow-up of 28.1 months (mo), there was a significant difference in progression-free survival, with median values of not reached, 66.4 mo, 37.2 mo, 18.3 mo and 5.5 mo for complex/MSI-H, isolated/MSI-H, classical, retained IHC/MSI-H and MMRd-IHC/MSS or MSI-L subgroups, respectively (p<0.001). Notably, objective response rates were 59.1%, 58.7%, and 63.2% for complex/MSI-H, isolated/MSI-H and classical contrasting with 50% and 25% for retained IHC/MSI-H and MMRd-IHC/MSS or MSI-L, with no complete response observed in the latter two.Our findings underscore the need for dual testing and advocate for the presence of both MMRd-IHC and MSI-H for optimal immunotherapy response. Of note, complex MMR aberrations and isolated PMS2/MSH6 losses with MSI-H may represent promising candidates for enhanced immunotherapy efficacy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

40586687,"Foam sclerotherapy for symptomatic cysts in ADPKD, ADPLD and solitary cysts.","This medical center migrated from alcohol to sotradecol foam sclerotherapy (SFS) because of perceived improved efficacy in managing symptomatic kidney and liver cysts. We report technical aspects, change in short- and long-term cyst volumes, patient-reported outcomes, safety and applications of the technique.In this retrospective observational study, cases from January 2017 to December 2021 had TKCV/TLCV (per Targeted Kidney or Liver or Cyst analysis) segmented using a deep-learning algorithm and cyst segmentation software (pre-, post-procedure and longitudinally). TKCV/TLCV % change were evaluated using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. For analyses involving changes in cyst volumes, the median % change in cyst volume per patient was assessed. Longitudinal changes in cyst volumes were assessed using linear mixed models. Changes in quality of life (QOL) [Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA), Polycystic Liver Disease Quality of life Questionnaire (PLD-Q) and 12-item short-form (SF12)] were also assessed.There were 102 SFS sessions (38 kidney, 58 liver, 6 combined liver/kidney cysts) performed on 77 unique individuals included for analysis. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] % reductions in TKCV were -92.0% (IQR -98.2%, -82.7%, P < .001) and for TLCV were -83.1% (IQR -93.5%, -52.9%, P < .001). Among patients with multiple kidney procedures (n = 7), median % reduction in TKCV was -94.3% (IQR -96.6%, -92.4%, P = .023). For patients with multiple liver procedures (n = 11), median % reduction in TLCV was -63.3% (IQR -85.2%, -28.3%, P = .004). Results were similar among the four patients undergoing multi-stage procedures (n = 1 kidney, n = 3 liver). When measured longitudinally, both liver and kidney cyst volumes declined to levels near 0 mL by 1 year follow-up and remained stable several years later. LASA physical domain and PLD-Q QOL scores improved post-SFS procedure.SFS led to substantial long-term reductions in TKCV/TLCV and improved QOL. SFS can augment cyst volume reduction in addition to tolvaptan (kidney cysts) and octreotide (liver cysts). In some individuals with large symptomatic cysts, multiple SFS procedures were safe and effective in reducing TLCV/TKCV and improving symptoms.© The Author(s) 2025.

40663785,Real-world outcomes of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma treated with epcoritamab or glofitamab.,"Epcoritamab and glofitamab are CD20-directed bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) approved in the United States for relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Limited data exist for patients treated outside of trials. Patients with R/R DLBCL receiving commercial epcoritamab or glofitamab between 1 January 2023 and 15 October 2024 were collected from 21 United States institutions. Among 245 patients, 156 received epcoritamab and 89 received glofitamab, 113 were refractory to front-line therapy, 40 had MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, 147 received prior chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and 174 patients would have been ineligible for registrational trials. The overall response rate (ORR) for epcoritamab and glofitamab was 51% (23% complete response, [CR]) and 53% (30% CR), respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-3.8 months), and median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-11.0 months). The 6-month PFS was 36% (95% CI, 30-44) and the 6-month OS was 60% (95% CI, 54-67). Both trial ineligibility and undetectable CD20 pre-BsAbs portended shorter PFS and OS. Of 17 individuals with paired biopsies, 15 (88.2%) lost CD20 expression after BsAbs with a median time to progression of 3.7 months. This analysis including patients with R/R DLBCL shows the ORR to CD3/CD20 BsAbs was comparable to pivotal trials, although PFS and OS were lower. Baseline undetectable levels of CD20 were associated with poor outcomes. These results demonstrate the activity of BsAbs in R/R DLBCL, and underscore the importance of target antigen expression.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41161689,Decentralized Biobanking to Empower Patient Engagement in Biospecimen Research: Operational Feasibility Case Study.,"Background: Biobanks often lack standard mechanisms to keep donors connected to their biospecimens, reflecting a broken feedback loop that compromises trust, engagement, and scientific progress. Decentralized biobanking empowers patients to track their donations throughout the research journey, supporting personalized feedback and research collaboration via a privacy-preserving blockchain network. This case study explores operational feasibility of implementing decentralized biobanking for a large breast cancer biobank at a US academic medical center. Methods: A mixed-methods case study of the groundwork, implementation, and stakeholder feedback for a real-world decentralized biobanking app pilot was conducted. Biobank members were recruited from February to April 2023. Operational feasibility was assessed via analysis of institutional stakeholder perspectives, pilot engagement, and de-bi app activity. Findings: Physicians and other biobank stakeholders surfaced challenges surrounding managing expectations, balancing empowerment with clinical and research workflows, and navigating power dynamics between patients, physicians, scientists, and leadership. A total of 1080 participants enrolled over 10 weeks, including nearly 10% of the biobank with about 4000 biospecimens. During the pilot, biobank enrollment increased 65% versus the prior year, and there were no biobank withdrawals during or within 1 year following the pilot (p < 0.001 for both). The app, which facilitated biospecimen tracking and research engagement, was downloaded by 405 users. A total of 140 users tested the blockchain component, with 89% successfully claiming a nonfungible token representing their unique, immutable connection and access to donated biospecimens. Feedback was solicited to inform potential process improvements and risk assessments related to public relations, systems infrastructure, and ethical governance, illuminating next steps. Conclusions: We established operational feasibility for the first step toward decentralized biobanking, informed by requirements to manage expectations, workflows, and power dynamics. Our technical solution demonstrated robust participant engagement and compatibility with established biobanks, suggesting potential to build trust and align incentives and identifying next steps for communications, sustainability, and governance.",Biopreservation and biobanking,"Oct 30, 2025",2025,Oct,30,Dewan A|Altiery De Jesus V|Budd E|Sanchez W L|Kahn J|Miller R C|Macis M|Gross M,Miller R C,"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|Johns Hopkins University Berman Institute of Bioethics, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, New York, USA.|de-bi, co., Greencastle, Pennsylvania, USA.|Mayo Clinic, Department of Radiation Oncology, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.|Johns Hopkins University Carey School of Business, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.","Dewan A, Altiery De Jesus V, Budd E, Sanchez W L, Kahn J, Miller R C, Macis M, Gross M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41161689/,"The key finding of this medical research is that decentralized biobanking, which allows patients to track their donated biospecimens and collaborate in research, is operationally feasible.

41163019,Intra-articular delivery of allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) for painful lumbar facet arthropathy: a phase I clinical trial.,"Lumbar facet arthropathy (LFA) is one of the most common specific disorders associated with low back pain. Current treatments provide only symptomatic relief and are often limited in their long-term effectiveness.To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of intra-articular delivery of allogeneic BM-MSCs in patients with painful LFA.This study was a prospective, Phase I, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. Ten patients with painful LFA were enrolled with nine completing the 2-year follow-up.All patients received a single intra-articular administration into two affected lumbar facet joints, with each joint injected 10 million allogeneic BM-MSCs suspended in 1 mL Lactated Ringer's solution.The primary endpoint was safety, as reflected by adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints (and the assessment tools) included low back pain (VAS), physical function (PROMIS CAT Physical Function), health status (PROMIS CATs), and the severity of facet joint degeneration on MRIs. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in this trial were pre-defined as a 50% reduction in low back pain (VAS), or an increase of 2.3 points on the PROMIS CAT Physical Function.The procedures were well tolerated. There were no clinical signs of immune reaction to the allogeneic BM-MSCs. No study-related serious AEs were observed. Six patients achieved the MCID on VAS for pain at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-ups and five patients consistently met MCID for the PROMIS CAT Physical Function across all follow-up visits. MRIs showed reduced facet joint degeneration at one or more levels in five patients.This study demonstrated a favorable safety profile for intra-articular delivery of BM-MSCs for painful LFA. Preliminary therapeutic benefits were observed, including back pain relief, improved physical function, and reduced facet joint degeneration. Further larger, randomized clinical trials are warranted to further assess its safety and efficacy. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04410731.© 2025.

41165266,International Clinical Cytometry Society 2023 workload survey of clinical flow cytometry laboratories.,"Clinical flow cytometry laboratories are facing rising test volumes, greater assay complexity, and increasing requirements for quality control and assay validation. In response, the International Clinical Cytometry Society (ICCS) conducted a workload survey in early 2023 to gather updated information on assay volumes, complexity, staffing, and technology. Data analysis focused on identifying correlations between length of time to introduce new assays and other factors as a means to gain insight about laboratories that seem to be either adapting or struggling. Flow cytometry assays were categorized into 3 levels of technical/interpretative complexity: high (e.g., measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD assays)), moderate (e.g., leukemia/lymphoma assays (AssaysL&L), excluding MRD assays), and low (e.g., CD4 count). Annual assays per staff member were calculated according to staff involved in case sign-out (StaffSignout) or other laboratory operations (StaffLabOps). Respondents were from 101 laboratories in the United States (69.3%), Canada (4.0%), and other countries (26.7%). Low, moderate, and high technical/interpretative complexity assays were performed in 85.1%, 97.0%, and 47.5% of all laboratories, respectively. Median annual total assays (AssaysTotal) per laboratory were 3515 and, based on complexity, were 1518.5 (low), 1808.8 (moderate), and 350 (high). Among all laboratories, the median time (interquartile range) to introduce new AssaysL&L was 6 mos. (4-12 mos.), to introduce MRD assays was 11 mos. (5-12 mos.), and to validate/go-live with new cytometers was 8 mos. (4-12 mos.); these times positively correlated with each other. This study confirmed significantly increased workload since the prior ICCS 2013 workload survey with a concurrent decrease in StaffLabOps. Faster introduction of new assays correlated with other successes, including quicker validation of and going live with new cytometers. Among all laboratories, those that performed myeloid MRD assays versus those that did not were also found to be faster to introduce new assays. The need for sufficient staffing has been emphasized because laboratories with both higher annual volumes of myeloma MRD assays and higher ratios of AssaysTotal per StaffLabOps were slower to introduce new assays. ""Lack of staff and/or time dedicated or protected for assay development"" and, more generally, ""staff number"" were the most commonly identified major barriers for new assay development, with the former specifically linked to slower introduction of new assays among all laboratories.© 2025 International Clinical Cytometry Society.","Cytometry.

Design: Retrospective cohort study using the 2019-2023 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Setting: Multicenter surgical registry of pediatric operations. Patients: Children undergoing CL repair (<1 year) or CP repair (<3 years). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence of UIE, demographic and operative characteristics, and 30-day postoperative complications. Results: Among 17 047 cases, UIE occurred in 0.37% of CL repairs and 0.20% of CP repairs. Patients who experienced UIE had similar baseline characteristics to those without UIE but demonstrated significantly longer operative and anesthesia times for both procedures. Despite these intraoperative events, no cases of death, pneumonia, or unplanned reintubation occurred postoperatively, and overall 30-day complication rates remained low.

41165571,A prognostic signature for lung adenocarcinoma in patients who have never smoked.,"Understanding tumor cell dynamics can improve prognosis and treatment but remains limited for lung adenocarcinoma in people who have never smoked (NS-LUAD). With RNA-seq data from 684 NS-LUAD and validation in an independent dataset, we identified three subtypes with distinct phenotypic traits and cell compositions. Additional genomic and histological data further characterized the subtypes. 'Steady', marked by low proliferation, high alveolar cell fraction, moderate-to-well differentiation, and fewer driver genes' alterations, is linked to prolonged survival and low immune evasion. 'Proliferative' shows high proliferation markers, TP53 mutations, and gene fusions. 'Chaotic', with high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, has the worst prognosis even within stage I tumors. Lacking known molecular or histological characteristics, this aggressive subtype is solely identified by transcriptomic data. A 60-gene signature recapitulates the classification and predicts survival even within subgroups based on tumor stage or known genomic features, emphasizing its potential for improving early-stage NS-LUAD prognostication in clinical settings.",Cancer discovery,"Oct 30, 2025",2025,Oct,30,Zhao W|Zhang T|Hua X|Hoang P H|Miraftab M|Saha M|McElderry J P|Sang J|Lee O W|Hartman C|Khandekar A|Sharma S|Colón-Matos F J|Anyaso-Samuel S|Wang D|Jones K|Hutchinson A|Hicks B|Rosenbaum J|Zhong X|Yang Y|Pesatori A C|Consonni D|Christiani D C|Leung K C|Wong M P|Manczuk M|Lissowska J|Świątkowska B|Mukeria A|Shangina O|Zaridze D|Holcatova I|Mates D|Milosavljevic S|Ognjanovic S|Savic M|Kontic M|Gaborieau V|Brennan P|Arrieta O|Bossé Y|Edell E S|Schabath M B|Hofman P|Mas L|Yendamuri S S|Chen C|Chang I|Hsiung C A|Liu G|Martinez Santamaría J|Gould Rothberg B E|Mutreja K|Lawrence S|Rothman N|Alexandrov L B|Leduc C|Baine M K|Joubert P|Sholl L M|Travis W D|Homer R|Lan Q|Chanock S J|Yang L|Yang S|Shi J|Landi M T,Edell E S,"National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.|National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.|National Cancer Institute, United States.|National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Rockville, MD, United States.|National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States.|Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., Rockville, Maryland, United States.|Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Rockville, MD, United States.|Westat (United States), United States.|University of Chicago, United States.|University of Milan, Milan, Italy.|Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.|Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States.|University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|Maria Skłodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland.|Maria Skłodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Poland.|Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Poland.|Russian Cancer Research Center NN Blokhin, Moscow, Russia.|Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.|National Instititute of Public Health, Bucharest, Romania.|International Organization for Cancer Prevention and Research, Serbia and Montenegro.|School of Medicine University of Belgrade Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia, Serbia and Montenegro.|Clinic for Pulmonology, University Clinical Center of Serbia.

41165699,Proton Beam vs Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy in Olfactory Neuroblastoma.,"Adjuvant radiotherapy can improve locoregional control and survival in patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), particularly with advanced-stage and histologic-grade disease. Standard radiotherapy treatment is with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT) provides theoretical advantages in greater sparing of dose to uninvolved organs at risk.To investigate if there are differences in the effectiveness and radiation treatment-related adverse events (RTAEs) between adjuvant IMRT and PBRT for patients with ONB.This propensity score-matched cohort study included patients with ONB treated between February 2005 and April 2021 with either IMRT or PBRT at 9 academic tertiary care centers in North America. Patients were matched 1:2 based on age, modified Kadish stage, and Hyams grade. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to January 2025.Adjuvant IMRT or adjuvant PBRT.Local recurrence-free survival (RFS), any RFS, and overall survival (OS). RTAEs, ie, grade 2 events or higher based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, were recorded for both modalities.Of 54 included patients, 27 (50%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 46.2 (15.4) years. A total of 18 were treated with PBRT and 36 were treated with IMRT. Most patients had modified Kadish stage C disease (33 of 54 [61%]), and 24 patients (44%) had Hyams grade III or IV disease. The RTAE rate was 20% (8 of 40); IMRT had a rate of 21% (6 of 29), and PBRT had a rate of 18% (2 of 11). The difference in the point estimates for 10-year RFS showed a potential clinical benefit favoring IMRT, although the wide confidence interval indicates uncertainty (10-year RFS: IMRT, 63.3%; 95% CI, 44.6-89.8; PBRT, 37.8%; 95% CI, 14.2-100; difference, 25.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.6 to 68.6). There were no clinically meaningful differences in 10-year local RFS (IMRT, 75.6%; 95% CI, 59.8-95.4; PBRT, 72.7%; 95% CI, 45.2-100; difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -35.9 to 41.7) or 10-year OS (IMRT, 61.8%; 95% CI, 42.8-89.1; PBRT, 57.1%; 95% CI, 24.3-100; difference, 4.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -49.2 to 58.6), although wide confidence intervals indicate considerable uncertainty.Due to the imprecision of estimates, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding the comparative effectiveness of IMRT vs PBRT for patients with ONB.

In the wake of the growing applications of next-generation sequencing technologies including exome and genome sequencing, opportunities for achieving definitive genetic diagnosis are increasingly arising. We present a 46-year-old man with joint laxity, recurrent joint subluxations, pelvic floor dysfunction, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), who was referred for EDS assessment. His medical history included morbid obesity requiring gastric bypass surgery, hearing loss, asthma, retinopathy, myopia, atrial septal defect, narcolepsy with cataplexy, polyneuropathy, folliculitis, lichen simplex chronicus, atopic dermatitis, and hypogonadism. His family history was significant for multiple first- and second-degree relatives who died from cardiac diseases including cases of childhood deaths. Physical examination showed joint laxity with Beighton score of 3/9, bilateral pes planus, hearing loss and macrocephaly. Exome sequencing revealed heterozygous variants LMNA c.1262 T > C p.L421P [classified as likely pathogenic], FLG c.2282_2285del p. S761Cfs*36 [classified as pathogenic], and FLG c.1501 C > T p. R501* [classified as pathogenic]. Mitochondria sequencing revealed a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), MT-ND2 m.5047 T > C p.V193A that is present at 9% heteroplasmy in blood. These findings show co-occurrence of pathogenic sequence variants in neighboring genes located in chromosome 1q2 region [LMNA and FLG] in a patient with features of hereditary connective tissue disorders.

40107864,Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential: a review of its cardiorenal implications and aging.,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a non-malignant state characterized by hematopoietic stem cells exhibiting clonality driven by acquired mutations during aging. Using next-generation sequencing, it has been reported that the prevalence of CHIP increases exponentially with age. Thus far, epigenetic mutations including DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 are the most common mutations identified in driving CHIP. CHIP is considered a pre-malignant state, however with reports of its associations with non-malignant disease states, the clinical impact of CHIP has been of great interest, in particular its effect on the renal and cardiac systems. CHIP has been associated with a higher rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and increased risk of acute kidney injury. CHIP and its driver mutations have also been shown to increase cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis through various inflammatory pathways. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of CHIP through aging, its impact on kidney disease and implications on cardiovascular health. We also compare CHIP to another pre-malignant clonal disorder, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).© The Author(s) 2025.
