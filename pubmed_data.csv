41237355,Natural History of Children and Adolescents With Dravet Syndrome: A 24-Month Follow-Up.,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is an intractable developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused primarily by pathogenic variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene. Patients with DS experience refractory seizures and significant cognitive and behavioral deficits. Longitudinal studies using standardized assessments are needed to systematically document patient outcomes over time. The BUTTERFLY study aimed to assess changes in adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over 24 months in patients with DS.BUTTERFLY was a US-based multicenter, longitudinal observational study involving patients with genetically confirmed DS who were receiving standard-of-care treatment. Patients aged 2-18 years with a confirmed DS diagnosis were included. Exclusion criteria included gain-of-function SCN1A variants, current sodium channel blocker treatment, or other disorders per investigator discretion. The primary outcome measures-adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment-were assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Third Edition (Vineland-3); Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III); and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months across 15 sites. Mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze disease progression, and comparisons were made with published standardized scores for population norms.Of the 36 patients enrolled, 21 completed the study. At baseline, the mean (SD) patient age was 10.8 (5.2) years, and 61.1% were female. Disease progression modeling indicated no significant improvements in 4 of the 6 Vineland-3 subdomains analyzed over 24 months. Receptive Communication (+7.24; 95% CI 1.30-13.19; p = 0.02) and Coping Skills (+4.61; 95% CI 1.14-8.08; p = 0.01) subdomains showed significant improvements. However, for Receptive Communication, this improvement translated to a magnitude of only approximately 3 months in developmental progression over the 24-month period. BSID-III and WPPSI-IV subtests did not show any significant improvement.Despite a relatively small sample size and high withdrawal rate, BUTTERFLY data reveal a widening developmental gap between patients with DS and children with typical development over 24 months. These findings reinforce the critical need for disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying genetic cause of DS to improve long-term outcomes.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Sullivan J|Wirrell E C|Knupp K G|Ciliberto M|Ziobro J|Chen D Y|Flamini J R|Zafar M|LaVallee N|Stepanians M|Ventola P|Chavan T S|Wang F|Parkerson K A|Ticho B,Wirrell E C,"University of California, San Francisco.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.|University of Iowa, Iowa City.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|University of California, San Diego.|Current affiliation: Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|PANDA Neurology, Atlanta, GA.|Duke University, Durham, NC.|PROMETRIKA LLC, Cambridge, MA.|Cogstate Ltd., New Haven, CT.|Porterhouse Medical US, Holmdel, NJ; and.","Sullivan J, Wirrell E C, Knupp K G, Ciliberto M, Ziobro J, Chen D Y, Flamini J R, Zafar M, LaVallee N, Stepanians M, Ventola P, Chavan T S, Wang F, Parkerson K A, Ticho B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237355/,"The study found that children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy, showed little to no improvement in their adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over a 24-month period, despite receiving standard treatment.

40516619,Downregulated mitochondria-encoded long non-coding RNAs in mood disorders.,"Mitochondrial genome-encoded long non-coding RNAs (mt-LncRNAs) that play roles in regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, both crucial in mood disorder pathogenesis, yet remain poorly explored despite growing interest. This study examines their expression levels in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), siblings of individuals with BD (SIB), and healthy controls (HC).Blood samples from 153 participants (31 MDD, 40 BD, 39 SIB, 43 HC) were analyzed for 10 mt-LncRNAs via RT-qPCR. Samples from a subgroup of 15 remitted MDD (MDDREM) patients following 8-week treatment were included for exploratory analysis. A composite score for all LncRNAs, global factor, was derived using principal component analysis. All comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, BMI, and multiple comparisons.Global scores showed overall downregulation in MDD, BD, and SIB compared to HCs, with BD exhibiting the lowest levels (p < 0.01). All mt-LncRNAs were downregulated in BD and SIB, while 8 (excluding ASncmtRNA-2 and 7S RNA) were downregulated in MDD (p < 0.05). Mt-LncRNA levels were lower in BD than in SIB and MDD (p < 0.05), with 6 also lower in SIB compared to MDD (p < 0.05). Exploratory analysis revealed a significant increase in 8 mt-LncRNAs (excluding LIPCAR and 7S RNA) in MDDREM compared to baseline MDD (p < 0.05).Findings show a significant mt-LncRNA downregulation in mood disorders and suggest genetic transmission as well as a capacity to change with treatment. Further research is needed to explore the genetics and modifiability of mt-LncRNAs in mood disorders.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

40752653,"Long-Term Results of NRG/RTOG 9601, a Randomized Trial of Radiation With or Without Antiandrogens in Patients Receiving Salvage Prostate Bed Radiation Therapy Postprostatectomy.","Salvage radiation therapy (RT) is used in men with prostate cancer (PC) recurrence following radical prostatectomy signaled by a persistent or delayed elevation in prostate specific antigen. It was previously reported that the use of antiandrogen therapy (AAT) with RT improved cancer control and overall survival (OS). Long-term follow-up results are presented in this study.From 1998 to 2003, 760 eligible postradical prostatectomy patients with stage pT3N0 or with pT2N0 and positive margins and prostate specific antigen from 0.2 to 4.0 ng/mL were randomly assigned on a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of RT + placebo versus RT + AAT (24 months of bicalutamide, 150 mg daily) during and after RT (64.8 Gy in 36 fractions prostate bed). The primary endpoint was OS estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Time to PC death and metastatic PC (competing risk of death without an event) was estimated using cumulative incidence. The hazard ratio (HR) was obtained using Cox models (OS) and subdistribution HRs (sHRs) used the Fine-Gray model (time to PC death and metastatic PC).Median follow-up for surviving patients was 18.9 years. OS at 18 years was 53% (95% CI, 47%-58%) for RT + AAT and 43% (95% CI, 38%-49%) for RT + placebo (adjusted HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00; 1-sided P = .025). The 18-year incidence of centrally reviewed PC deaths was 18% (95% CI, 14%-22%) RT + AAT and 28% (95% CI, 23-33%) RT + placebo (unadjusted sHR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.84; 2-sided P = .002). The 18-year incidence of metastatic PC was 22% (95% CI, 18-26%) and 31% (95% CI, 26-36%) for AAT and placebo arms, respectively (unadjusted sHR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83; 2-sided P = .001).Long-term results of 24-month duration AAT during and after salvage RT are consistent with the primary report with significantly improved long-term OS, reduced incidence of metastatic PC, and PC death for RT + AAT. In comparison with previous reports, the improvement in OS with AAT has risen from 5% at 12 years to 9.8% at 18 years.Copyright © 2025.

40389098,"Hypofractionated Preoperative Radiation Therapy for Extremity and Superficial Trunk Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Results of a Prospective, Phase 2 Trial.","Preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for resectable extremity soft tissue sarcomas has historically been delivered over 5 weeks and associated with a 35% major wound complication (WC) rate. We investigated the rate of WC in a cohort of soft tissue sarcoma patients treated with a moderately hypofractionated course of preoperative RT.MC1973 was a single-arm, prospective, phase 2, noninferiority trial completed at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Arizona. We administered preoperative RT to 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions. Patients underwent standard of care tumor resection afterward. The primary endpoint was a major WC occurring within 120 days of surgery. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, Fisher Exact tests, and Conchran-Armitage Trend tests were used to evaluate associations with WC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to report early survival-associated outcomes.Between November 24, 2020 and January 30, 2024, 120 patients enrolled on trial. One patient withdrew before receiving treatment. Most common tumor location was proximal lower extremity (48.7%). After RT, 117 patients (97.5%) underwent tumor resection. Two patients treated with RT came off study before surgery because of death. A major WC developed in 27 of 117 patients (23.1%). Median time to WC resolution was 17.4 weeks. The rate of persistent WC at 6 months was 26%. On univariate analysis, leiomyosarcoma histology (n = 5) correlated with a higher WC rate (60%). Median follow-up was 21.1 months. Fourteen patients experienced acute grade 3 adverse events. One year disease-free survival was 86.0% (95% CI, 79.7%-92.9%). Two patients developed local recurrence. One fracture was observed.The major WC rate was 23.1% with a preoperative regimen of 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions. This suggests moderate hypofractionation is not inferior compared with historical standards of major WC rate. Additional follow-up will allow evaluation of oncologic outcomes, long-term treatment-associated adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

41101875,The Role of Radiation Therapy in the Management of Gray Zone Lymphoma.,"Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) is a rare disease that currently has poor treatment outcomes. The role of radiation therapy (RT) in the management of GZL is not well established. This trial is the largest study to report on the outcomes of patients with GZL treated with and without RT.A retrospective review of 30 patients with GZL treated across 3 institutions from 2009 to 2021 was performed. Treatment response was assessed using end-of-treatment (EST) and/or interim (1) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography or computed tomography scans, per Lugano criteria. A complete response (CR) on an interim PET scan (Deauville score, 1-3) was a rapid-early-response, whereas a partial response (PR) on an interim PET scan without progression was a slow-early-response (SER). For EST assessment, a Deauville score of 1 to 3 was considered CR, and a score of 4 to 5 without progression was considered PR. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined from initiation of frontline chemotherapy to disease progression/relapse, initiation of salvage therapy, or death.At a median follow-up of 4 years, the 2-year EFS was 26% for all patients, 33% for RT, and 23% for no-RT (P = .44). The 2-year EFS based on EST was 46% and 10% for CR and PR, respectively (P = .004). Patients with PR to chemotherapy who received RT had significantly better 2-year EFS compared with those who did not (17% vs 0%, P = .007). Among patients with SER, RT was also associated with improved 2-year EFS (33% vs 13%, P = .038). Patients with bulky mediastinal disease had a 2-year EFS of 43% with RT versus 11% without RT (P = .08).Patients with GZL have a high risk of relapse, and RT improves EFS, particularly for patients with SER, PR, and bulky mediastinal disease.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

41236405,Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in the young (aged 50 years and younger): Divergent clinical and molecular characteristics from the elderly.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is largely a disease of individuals older than 50 years; its occurrence in patients aged 50 years and younger is rare. The authors sought to characterize the clinicopathologic features and genetic profile of young-onset (age 50 years and younger) CMML (y-CMML) compared with older onset (older than 50 years) CMML (o-CMML).The authors conducted a multi-institutional study of 32 patients with y-CMML and 119 patients with o-CMML, analyzing clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular data.Patients who had y-CMML frequently presented with splenomegaly (59% vs. 11%; p < .001) and hepatomegaly (25% vs. 2%; p < .001) compared with those who had o-CMML. Although the overall incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities was similar, patients who had y-CMML exhibited distinct mutational patterns. PTPN11 mutations were significantly more common in y-CMML (13% vs. 3%; p = .034) than in o-CMML, whereas TET2 (6% vs. 57%; p < .001) and SRSF2 (16% vs. 46%; p = .002) mutations were significantly less frequent. In addition, multi-hit TET2 (6% vs. 34%; p = .002) and TET2-SRSF2 (3% vs. 29%; p = .003) co-mutations were rare in y-CMML. However, the molecular differences did not affect the CMML-specific risk-stratification categories because the clinical outcomes, including overall survival and leukemia-free survival, did not differ between the two groups.CMML in patients aged 50 years and younger is rare and presents with unique clinical and mutational features, suggesting a distinct pathogenesis.© 2025 The Author(s).

For most patients with mild symptoms, lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and/or pharmacotherapy suffice. Some patients require tests to rule out serious diseases; assess anorectal functions, which are discussed in detail; and to identify structural abnormalities, such as rectoceles, which are occasionally clinically significant. Treatments are applied stepwise, starting with conservative therapy with simpler treatments when feasible (eg, rubber band ligation for grade I-II hemorrhoids), with surgery, usually excisional hemorrhoidectomy, being reserved for more severe disease; for anal fissures, topical therapy using a calcium channel antagonist or nitroglycerine, followed by botulinum toxin and, less frequently, lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic fissures. Anorectal biofeedback therapy is effective for managing DD and, together with bowel modifiers tailored to the specific symptoms (ie, constipation and/or diarrhea), is also used for FI. Biofeedback therapy is not widely accessible, and many patients are treated by pelvic floor physical therapists. For FI, minimally invasive options include sacral neuromodulation and anal dextranomer injection, with colostomy or anal sphincteroplasty now rarely required. Surgical interventions must balance long-term effectiveness with potential risks. Key topics for future research are proposed.Copyright © 2025 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40360931,Increasing Fluconazole Resistance in Candida parapsilosis: A 10-Year Analysis of Blood Culture Isolates at a US Reference Laboratory (2015-2024).,"Antifungal susceptibility testing among 1740 Candida parapsilosis blood isolates submitted to a United States reference laboratory (2015-2024) revealed a significant increase in fluconazole resistance from 8.2% to 20.3% (odds ratio [OR] per year, 1.13 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.06-1.20]; P < .001), with notable acceleration since 2021. Voriconazole resistance remained stable over this period. Micafungin resistance was rare, but intermediate susceptibility significantly increased, especially after 2021 (OR per year, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.25-1.63]; P < .001). These findings highlight important recent shifts in antifungal susceptibility among C parapsilosis isolates, emphasizing the need for ongoing surveillance and stewardship.© The Author(s) 2025.

40751372,Comparability of Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Bile Acid Profiles in Patients With First or Multiply Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection.,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) treatment guidelines suggest varied approaches for patients with first (frCDI) or multiply recurrent CDI (mrCDI). Low microbial diversity, elevated primary bile acids (BA), and low secondary BA concentrations favor germination of C. difficile spores into toxin-producing bacteria and are believed to increase rCDI risk. Greater understanding of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in rCDI may inform management of the disease. We describe a post hoc comparison of GI microbiome and bile acid profiles between patients with frCDI and mrCDI in a Phase 3 open-label trial, ECOSPOR IV, of fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST®; VOS, formerly SER-109), an orally-administered live microbiome therapeutic.Patients received VOS following symptom resolution after standard-of-care antibiotics. Pretreatment baseline (within 3 days following antibiotic completion) and Week 1 post-dosing stool samples were collected for whole metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. Diversity was calculated from MetaPhlAn2 species profiles. Concentrations of primary and secondary BAs were measured via targeted LC-MS/MS.rCDI rates through Week 8 were similarly low in both frCDI and mrCDI patients (6.5% versus 9.7%, respectively). Baseline microbial diversity was similarly low between frCDI and mrCDI subgroups (P > .05). Diversity and secondary BA concentrations increased in both subgroups, whereas primary BA concentrations declined following VOS dosing, leading to few differences between subgroups at Week 1.These data suggest commonalities in microbiome disruption in patients with frCDI and mrCDI that contribute to recurrence and suggest that antibiotics followed by a live microbiome therapy may be an optimal treatment strategy for rCDI, regardless of number of prior CDI recurrences.© The Author(s) 2025.

41233944,Comparative Estimation of Long-Term Graft Patency Rates After Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"We sought to characterize the long-term patency of various graft types in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A comprehensive literature search identified 139 studies including 56,827 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The mean patient age was 62 years (95% confidence interval: 60-63), and 80% (95% confidence interval: 79-82) were male. Patency outcomes were analyzed for each graft type, and parametric extrapolation was performed based on mean patency and mean follow-up time per conduit. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) demonstrated the highest mean patency at 96% with a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, followed by the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) at 94% (2.8 years), gastroepiploic artery (GEA) at 93% (1.7 years), and radial artery (RA) at 89% (3.7 years). The saphenous vein graft had the lowest mean patency at 82% with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Extrapolated 20-year patency rates were 77% for LIMA, 64% for RIMA, 54% for RA, 42% for GEA, and 33% for saphenous vein graft. Arterial grafts demonstrated superior long-term patency compared to vein grafts. LIMA remains the primary conduit of choice, while RIMA, followed by RA and GEA, may be appropriate secondary arterial conduits depending on patient-specific factors.

41233991,Clinical and Pathological Features of CSF1R-Related Disorder Associated with the p.R777Q Pathogenic Variant.,"Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R)-related disorder (CSF1R-RD) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease with a median onset of 43 years. More than 200 CSF1R pathogenic variants have been identified. Patients develop rapidly progressive dementia and motor symptoms with median disease duration of 6.8 years. The p.R777Q variant causes CSF1R-RD; it is deleterious to protein function. We describe clinical and pathological features of CSF1R-RD associated with p.R777Q and report a new family carrying this variant. We compare index case (short duration) with the long-duration CSF1R-RD case.We present clinical and imaging on a new family with p.R777Q. We also describe neuropathology of the index patient and contrast these findings with features of a patient with CSF1R-RD with an 11-year disease course caused by c.2656_2657insC variant.We reviewed the literature of 13 individuals from 8 families with the p.R777Q variant from Asia, Europe, and North America. The mean onset was 41 ± 14 years ranging from 22 to 63 years, and the mean survival was 3.3 ± 2.5 years. Neuropathologic studies of our index patient (10-month disease duration) showed features consistent with CSF1R-RD. Axonal and myelin pathology was severe in the periventricular white matter. Compared to a patient with an 11-year disease duration, white matter had less severity.The p.R777Q variant has an aggressive course compared to CSF1R-RD associated with other variants. Index case had milder neuropathological findings compared to case with long disease duration.

41234158,Reconstruction of the Medial Ulnar Collateral Ligament Using an Anatomic Technique With Suture Tape Augmentation to Allow for Expedited Return to Play in Throwing Athletes.,"Injury to the medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is a common setback for throwing athletes, often requiring reconstruction with 12 to 18 months of rehabilitation. The authors previously described a more anatomic technique with improved mechanical strength as compared with the docking technique, which may allow for an accelerated return to sport.To evaluate return-to-sport rates, time to return to sport, and the effect on the functional performance of amateur and professional throwing athletes who underwent anatomic MUCL reconstruction with suture tape augmentation.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.A retrospective case series was performed including baseball players who underwent anatomic MUCL reconstruction with suture tape augmentation by a single surgeon from 2018 to 2022. Inclusion criteria consisted of a minimum 2-year follow-up, participation in baseball, and utilization of autograft (palmaris longus or gracilis). Patients who underwent previous MUCL reconstruction were excluded from the study. All patients initially followed an accelerated rehabilitation protocol. Outcome measures were collected, including Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic (KJOC), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and Conway-Jobe scores, as well as throwing metrics such as ball velocity and spin rate.Thirty-four baseball players (mean ± SD age, 21 ± 3 years) underwent primary MUCL reconstruction. Time of final follow-up was 36.1 ± 10.3 months. Of these, 16 were professional athletes and 18 were amateur. All throwers returned to live gameplay at a mean 10.1 ± 2.0 months after reconstruction (professional, 10.6 ± 2.3; amateur, 9.7 ± 1.8). Furthermore, 97% (94% professional, 100% amateur) advanced through the accelerated postoperative protocol without issues, and 91% (88% professional, 94% amateur) returned to the same role and 85% (75% professional, 94% amateur) to the same level of play. Professional postinjury KJOC scores improved from 42.6 ± 16 to 87.5 ± 8.3 and SANE scores from 25.0 ± 11.2 to 95.6 ± 4.2. Amateur postinjury KJOC scores improved from 35.6 ± 10.7 to 90.9 ± 8.6 and SANE scores from 57.5 ± 16.9 to 95.2 ± 7.2. No significant difference was identified in preinjury versus postreconstruction throwing velocity, ball spin rate, or horizontal/vertical ball movement. The overall failure rate was 2.9%, with 1 professional pitcher requiring revision for graft rupture at 3 years postoperatively.Anatomic reconstruction of the MUCL with suture tape is a viable option for MUCL injuries, allowing an expedited return to sport at 10.1 ± 2.0 months (professional, 10.6 ± 2.3; amateur, 9.7 ± 1.8) in baseball players, with a low failure rate.",The American journal of sports medicine,"Nov 14, 2025",2025,Nov,14,Camp C L|Jurgensmeier K|Boos A M|Clark S C|Hintz C|Kang L S|Dines J S,Camp C L|Jurgensmeier K|Boos A M|Clark S C|Hintz C|Kang L S|Dines J S,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York, USA.","Camp C L, Jurgensmeier K, Boos A M, Clark S C, Hintz C, Kang L S, Dines J S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41234158/,"The study found that an anatomic reconstruction of the medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) with suture tape augmentation allowed baseball players, both professional and amateur, to return to play in about 10 months on average, with a low failure rate.

41235954,Impact of RAS/BRAF V600E mutations on the tumor immune microenvironment in mismatch repair deficient /microsatellite instability colorectal cancers.,"Routine testing for dMMR/MSI in colorectal cancers (CRCs) is recommended for Lynch Syndrome screening, prognosis, and treatment guidance. In the metastatic setting, RASBRAF mutations guide treatment decisions. The impact of these mutations on tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) in MSI/dMMR CRC are not known.Retrospective analysis of 448 patients with stage I-IV MSI/dMMR CRC profiled using next-generation sequencing (NGS) (Tempus xT DNA-seq of 595-648 genes at 500x coverage and Tempus xR whole-exome capture RNA-seq). MSI status was determined by assessing 44 or 239 loci using NGS. dMMR was determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor neoantigen burden (NTB), PD-L1, immune infiltration, and canonical immune pathways (76 gene set signatures) were analyzed.The median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range 21-86), 59% female, and 70% stage III-IV. Among the 448, 100 (22%) harbored RAS mutations (RASmut), 119 (27%) a BRAFV600E mutation, and 229 (51%) were double wild-type (RASwt, BRAFwt). RASmut exhibited lower NTB (median 12 vs. 15 vs. 16, p=0.003) and PD-L1 (3.6% vs. 13% vs. 24%, p<0.001) than BRAFV600E and wild-type tumors, respectively. The RASmut TiME had lower overall inflammation and fewer infiltrating CD8+ T-cells than wild-type or BRAFV600E tumors. In contrast, BRAFV600E tumors exhibited hyperproliferative characteristics associated with broad metabolic reprogramming but similarly inflamed TiME compared to wild-type tumors.Our data suggest that MSI/dMMR CRCs harboring RASmut are less immunogenic and TiME contains a lower inflammatory profile than wild-type or BRAFV600E tumors.

41236436,"Hepatocellular adenomas with high-risk molecular alterations undetected by ""high-risk"" β-catenin and/or glutamine synthetase staining patterns.","β-Catenin-mutated hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) carry an increased malignant transformation risk and are screened by interpreting glutamine synthetase (GS) and β-catenin by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our study aims to assess GS and β-catenin interpretation guidelines for applicability and reproducibility in predicting high-risk HCA and other relevant molecular alterations.Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), β-catenin, GS, and CD34 stains from 75 HCAs were interpreted by three pathologists using Method A (GS interpretation: negative, perivenular patchy, map-like, diffuse, and indeterminate) and Method B criteria (similar GS interpretation scheme based on a recent publication, with and without CD34 expression patterns). Ease of application and interpretation confidence level were assessed. High-risk IHC was defined as nuclear β-catenin and/or diffuse homogeneous GS. Molecular testing was performed on a subset of HCAs and controls.There were 57 resections and 18 biopsy specimens examined. Methods A and B (GS only) were rated as easy to apply, with high interpretation confidence (≥90% using both methods). Consensus rate was comparable in biopsy specimens (100% for both methods) and resections (88% for Method A, 93% for Method B). While the same cases were stratified into high-risk GS categories using both systems, clinically significant genetic alterations (TERT promoter, EGFR, MTOR, and TP53) were identified in 25% of cases stratified as not high risk by IHC.Both methods have a similar ease of application and level of interpretation confidence, and they also detected β-catenin mutations as expected. Other relevant molecular alterations associated with risk of neoplastic progression and/or bleeding were detected in 25% of HCAs with the non-high-risk IHC phenotype, suggesting the value of molecular testing in this subset.© The Author(s) 2025.

41237393,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in schwannomatosis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), whose occurrence in schwannomatosis remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize MPNSTs in NF type 2 (NF2)- and SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis through a systematic review and meta-analysis of survival outcomes.A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), and Web of Science databases was conducted from database inception through January 2024. Clinical, radiological, histopathological, and treatment data were extracted. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Predictors of outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models.A total of 39 cases were identified. NF2-related disease accounted for 67% of cases, while 28% were SMARCB1 related. The mean age at MPNST diagnosis was 33 years (range 9-79 years). Pain (41%) and weakness (26%) were the most common presenting symptoms. The mortality rate was 72.9%. No tumors were associated with LZTR1 mutations. Tumor locations varied widely, with involvement of the pelvis, thigh, skull base, forearm/hand, and cranial nerves. Trends suggested improved survival in the absence of S100 loss, gross-total resection, and a known schwannoma precursor. Conversely, having an intracranial or intraspinal lesion or having NF2 in the setting of prior radiation therapy were found to be associated with decreased survival and increased progression. A risk stratification tool predicted OS (HR 28.0, p < 0.0001) and PFS (HR 12.1, p < 0.0001).MPNSTs, although rare in schwannomatosis, can arise even in the absence of prior radiation exposure and may mimic benign schwannomas. A preliminary risk stratification tool may aid in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing treatment approaches, although validation is needed. Given the aggressive nature of MPNSTs and their potential for delayed diagnosis due to their rarity, vigilant monitoring and individualized treatment strategies are crucial. Future research should focus on refining risk prediction models and exploring targeted therapies for schwannomatosis-associated MPNSTs to improve patient outcomes.",Journal of neurosurgery,"Nov 14, 2025",2025,Nov,14,Porche K|Hayford K M|Gui C|Suppiah S|Spinner R J,Porche K|Hayford K M|Spinner R J,"1Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and.|2Division of Neurosurgery, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","Porche K, Hayford K M, Gui C, Suppiah S, Spinner R J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237393/,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) can occur in people with schwannomatosis, a rare genetic condition.

41236616,Does skeletal maturity influence vertebral body tethering outcomes? evaluating the role of risser and sanders stages.,"Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a scoliosis correction technique that purportedly leverages spinal growth modulation to correct curves over time. Therefore, measures of skeletal maturity such as Risser and Sanders stages are often used in VBT patient selection. VBT in skeletally mature patients is sometimes seen as controversial or less predictable due to their limited remaining growth. This study compares VBT outcomes in Risser 0-2 vs. 3-5 and Sanders 1-4 vs. 5-8 patients.Single institution retrospective review of 138 post-VBT patients with minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients were grouped by preop Risser and Sanders stages. Independent t-tests (alpha = 0.05) and Fisher's exact test were used for analysis of outcomes.No significant differences were observed in BMI, number of levels instrumented, preop major curve magnitude, preop major curve flexibility, estimated blood loss (EBL), % correction at first erect (FE), % correction at 2-year follow-up, or reoperation rates, complication rates, or cord breakage rates between the skeletally mature and immature patients. Operative time was shorter in Sanders 5-8 patients compared to Sanders 1-4 patients (p = 0.0478). Length of hospital stay was slightly shorter in Risser 3-5 patients (p = 0.0080), with no difference between Sanders groups.At our center, Risser and Sanders stages did not significantly affect most VBT outcomes. Curve correction, reoperation rates, and complication rates were similar, suggesting that VBT can achieve comparable 2-year outcomes across a spectrum of skeletal maturity. However, given the shorter follow-up for the more skeletally mature patients, it remains possible that they may encounter issues such as cord breakage or require reoperation/fusion at rates similar to the less mature patients with longer follow-up.

41236658,Added value and clinical impact of second-opinion subspecialist radiologist interpretations of baseline rectal MRI in patients with rectal cancer.,"To evaluate the completeness and discordance of outside rectal MRI initial staging reports compared to second-opinion reviews, and to assess the potential clinical impact of major discordance on treatment decisions in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.A retrospective analysis of outside rectal MRI reviews submitted for second-opinion interpretation by subspecialized radiologists from June 2014-March 2020 was conducted. Outside and second review reports were compared side-by-side; cases with discordance (and those with major discordance, i.e., may alter treatment, particularly) were identified. Two colorectal surgeons, blinded to report origins, reviewed cases with major discordance to evaluate their theoretical impact on patient management and rated their confidence level of the reports on a five-point Likert scale (1=lowest confidence).In 461 patients (median age, 57 years [IQR: 49-67]; 274 male), compared to outside reviews, second reviews demonstrated improved report completeness across tumor characteristics, local extent, and nodal/metastatic disease clinical staging categories. The largest reporting gaps were in tumor morphology (66.4%, 306/461 vs. 98.7%, 455/461) and extramural venous invasion (29.1%, 134/461 vs. 93.9%, 433/461). Overall, 53.8% (248/461) of cases showed discordance, with 56.5% (140/248) classified as major. In this subset, second reviews led to fewer cases with insufficient information, e.g., 18.6% (26/140) to 7.1% (10/140) for Surgeon 1, and changes in surgical planning in 38.1-46.3% (43/113 to 44/95) of patients. Surgeons rated reports from second reviews with higher confidence scores (median, 4 vs. 2-3, p < 0.001).Second-opinion reviews may impact patient care and improve surgeons' confidence for treatment planning.Question Do subspecialist radiologist second-opinion reviews improve rectal MRI report completeness and affect treatment decisions in rectal adenocarcinoma staging? Findings While outside reviews often under-reported key imaging findings, second reviews improved report completeness, which led to increased confidence by our surgeons in treatment planning. Clinical relevance These findings underscore the value of expert interpretation and highlight the need for optimized MRI protocols and broader adoption of structured reporting in rectal cancer staging.© 2025.

41237389,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in schwannomatosis: a case series.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas predominantly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, their occurrence within NF type 2 (NF2)-related and SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis remains rare and poorly characterized. Accurate and timely diagnosis is challenging due to clinical and radiological similarities with benign schwannomas, potentially delaying appropriate management and impacting outcomes. This study presents an institutional case series aiming to better characterize the clinical presentations specifically for MPNSTs arising in patients with NF2- and SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis.This retrospective case series included patients diagnosed with schwannomatosis who subsequently developed histopathologically confirmed MPNSTs. Conducted at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) and University Health Network (Toronto, Canada), the study spanned January 1, 2003, to November 1, 2024. Patients were selected based on clinical or genetic diagnoses of schwannomatosis using International Consensus Group on Neurofibromatosis Diagnostic Criteria. Comprehensive clinical, radiological, and pathological data, including demographics, presenting symptoms, tumor features (size, location, immunohistochemistry, genetics), treatments (resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), and follow-up outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records.The authors identified 8 patients with a mean age of 36 years, half of whom had NF2-related schwannomatosis. The most common presenting symptom was pain (71%). The mean tumor size was 8.2 ± 7.0 cm, with gross-total resection being the most common surgical treatment (67%), typically supplemented with radiation therapy (78%). More than half of the patients (56%) exhibited metastatic disease, and all tumors with reported grading were Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grade 3. No tumors were associated with LZTR1 mutations. One notable case involved a 39-year-old male with SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis who had a femoral MPNST resected 13 years prior and subsequently developed a sciatic nerve MPNST that was managed successfully with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and negative margin resection. Of note, the second lesion arose from a hybrid neurofibroma/schwannoma. Another case, a 33-year-old male with SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis, had an incidental finding of epithelioid MPNST in a minimally symptomatic small palmar lesion.This case series highlights that MPNSTs, although uncommon, can arise in NF2- and SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis without prior radiation exposure, presenting significant diagnostic challenges due to their similarity to benign schwannomas. The findings underscore the importance of maintaining clinical vigilance and employing individualized management strategies, balancing thorough resection with the preservation of function and patient quality of life.",Journal of neurosurgery,"Nov 14, 2025",2025,Nov,14,Porche K|Hayford K M|Gui C|Suppiah S|Spinner R J,Porche K|Hayford K M|Spinner R J,"1Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and.|2Department of Neurosurgery, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","Porche K, Hayford K M, Gui C, Suppiah S, Spinner R J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237389/,"This study found that malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) can develop in patients with schwannomatosis, a rare genetic condition.

41237417,Ultrasound urodynamic studies (US-UDS): noninvasive estimation of detrusor pressure through ultrasound.,"Urodynamic studies (UDS) are vital for evaluating bladder function but require invasive catheterization to measure detrusor pressure (Pdet). Our purpose is to report on technical developments toward a noninvasive and accurate estimation of Pdet through ultrasound, a technique we refer to as Ultrasound Urodynamic Study (US-UDS). &#xD;Approach: The proposed US-UDS technique produces an estimate of Pdet by using ultrasound to induce and track elastic waves that propagate within and around the bladder wall. Key components of the US-UDS processing include: an ultrasound sequence with dense time sampling; an empirical correction accounting for deviation from a Lamb wave dispersion model; and constrained optimization for Pdet estimation. US-UDS analysis for estimation of Pdet was applied to 533 distinct data points collected from 3 human subjects undergoing concurrent urodynamics study (UDS). Concordance analysis was used to evaluate agreement between US-UDS and UDS measures of Pdet while response operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate US-UDS for detection of detrusor activity (parameterized as UDS Pdet >15 cmH2O).US-UDS was able estimate Pdet within 10 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O of UDS measurements with coverage probabilities of 95.7% and 68.8% respectively. Furthermore, US-UDS was able to detect UDS Pdet measurements greater than 15 cmH2O with a sensitivities and specificities of 0.99 and 0.83 using a fixed threshold (>15 cmH2O for US-UDS) and 1.0 and 0.93 for an optimized threshold (> 11.08 cmH2O for US-UDS).Our results show that the technical developments of US-UDS put forth in this work are able produce accurate and useful estimates of Pdet as compared to traditional UDS. Although additional research with a large number of subjects is needed to fully characterize the clinical utility of US-UDS, the developments and results from this work demonstrate that clinically useful non-invasive measurements of Pdet are feasible from ultrasound measurements.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Physics in medicine and biology,"Nov 14, 2025",2025,Nov,14,Rosen D P|Linder B J|Alizad A|Fatemi M,Rosen D P|Linder B J|Alizad A|Fatemi M,"Physiology and Biomedical Engineerng, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, 200 1st.

41238400,Impact of Spatial Resolution on CT Imaging of Middle Ear Prostheses: Comparison of Photon-Counting and Energy-Integrating Detectors.,"CT imaging of sub-millimeter middle ear prostheses-vital for post-surgery treatment-requires highspatial-resolution. This study evaluated the impact of spatial resolution for the visualization of prostheses using photon-countingdetector (PCD) CT, energy-integrating-detector (EID) CT, and EID-CT with attenuating comb filters.Twenty-one middle ear prostheses of different makes were placed within a head phantom and scanned on a PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens), two dual-source CTs with comb filters (Force and Flash, Siemens), and a dual-layer CT without comb filter (7500, Philips). Scanning and reconstruction followed clinical temporal bone protocols for each scanner, with a matched 120kV and 80mm field-of-view; sharp kernels/algorithms of Qr89, Ur77, Ur77, and YD; and minimal allowable slice thickness of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.67mm, respectively. Qualitative assessments were performed, including visual inspection, volume rendering, a blind reader study, and quantitative assessments using line profiles, and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). One prosthesis was implanted in human cadaver head and scanned on a PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens), a 3rd generation dual-source (Force, Siemens), and a dual-layer CT (7500, Philips) following the same phantom study protocols. Image quality was compared among the scanners.PCD-CT provided images with the highest spatial resolution, allowing clinically relevant assessment of prosthesis position. EID-CT scanners with comb filters provided good results, with noticeable loss of detail, while EID-CT without a comb filter showed substantial resolution loss. These findings were consistent across readers (Kendall's W=0.89, p-value<0.001) and validated by the line profiles and FWHM measurements. PCD-CT showed a 49.5% improvement over EID-CT without comb filter. Among scanners with ultra-high-resolution (UHR) capabilities, PCD-CT had lower radiation dose (CTDIvol: 31.5 vs 46.7 and 51.4 mGy) and lower noise (81.3 vs 93.0 and 274.8 HU) compared to two EID-CTs with comb filters. In the cadaver study, PCD-CT provided higher resolution and lower noise than both EID-CT scanners with and without comb filters (67.6 vs 118.6 and 50.1 HU).PCD-CT provided dose-efficient, accurate evaluation of ossicular prostheses, without the degradation of sub-millimeter structures, while maintaining lower dose and noise.PCD＝ Photon-counting-detector; EID＝ Energy-integrating-detector; UHR＝ Ultra-high-resolution; FWHM＝ Full-width at half-maximum; FOV＝ Field-of-view; VRT＝ Volume rendering technique; CTDIvol＝ Volume CT dose index; PROP＝ Partial ossicular replacement prosthesis; TROP＝ Total ossicular replacement prosthesis.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41239170,Healthcare Resource Utilization in Refractory MACLD: Comparison of an Amikacin Liposome Inhalation Suspension (ALIS) Cohort with a Non-ALIS Cohort.,"Add-on treatment with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) to a multidrug antibiotic regimen is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for adults with refractory Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). In real-world settings, other antibiotics may be added on to treat refractory MACLD. We analyzed healthcare resource utilization in a US patient population who received add-on treatment for refractory MACLD.This was a retrospective claims analysis using Merative™ MarketScan® databases (January 2016 to December 2022). Two patient cohorts were defined: an ALIS and non-ALIS cohort. Index date was date of first prescription with ALIS or non-ALIS antibiotic for refractory MACLD. Hospitalizations (all-cause, respiratory-related, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-related) and emergency room (ER) visits at 0-6-month and 7-12-month post-index periods were compared with baseline (6-month pre-index period) per cohort. Multivariate logistic regression models compared the odds of hospitalizations or ER visits between cohorts.The ALIS and non-ALIS cohorts comprised 116 and 63 patients, respectively. The most common add-on treatments for refractory MACLD in the non-ALIS cohort were parenteral amikacin (41.3%) and moxifloxacin (27.0%). In the ALIS cohort, significant reductions from baseline, as compared with the 7-12-month post-index period, were observed in all-cause (12.1% vs 22.4%), respiratory-related (8.6% vs 20.7%), and NTM-related hospitalizations (9.5% vs 19.8%) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). There were no significant changes from baseline in hospitalizations at follow-up in the non-ALIS cohort. No significant changes from baseline in ER visits or hospital length of stay were observed in either cohort. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of all-cause (OR [95% confidence interval, CI] 0.45 [0.21-0.96]) and respiratory-related hospitalizations (OR 0.44 [0.21-0.96]) were statistically significantly lower in the ALIS cohort compared with the non-ALIS cohort.Add-on treatment with ALIS in refractory MACLD may lead to reductions in hospitalizations over time and lower odds of hospitalizations compared with add-on treatment with non-ALIS antibiotics.© 2025.

41239509,Molecular insights into prognostic model for meningiomas treated with stereotactic radiosurgery: negative impacts of 1q gain on tumor control and survival.,"Molecular classifications enhance prognostic accuracy in meningiomas; however, their predictive significance following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains unclear. This study aimed to assess whether molecular characteristics identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES), specifically driver mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs), are prognostic indicators of outcomes after SRS. This retrospective cohort study included 95 patients (median age 61; 66% female) with 97 surgically resected meningiomas treated with SRS between 1999 and 2023. Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Tumors were molecularly classified using WES into Group A (NF2-wildtype), Group B (NF2 mutation/22q loss without high-risk CNAs), and Group C (high-risk CNAs including 1p loss, 1q gain, 6p/6q loss, 10p/10q loss, 14q loss, 18p/18q loss, and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion). Group C exhibited significantly inferior PFS at 5 years (49.7%) compared with Groups A (88.5%, p < 0.001) and B (100%, p = 0.002). DSS at 10 years was also significantly reduced in Group C (60.4%) relative to Groups A and B (100%, p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Within Group C, 1q gain correlated strongly with poorer outcomes, with significantly lower 5-year PFS (15.9% vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001) and DSS (51.3% vs. 90.4%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, even WHO grade 1 tumors with 1q gain demonstrated significantly worse outcomes (5-year PFS: 33.3% vs. 76.5%, p = 0.023; DSS: 44.4% vs. 89.3%, p = 0.011). Molecular classification utilizing WES-derived CNAs substantially improves prognostic prediction after SRS for meningiomas. Chromosome 1q gain was a critical biomarker indicating elevated risk for tumor progression and mortality, even among WHO grade 1 tumors.© 2025.

39586969,Combined One-Step Hybrid Treatment for a Pediatric Giant Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm: A Case Report.,"Giant intracranial aneurysms require complex treatment strategies including clipping, coiling, stenting, parent artery occlusion, bypass, or combined procedures. Neurovascular hybrid operating rooms (h-OR) combine a conventional operating theatre with high-resolution digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We describe a one-step combined surgical and endovascular treatment in a h-OR for a pediatric internal carotid artery (ICA) giant aneurysm that can be an optimal solution to manage such challenging cases.An 11-year-old boy presented with rapid onset right hemiparesis and left eyelid ptosis. A 3-month history of headache associated with sporadic vomit was reported. A giant, unruptured, left ICA aneurysm was detected on imaging. The patient underwent surgical trapping of the aneurysm. Intraoperative DSA showed residual backflow from the posterior communicating artery and coils were placed to completely exclude the aneurysm. At 18-month follow-up, the patient showed a complete recovery and magnetic resonance imaging showed a progressive reduction of the sac aneurysm.Due to their morphological variability, intracranial giant aneurysms may require a different procedural strategy instead of direct clipping or coiling. The introduction of h-OR allows combined treatments to be performed simultaneously in the same room setting. The present case shows that combined treatment in a neurovascular h-OR can be an optimal solution to manage challenging cases, such as giant aneurysms, reducing operative time with the added benefit of selecting an appropriate strategy adjustment in a multidisciplinary effort.Thieme.

41220603,"Retrograde Intramedullary Femoral Lengthening With Acute Deformity Correction in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults.","Acquired and congenital limb length discrepancies often coexist with deformities of the distal femur. Lengthening of the femur along its anatomic axis changes the limb's mechanical alignment. Angular correction and lengthening can be achieved at the same site if a retrograde lengthening nail is used with a specific preoperative planning method (""reverse planning"") which permits patient-specific selection of the final mechanical axis.A consecutive cohort series of children, adolescents, and young adults (mean 15.6 ± 4.8 years) undergoing retrograde implantable femoral lengthening between the years 2011 and 2024 were analyzed. Surgical details, lengthening parameters, Limb Lengthening and Reconstruction Society (LLRS)-AIM index, accuracy of final correction, and complications were reviewed and classified. Patients were eligible only if the distal femoral physis was closed.Seventy-three lengthening were eligible in the study period. Average lengthening was 4.2 ± 1.4 cm (range 2.0-8.0 cm), and consolidation index was 39.4 ± 21.9 days/cm. Deformities and length discrepancies were moderately complex, with a mean LLRS AIM score of 6 (range 1-13). Complication rates were similar to previous reports of intramedullary femoral lengthening, comparable between congenital (12 of 31, 39%) and acquired etiologies (16 of 42, 38%). Preoperative coronal alignment ranged from 14° varus to 20° valgus, while final coronal alignment was 0.4° ± 3.4° of neutral (range 7° valgus to 13° varus). Coronal deformities up to 20° and sagittal deformities up to 23° were corrected acutely at the lengthening site.Retrograde intramedullary femoral lengthening with acute deformity correction at the same site is an alternative to antegrade lengthening with separate osteotomy of the distal femur in children and adolescents. The reverse planning method allows reproducible length and deformity correction at the same location.
