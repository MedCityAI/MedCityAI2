41151001,Expert Consensus on Genetic Diagnostic Approaches for Patients With Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy.,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is the phenotypic description of a clinically and genetically diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders involving proximal muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdles. There are currently over 30 different genetic forms of LGMD, and despite diagnostic advances, accurate diagnoses may be difficult to achieve. Although clinical diagnosis of a patient with a specific form of LGMD is possible in some cases, a precise and timely genetic diagnosis can be crucial to anticipate and prevent complications associated with particular genetic forms of LGMD (e.g., extramuscular manifestations such as cardiac, respiratory, or cognitive impairments). With the rapid pace of genetic testing advances, updates on training and education are imperative to support the correct use of these tests. We formed an expert consensus to provide an efficient diagnostic approach meant to empower clinicians in the use of genetic and other supportive tests. Informed selection and interpretation of a gene panel; use of genome or exome sequencing; and use of biochemical, imaging, pathology, and electromyography tests are discussed here. Ultimately, genetic testing should help to confirm a diagnosis and guide treatment decisions or counseling services.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Straub V|Clause A R|Donkervoort S|Kang P B|Laverty C G|Niu Z|Wicklund M P|Bönnemann C G|Cooper S T|Díaz-Manera J|Johnson N E|Narayanaswami P|Vissing J|Walter M C|Craige C|Weihl C C,Niu Z,"John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University and Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom.|Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.|Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.|Greg Marzolf Jr. Muscular Dystrophy Center and Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.|Institute for Translational Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.|Department of Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego.|Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|UT Health San Antonio, TX.|Kids Neuroscience Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|Functional Neuromics, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.|Department of Neurology, Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.|Friedrich-Baur-Institute at the Department of Neurology, LMU University Hospital, Munich, Germany; and.|Kay Square Scientific, Butler, PA.","Straub V, Clause A R, Donkervoort S, Kang P B, Laverty C G, Niu Z, Wicklund M P, Bönnemann C G, Cooper S T, Díaz-Manera J, Johnson N E, Narayanaswami P, Vissing J, Walter M C, Craige C, Weihl C C",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41151001/,"The key finding of this research is that there are over 30 different genetic forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), a group of inherited neuromuscular disorders.

41147773,Exploring Factors Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Cognitive impairment is prevalent in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), yet risk factors are not well understood. We explored associations between clinical characteristics and cognitive impairment in an RA cohort.Data were from a longitudinal RA cohort at Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Cognition was evaluated using the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) exam. Demographics and health factors, objectively measured physical function, participant-reported symptoms, RA disease characteristics, and comorbidities were evaluated. Univariable linear regressions explored the association between clinical factors and SLUMS score. Those with p<0.1 in the univariable models were evaluated in separate multivariable linear regressions controlling for age, sex, and years of education.145 participants with RA were included, aged 64.5±11.6 years and were predominantly male (74%). Using the SLUMS, 42 (29%) participants had normal cognition, 83 (57%) had mild cognitive impairment, and 20 (14%) had dementia. Physical performance [aβ:0.35 (0.11 to 0.59)], self-reported exhaustion [aβ:-2.22 (-3.44 to -0.99)], pain [aβ:-0.25 (-0.50 to -0.00)], disability [aβ:-1.79 (-3.16 to -0.42)], and trouble falling asleep [aβ:-2.57 (-4.00 to -1.14)] were all independently associated with a lower SLUMS score (all p<0.05).Cognitive impairment was prevalent in our cohort of Veterans with RA and was associated with several modifiable clinical factors. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the directionality of these associations and evaluate interventions for modifiable risk factors that may mitigate cognitive dysfunction.This article is protected by copyright.

40590852,"Impact of transplant conditioning, NPM1 mutations, and measurable residual disease in FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia.","We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1506 (MORPHO), a randomized trial of gilteritinib vs placebo as posttransplantation maintenance for patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), focusing the interactions between conditioning regimen intensity, measurable residual disease (MRD), and NPM1 comutation status reported from diagnosis. Comparing FLT3-ITD MRD before and after conditioning, there was no difference between myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in eradication or reduction of FLT3-ITD MRD. For participants who were FLT3-ITD MRD negative before HCT, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse during follow-up between those receiving MAC vs RIC. NPM1 comutation was associated with the largest magnitude of relapse-free survival benefit from post-HCT gilteritinib, and in these participants, post-HCT gilteritinib in the setting of RIC appeared to be as effective as MAC at preventing relapse. MAC appeared superior to RIC in preventing relapse only in participants who were NPM1 wild type at diagnosis and FLT3-ITD MRD positive before HCT. Our findings suggest that only a subset of patients with FLT3-ITD AML undergoing HCT may benefit from MAC and that, similar to AML therapy before HCT, the intensity of the HCT regimen should be adapted according to the molecular features of the disease.

41144907,New Clues to the Challenge of Knee Arthrofibrosis: From Molecules to Therapies.,"Knee arthrofibrosis (AF) is a debilitating complication after total knee arthroplasty. AF is characterized by formation of fibrotic adhesions, loss of joint mobility, and pain. With osteoarthritis prevalence and associated total knee arthroplasties projected to rise sharply, AF is becoming increasingly prevalent, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood and no effective treatments exist. Like other fibrotic diseases, knee AF is a multifactorial disease that exhibits TGFβ1-driven myofibroblast transformation and excessive collagen deposition. However, knee AF also displays unique features, including rapid disease development and the establishment of a highly fibrotic mass rather than fibrotic tissue infiltration. Our integrative research approach uses human patient fibroblasts, multiomics profiling, and in vivo animal models to dissect disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Our work suggests altered adipogenic cell differentiation in the knee and epigenetic pathways controlling myofibroblastogenesis to be involved in AF development. Anti-inflammatory interventions with ketotifen and celecoxib reduce knee AF in vivo, indicating a contributory role of inflammation as well. Together, our novel findings elucidate causal and mechanistic drivers of AF and define this disease as an adipose-depleted fibrotic disorder driven by aberrant differentiation and epigenetic regulation, suggesting new therapeutic avenues for intervention.Copyright © 2025 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Oct 28, 2025",2025,Oct,28,Thaler R|Payne A N|Berry D J|Abdel M P,Thaler R,"From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Thaler R, Payne A N, Berry D J, Abdel M P",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144907/,"Knee arthrofibrosis is a debilitating complication after knee replacement surgery, characterized by the formation of scar tissue and loss of joint mobility.

41145405,"Seroprevalence and Incidence of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella in Adult Solid Organ Transplant Recipients in the United States: A Large Database Analysis.","Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is rare. We aim to investigate the pretransplant seroprevalence, MMR infection posttransplant, and whether immediate pretransplant MMR vaccination is associated with MMR infection.We queried the TriNetX database in December 2024 to assess (1) pretransplant MMR seroprevalence, (2) characteristics and outcomes of posttransplant MMR infections, and (3) outcomes for recipients who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant. Only US data were included. MMR infection was identified through International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.Among 313 548 SOT recipients identified in the database (from 2009 to 2024), IgG positivity for MMR was 72%, 80%, and 78% when available (~5% each). Based on ICD codes, posttransplant MMR infections occurred in 107 (0.03%), 124 (0.04%), and 38 (0.01%) recipients, respectively. The 90-d rejection rates were 36%, 27%, and 42%, whereas mortality rates were 7%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, in patients with MMR infection. Among 114 recipients vaccinated within 30 d pretransplant, none developed posttransplant MMR infections.Overall, posttransplant MMR infections in adult SOT recipients were uncommon in this data set, and no vaccine-associated infections were documented among those who received the MMR vaccine within 30 d pretransplant in real-world practice. The primary limitation of this study is that most MMR infections were identified using ICD codes without confirmation through serological testing or polymerase chain reaction, and we were unable to further characterize the infections because the de-identified database lacked information on the patient's ZIP code and transplant hospital.

41147514,The effects of dry needling and therapeutic exercise on sleep in individuals with chronic neck pain and sleep disturbance: a feasibility randomized clinical trial.,"Evidence shows that dry needling (DN) influences biochemical substances linked to pain modulation and sleep regulation. Therefore, DN has the potential to be an effective intervention for sleep disturbance (SD) in patients with chronic neck pain (CNP). The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of combining DN with therapeutic exercise (TE) to improve sleep in individuals with CNP and SD, and (2) explore prelimnary effects of this intervention.Twenty-eight individuals with CNP and SD were randomized to a DN+TE group (n = 14) or TE group (n = 14). The randomized controlled trial (RCT) was deemed feasible if: (1) 4-week attrition rate was < 20%, (2) no significant adverse responses, and (3) ≥ 75% of participants completed follow-up assessments. Outcome measures included sleep duration, sleep quality, pain intensity, and disability level. Sleep duration (via actigraphy) was measured at baseline and weekly for three weeks. Other outcomes-Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Neck Disability Index- were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention.A large-scale RCT was determined to be feasible with an attrition rate of 6.7%, an absence of significant adverse responses, and 93.3% follow-up completion. Both groups demonstrated significant 12-week improvements in pain and disability  , but only the DN+TE groupdemonstrated significant gains in sleep quality, greatest after the 4-week intervention.Conducting a large-scale RCT appears feasible, and preliminary findings suggest that DN may improve sleep quality in individuals with CNP and SD.

41147830,Indomethacin Fails to Increase Intestinal Permeability in Healthy Volunteers.,"Indomethacin is often used experimentally to induce intestinal hyperpermeability, enabling evaluation of interventions targeting barrier function.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT05538247) in healthy volunteers to assess whether a supplement could mitigate indomethacin-induced hyperpermeability. Participants received 150 mg/day of indomethacin for 6 days, either before or during placebo/supplement administration. Permeability was measured using 13C-mannitol and lactulose urinary excretion.Contrary to expectations, indomethacin failed to increase 13C-mannitol excretion in either group. No meaningful elevations in serum (zonulin, claudins) or fecal (calprotectin) biomarkers were observed.Our findings suggest that the expected increase in intestinal permeability following indomethacin administration may not be consistently observed in healthy volunteers.

41148218,"Artificial Intelligence in Critical Care Nephrology: Current Applications, Emerging Techniques, and Challenges to Clinical Integration.","Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI, has the potential to advance critical care nephrology (CCN) by enhancing prediction accuracy, improving diagnostic capabilities, supporting clinical decision-making, and streamlining workflow processes. Current applications in CCN include acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction, nephrotoxin surveillance, intradialytic hypotension forecasting, and AI-guided dialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) management, with performance often exceeding traditional models. However, the effect on patient-centered outcomes such as mortality, dialysis dependence, and cost-effectiveness remains uncertain. Emerging techniques, such as conformal prediction for calibrated risk estimates, causal inference for intervention modeling, and reinforcement learning for adaptive ultrafiltration, show promise in enhancing reliability, interpretability, and individualized care. Generative AI and large language models extend these applications to clinical documentation, reasoning, and patient education, while raising new challenges, including hallucinations, regulatory oversight, and clinician trust. Persistent barriers such as data heterogeneity, limited external validation, alert fatigue, and economic constraints hinder broad adoption. This review synthesizes the current evidence and outlines four priorities for advancing AI in CCN: 1) rigorous multicenter validation focused on clinical outcomes, 2) integration of uncertainty quantification and causal modeling into AI tools, 3) development of clinician-centered interfaces that minimize cognitive load, and 4) establishment of transparent, adaptive regulatory and governance frameworks. Realizing the promise of AI in CCN will require multidisciplinary collaboration, fairness and generalizability testing, and sustainable implementation strategies that align technological innovation with measurable improvements in patient care.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Therefore, investigations of preventive methods are highly welcomed. Our goal was to conduct a systematic review of the literature about the use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema during breast cancer treatment. We hypothesized that identification of arm-draining lymph nodes may decrease the incidence of lymphedema. Methods: On October 7, 2019, we conducted a systematic review of studies in PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Answers, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, without time frame or language limitations, on the use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema during breast cancer treatment. We excluded articles that investigated other uses of lymphoscintigraphy, such as lymphedema diagnosis or treatment evaluation. Results: Of 104 potential articles found in the literature, 5 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A total of 501 patients were included. Reverse mapping was done with radiography or single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Moreover, the examination was applied with different treatments, such as axillary lymph node dissection or radiotherapy, allowing preservation of noncompromised lymph nodes. Axillary reverse mapping also had prognostic value and was used with sentinel lymph node biopsy to identify patients at higher risk for lymphedema. Only one study compared the incidence of lymphedema between patients who received standard care or reverse mapping, showing significant benefits of its use. Conclusions: Use of axillary reverse mapping to prevent lymphedema is feasible and seems to provide valuable information for breast cancer treatment. Future studies that compare reverse mapping and standard care are still necessary.",Lymphatic research and biology,"Oct 28, 2025",2025,Oct,28,Boczar D|Forte A J|Huayllani M T|Kassis S|Manrique O J|McLaughlin S A,Boczar D|Forte A J|Huayllani M T|Manrique O J|McLaughlin S A,"Division of Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Plastic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.|Division of Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.","Boczar D, Forte A J, Huayllani M T, Kassis S, Manrique O J, McLaughlin S A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41151102/,"The key finding of this research is that using axillary reverse mapping during breast cancer treatment can help prevent lymphedema, a common side effect.

41151837,Targeting PD-L1-CMTM6 interactions in myeloid cells triggers PD-L1 degradation and enhances cytotoxic T-cell expansion.,"Immune checkpoint therapies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been met with limited clinical responses in the treatment of patients of varying cancer types. Current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies function to prevent PD-1 binding to PD-L1, thereby preventing T-cell suppression. However, these therapies fail to prevent PD-L1 intrinsic signaling and recycling, which can render these treatments ineffective. Moreover, most research primarily focuses on how these antibodies affect tumor cells and their interactions with T cells. Myeloid cells, which also express PD-L1 and influence T-cell responses, are integral to the efficacy of these therapies. However, strategies that can target these cells to boost antitumor responses have not been effective.Our group has developed a new anti-PD-L1 antibody (H1A), which disrupts PD-L1 recycling and redirects it towards degradation. Due to the loss of available PD-L1 protein, H1A effectively prevents PD-L1 intrinsic signaling. Using in vivo humanized PD-1/PD-L1 mouse tumor models, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of H1A against current FDA-approved PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Using human-derived immune cell in vitro assays, we pinpoint the biological consequences of H1A-induced PD-L1 degradation in myeloid cells.H1A demonstrated improved tumor control and established immunological memory responses in vivo in the treatment of tumors with moderate immunogenicity that are less responsive to current immunotherapies. This was supported by enhanced activation of myeloid cells (major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and CD80) and frequencies of effector T-cell populations found intratumorally. Human myeloid cells treated with H1A were also observed to have increased activation (MHC-II and CD80) and cytokine secretion. Similar to our in vivo findings, human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures demonstrated increased frequencies of effector T-cell populations and greater tumor cell killing.This work highlights the importance of targeting PD-L1 recycling and intrinsic signaling, specifically in myeloid cells, to boost antitumor responses. Our studies suggest that H1A can provide a solution to the lack of responses seen with current therapeutics, while also revealing previously unknown intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in myeloid cells.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41151978,Prioritization of outcome measures in regional anesthesia research.,"Outcome selection in regional anesthesia and acute pain research is inconsistent, often lacking patient-centered priorities and validated instruments. We aimed to prioritize key outcomes and propose suitable measurement tools to improve the quality, consistency, and relevance of regional anesthesia research.We conducted a multiround Delphi process, including two electronic voting rounds, a multiday in-person meeting, and a patient panel. Experts and patients evaluated existing and proposed outcomes for importance, validity, and relevance. Outcomes reaching ≥70% agreement were prioritized, and appropriate measurement instruments were identified.Thirty-two experts and three patients participated. Across three Delphi rounds, 10 outcomes were prioritized for future regional anesthesia research: seven efficacy outcomes (pain scores; opioid consumption; Brief Pain Inventory; functional outcomes; cognitive function; length of stay; block duration); two multidimensional outcomes (quality of recovery and development of a regional anesthesia-specific quality-of-recovery instrument); one safety outcome (chronic postsurgical pain). Patients prioritized cognitive recovery, function, chronic pain, and pain scores.This consensus-based, patient-centered framework defines the core priorities for future regional anesthesia and acute pain research. Future work should focus on developing and validating a regional anesthesia-specific quality-of-recovery instrument, refining multidimensional measures such as functional recovery, cognitive outcomes, and the Brief Pain Inventory, and standardizing the reporting of chronic pain and opioid-related outcomes. Adoption of these priorities will enhance methodological consistency, comparability, and patient relevance in future clinical trials.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2025.

40222034,Assessing the Outcomes of the Initial Virtual Breast Imaging Fellowship Interview Season.,"To assess breast imaging fellowship program directors' perspectives of the outcomes of the first-ever virtual interview season. A 19-question survey was constructed by members of the Fellowship Match Committee of the Society of Breast Imaging and distributed via email to 103 program directors. An initial email with a link to the survey was distributed on May 17, 2023, with 2 reminder emails sent on May 31, 2023, and June 20, 2023. The survey was closed on June 26, 2023. Results were compiled, and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Excel. There were 36 total responses yielding a response rate of 35% (36/103). The majority of programs, 61% (22/36), did not fill positions with any internal candidates. Overall, 72% answered that the perception of their fellow's performance was equal to or higher than those in prior years. Despite the effects of the pandemic on clinical exposure for this cohort, 73% of programs stated that the fellow's foundational knowledge was equivalent or better. Remarkably, 81% of respondents stated that procedural skills were equivalent or better, and 78% stated that communication skills were equivalent or better. This is the first study to investigate the outcomes of the unexpected pivot to virtual interviews. Despite the lack of preparation for this operational shift, it does not appear to have negatively impacted the program directors' impressions of their matched fellows.© Society of Breast Imaging 2025.
