41204111,"Endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms at a single center: Outcomes, selection strategy, and transparent communication for patient decision-making.","BackgroundThe management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) requires a balance between procedural risks and the potential benefit of rupture prevention.ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and anatomical results of endovascular treatment for UIAs at our institution, to benchmark our practice and potential areas for improvement, and enable transparent communication with patients by providing accurate, evidence-based information.MethodsWe reviewed all patients treated for an UIA between January 2017 and July 2022. Patients were grouped according to treatment technique: simple or balloon-assisted coiling; stent-assisted coiling; or flow-diverter stent placement. Clinical outcomes included perioperative mortality, transient (<3 months), and permanent morbidity (>3 months). Anatomical results were graded with the Raymond-Roy or the O'Kelly-Marotta scales. Retreatment rates, length of hospitalization, readmissions, irradiation time, and total radiation dose were assessed.ResultsIn total, 169 patients with 201 UIAs underwent 187 endovascular procedures without death, 1% permanent morbidity, 8% transient morbidity, and 4% retreatment. The treatment subgroups analysis shows an absence of permanent morbidity associated with flow-diverter stenting and stent-assisted coiling. Simple/balloon-assisted coiling suffered 2.6% permanent morbidity. Transient morbidity was observed in 9%, 9.5%, and 6.6% of flow-diverter stenting, stent-assisted coiling, and simple/balloon-assisted coiling, respectively.ConclusionsIn our hospital, about one in a hundred procedures caused lasting problems, while about one in 25 aneurysms needed a second treatment. These results reflect our case selection and multidisciplinary approach. Reporting them transparently helps patients understand what outcomes to expect at our hospital.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Nov 07, 2025",2025,Nov,07,Bernava G|Sandralegar A|Hofmeister J|Rosi A|Yilmaz H|Morel S|Reymond P|Brina O|Muster M|Lovblad K|Schaller K|Bijlenga P|Machi P,Machi P,"Division of Neuroradiology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.|Division of Neurosurgery, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.|HUG NeuroCentre, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Bernava G, Sandralegar A, Hofmeister J, Rosi A, Yilmaz H, Morel S, Reymond P, Brina O, Muster M, Lovblad K, Schaller K, Bijlenga P, Machi P",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41204111/,"The study found that endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms at a single center had a low rate of permanent morbidity (1%) and retreatment (4%), with the best outcomes associated with flow-diverter stenting and stent-assisted coiling.

41203975,Clinicopathologic and molecular characterization of a series of sporadic trichoblastic neoplasms.,"Trichoblastoma (TB) is a benign primitive follicular neoplasm that can occur in the setting of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (CYLD mutations), in association with nevus sebaceous (mosaic HRAS mutations), or sporadically. We studied the histopathologic and molecular features of 16 sporadic trichoblastic neoplasms, including a case of trichogerminoma and a case of trichoblastic carcinoma arising within a TB. Sixteen tumors were identified in nine males and seven females (median age 64 years, range 33-97 years) involving the scalp (4), back (2), nasolabial fold (1), cheek (1), skin overlying the parotid gland (1), nasal ala (1), ear (1), upper chest (1), gluteal region (1), thigh (1), leg (1), and ankle (1) with a median size of 1.6 cm (range 1.2-7.0 cm). Histologically, 16 cases consisted of a dermal multinodular growth of basaloid epithelial cells surrounded by fibrotic stroma without epidermal connection. Malignant transformation was observed in one case, characterized by increased atypia and mitotic activity. Another case exhibited focal areas of ""cell balls,"" indicative of trichogerminoma. RNA sequencing of six tumors showed a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and lacked a UV-related mutational signature, which may help distinguish trichoblastic tumors from potential mimics. Additionally, a FOXK1::GRHL1 fusion was found in the case of trichogerminoma. Clinical follow-up (15/16 patients; 94%; median: 65 months; range 2.5-106.5 months) showed no evidence of residual or metastatic disease.© 2025.

41203598,The RNA N6-methyladenosine methylome coordinates long non-coding RNAs to mediate cancer drug resistance by activating PI3K signaling.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and RNA N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) have been linked to leukemia drug resistance. However, whether and how lncRNAs and m6A coordinately regulate resistance remain elusive. Here, we show that many differentially expressed lncRNAs enrich m6A, and more lncRNAs tend to have higher m6A content in CML cells resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We demonstrate the broad clinical relevance of our findings, showing that upregulation of top-ranked lncRNAs (e.g., SENCR, PROX1-AS1, LINC00892) in TKI-resistant cell lines occurs in CML patients at the diagnostic stage, blast crisis phase, or not responding to TKIs compared to the chronic phase or TKI responders, respectively. Higher lncRNAs predict drug resistance and shorter survival duration. The knockdown of SENCR, PROX1-AS1, or LINC00892 restores TKI sensitivity. Mechanistically, upregulation of PROX1-AS1, SENCR, and LINC00892 results from FTO-dependent m6A hypomethylation that stabilizes lncRNA transcripts and empowers resistant cell growth through overexpression of PI3K signaling mediators (e.g., ITGA2, F2R, COL6A1). Treatment with PI3K inhibitor alpelisib eradicates resistant cells in vitro and in vivo, with prolonged survival of leukemic mice through downregulation of F2R, ITGA2, and COL6A1. Thus, the lncRNA-m6A-PI3K cascade represents a new non-genetic predictor for drug resistance and poorer prognosis in cancer, and a pan-cancer mechanism underlying TKI resistance.© 2025.

41202274,Impact of the extent of tumor resection on adrenal function recovery after transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.,"While endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (ETS) is the standard treatment for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs), the postoperative recovery rates of secondary adrenal insufficiency and their predictive factors remain poorly understood. The authors investigated the relationship between the tumor resection rate and adrenal function recovery in patients with NFPAs.This retrospective study included 450 patients with NFPAs who underwent ETS between January 2013 and November 2023. The rates of preoperative hypopituitarism and postoperative recovery rates of secondary adrenal insufficiency and their associated factors were analyzed. Recovery was defined as normalization of serum cortisol levels without replacement therapy for at least 24 hours, accompanied by symptom resolution. The tumor resection rate was calculated as the percentage of the tumor volume resected.The median follow-up period for the entire cohort was 52 months (range 1-131 months). A total of 246 (55%) patients had dysfunction in one or more pituitary axes. Fifty-three (47%) of 114 patients with preoperative adrenal insufficiency showed postoperative adrenal insufficiency recovery. The cumulative adrenal insufficiency recovery rates were 12% at 1 month, 19% at 3 months, 32% at 6 months, and 41% at 12 months. Among the 114 patients with preoperative adrenal insufficiency, the factors associated with postoperative adrenal insufficiency recovery were investigated. Patients with smaller tumor sizes of < 20 mm (log-rank test, p = 0.001) and those with tumor resection rates of more than 85% (log-rank test, p = 0.032) demonstrated better postoperative adrenal insufficiency improvement. Bivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that smaller tumor sizes (continuous, HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-0.98; p = 0.043) and higher tumor resection rates (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with better postoperative adrenal insufficiency recovery. Multivariable analysis confirmed that only higher tumor resection rates were significantly associated with better postoperative adrenal insufficiency recovery (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.019).Nearly half of the patients with preoperative adrenal insufficiency achieved recovery after ETS for NFPAs. The enhanced extent of tumor removal was an independent factor associated with better postoperative recovery, indicating that optimizing safe maximal resection procedures may be crucial in enhancing adrenal function.",Journal of neurosurgery,"Nov 07, 2025",2025,Nov,07,Shinya Y|Herndon J S|Palit S R|Hong S|Erickson D|Bancos I|Donegan D|Pinheiro Neto C|Meyer F B|Atkinson J L D|Van Gompel J J,Shinya Y|Herndon J S|Palit S R|Hong S|Erickson D|Bancos I|Donegan D|Pinheiro Neto C|Meyer F B|Atkinson J L D|Van Gompel J J,"1Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|2Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.|3Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester; and.|4Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Shinya Y, Herndon J S, Palit S R, Hong S, Erickson D, Bancos I, Donegan D, Pinheiro Neto C, Meyer F B, Atkinson J L D, Van Gompel J J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41202274/,The key finding of this medical research is that a higher rate of tumor removal during transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas is associated with better recovery of adrenal function in patients with preoperative adrenal insufficiency.

41201884,Semaglutide therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: November 2025 updates to AASLD Practice Guidance.,"This practice recommendation serves as an update to the 2023 AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now known as Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) (3) and provides implementable guidance on patient selection for treatment, consideration of comorbidities, and monitoring of treatment safety and efficacy of semaglutide. FDA-indication and Practice Recommendation: The Wegovy® formulation, whose main ingredient is semaglutide, received accelerated FDA approval in August 2025 for treating MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis (consistent with stages F2-F3 fibrosis), based on interim results of the phase 3 ESSENCE trial where 72 weeks of 2.4 mg/week subcutaneous injection resulted in achievement of both primary histologic endpoints: 1) resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis (62.9% vs 34.3% placebo, p<0.001 ) and 2) ≥1 stage reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of MASH (36.8% vs 22.4% placebo, p<0.001); final approval awaits long-term outcomes. Patient Selection: Candidates should have MASH with stage 2-3 fibrosis, identified using noninvasive tests (NITs) such as VCTE (8-15 kPa), MRE (3.1-4.4 kPa), or ELF (9.2-10.5), rather than liver biopsy, which is impractical and unnecessary for most patients. In those with VCTE (15-20 kPa), MRE (4.4-5 kPa), or ELF (10.5-11.3), an individualized decision to treat should be based on exclusion of cirrhosis with another confirmatory NIT, or cross-sectional imaging excluding nodular-appearing liver contour and signs of portal hypertension, or a platelet count of <150,000/mm3. While semaglutide is not approved to treat patients with MASH cirrhosis (VCTE>20 kPa, MRE>5.0 kPa, ELF>11.3 and/or evidence of portal hypertension), those with compensated cirrhosis who are receiving semaglutide for another FDA-approved indication should be monitored carefully. Monitoring and Safety: Semaglutide showed a favorable hepatic safety profile in the ESSENCE trial, with no discontinuations due to liver enzyme elevations. Routine hepatic panels are recommended only as clinically indicated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting), generally mild and transient; patient education and dose titration help improve tolerance. Clinicians should monitor for rare but serious risks, including acute kidney injury (from dehydration), symptomatic gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, thyroid C-cell tumors, retinopathy progression, and lean mass loss. Treatment Response and Concomitant Therapy: Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD/MASH management alongside semaglutide. Combination use with resmetirom at the dose of 2.4 mg/week has not been studied. While no NITs reliably predict histologic response at the individual patient level, reductions from baseline to 72 weeks of treatment suggest significant improvement in MASH resolution (ALT >17 U/L or ≥20%; CAP ≥30%) and fibrosis improvement (VCTE LSM ≥30%; MRE LSM ≥20%; ELF≥0.5). Non-response may be suspected if ALT or NITs worsen. Benefit is uncertain if sub-optimal response and may require an individualized approach and further follow-up.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Nov 07, 2025",2025,Nov,07,Bansal M B|Patton H|Morgan T R|Carr R M|Dranoff J|Allen A M,Allen A M,"Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.|Gastroenterology Section, VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.|Gastroenterology Section, Medical Service, VA Long Beach Healthcare System, Long Beach, CA.|Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA.|Division of Gastroenterology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.|Yale University, New Haven CT.|VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.|Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Bansal M B, Patton H, Morgan T R, Carr R M, Dranoff J, Allen A M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41201884/,"The key finding of this medical research is that the drug semaglutide has been approved by the FDA for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with moderate to advanced fibrosis.

41201710,Optimizing coronary CT angiography with spectral dual-layer CT: motion-compensated virtual monoenergetic imaging achieves 50% contrast dose reduction in a phantom study.,"Reduced contrast media (CM) dose at elevated heart rates (HRs) poses a challenge for coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment. Using a dynamic phantom, we evaluated the performance of a vendor-specific coronary motion-compensated reconstruction (MCR) at various simulated HRs and reduced CM dose in low virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). A clinical CCTA protocol was used to image a 5-mm artificial coronary artery, filled with 100% (400 Hounsfield units (HU)) and 50% CM dose, using a robotic arm for translation at six velocities (0-50 mm/s, 10 mm/s steps). Conventional images and VMIs (40-70 keV, 10 keV steps) were reconstructed without and with MCR. The study evaluated the MCR influence on motion area and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the resulting segmented arteries (motion area), with the static conventional reconstructed artery at 100% CM dose as the reference, and non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals with the reference indicating significant differences. At 50% CM dose, motion area increased significantly (up to 50%) at elevated velocities (≥ 30 mm/s) without MCR, while no significant variations were observed with MCR. Additionally, without MCR, VMIs exhibited significant CNR decreases (up to 65%) at velocities ≥ 30 mm/s. Only the combination of MCR and 40 keV VMI achieved CNR comparable to the reference, regardless of HR. The combination of MCR with low VMIs enables 50% CM dose reduction, with similar motion area and CNR when compared to conventional CCTA with 100% CM dose. These parameter settings can potentially be used to optimize low CM dose CCTA at higher HRs.© 2025.

41201255,Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence to Improve Kidney Care: A Statement from the American Society of Nephrology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the delivery of kidney care through predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI technologies. To meet this challenge, the American Society of Nephrology convened an AI Workgroup to provide a framework for the responsible use of AI in nephrology. The group outlines foundational principles to guide AI development: prioritizing patient benefit, ensuring clinician oversight, and advancing innovation in high-burden disease areas. Its set of foundational assumptions are grounded in the physician always being in the loop and an overarching goal to benefit patients with kidney disease. This review provides an overview of the clinical uses of AI in nephrology and offers practical guidance for nephrologists seeking to incorporate AI into CKD and AKI management, dialysis, and transplantation care.

41201016,Steap4 Promotes Senile Osteoporosis via Fe2+-ROS/C/EBPβ Feedback-Driven Ferroptosis and Adipogenesis in Senescent BMSCs.,"Senile osteoporosis (SOP) is a systemic bone disease characterized by increased susceptibility to fractures. In this study, it is found that senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exhibit increased sensitivity to ferroptosis, a phenomenon associated with Steap4, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH)-dependent metalloreductase that reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+. Therefore, it is aimed to innovatively elucidate how Steap4 affects ferroptosis in senescent BMSCs. These findings indicate that Steap4 promotes intracellular Fe2+ accumulation and elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, collectively driving the upregulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) expression. Interestingly, a functional C/EBPβ binding site is identified within the Steap4 promoter region. Mechanistically, knockdown studies demonstrated that C/EBPβ depletion attenuated Steap4 expression, whereas C/EBPβ overexpression conversely upregulated Steap4 levels. These regulatory processes establish a self-amplifying Steap4/Fe2+-ROS/C/EBPβ positive feedback loop. Notably, a large number of adipocytes are also observed in the bone marrow of aged mice. Knockdown of Steap4 and C/EBPβ suppressed the differentiation of BMSCs into adipocytes. Knockdown of Steap4 or deferoxamine (DFO) treatment in animal experiments effectively relieves SOP. In conclusion, Steap4 accelerates the onset of ferroptosis in senescent BMSCs and promotes their differentiation to adipocytes through the Steap4/Fe2+-ROS/C/EBPβ axis, ultimately impairing their osteogenic capacity.© 2025 The Author(s).

41200866,Association between Human Leukocyte Antigen Alleles and Neuropathological Outcomes in Lewy Body Disease.,"Lewy body disease (LBD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in the brain. Neuroinflammation has long been implicated in LBD pathogenesis, and recent genetic studies in Parkinson's disease (a clinical manifestation of LBD) have shown consistent association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex. Here, we assessed whether variation in HLA alleles influences neuropathological burden in a neuropathologically-defined series of LBD cases.We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HLA allelic variants in a cohort of 539 LBD cases of European descent from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. High-resolution whole-genome sequencing was used, and the HLA alleles of each sample were called using the HLA*LA tool and assessed for association with neuropathological outcomes.Our analysis identified 1 significant (P < 3.43 × 10-5) and 4 suggestive (P < 0.001) associations between certain HLA alleles and specific neuropathological outcomes in LBD, suggesting a potential role for HLA-mediated immune mechanisms in disease progression and subtype differentiation. Specifically, HLA-DPB1*06:01 was significantly associated with lower Lewy body counts in the parahippocampal gyrus (P = 3.30 × 10-5), with weaker and suggestive associations observed in the middle frontal (P = 1.80 × 10-4) and inferior parietal gyrus (P = 6.33 × 10-4). Additionally, although only suggestive, HLA-DRB1*11:01 correlated with a lower Thal amyloid phase (P = 1.56 x 10-4), and HLA-B*15:01 correlated with an increased risk of diffuse LBD (P = 7.58 x 10-4).This study provides a detailed evaluation of the relationship between HLA alleles and LBD pathology, highlighting the importance of immune-related genetic factors in the etiology of LBD.

41199626,A Multicenter Double-blind Randomized Sham-controlled Trial Assessing the EndoBarrier Duodenal-jejunal Bypass Liner for the Treatment of Poorly Controlled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Concomitant Obesity: The ENDO Trial.,"An endoscopically placed duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) may provide a safe adjunctive therapy for those with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity.While some endoscopic therapies have been shown to improve glycemic indices secondary to weight loss, small bowel interventions may have direct metabolic effects. A meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated reduction in HbA1c by 1.3% at one year following DJBL in patients with T2DM and obesity.This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial comparing DJBL to sham procedure with medical management and lifestyle modification. Primary endpoints included mean difference in changes in HbA1c at 12 months between arms, and device-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary endpoints included percent total weight loss (%TWL) and subjects achieving HbA1c≤7% and TWL≥5% at 12 months.320 subjects were randomized to DJBL (n=212) and sham (n=108). Baseline HbA1c and BMI were 8.79±0.92% and 38.45±5.75 kg/m2. On modified intent-to-treat analysis, change in HbA1c at 12 months was -1.10±1.45% and -0.28±1.54% for DJBL and sham groups, respectively (P=0.0004). Rate of device-related SAEs was 9.4% including intolerance (3.7%), hemorrhage (2.8%) and hepatic abscess (2.3% stopping study early). At 12 months, DJBL group experienced greater weight loss compared to sham (7.7±9.6% TWL and 2.1±5.4% TWL, respectively; P<0.0001), with significantly more patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 7% (28.3% vs. 9.4%; P<0.0003) and TWL ≥ 5% (60.4% vs. 21.3%; P<0.0001).DJBL met primary glycemic control efficacy and primary safety endpoints, while providing clinically significant weight loss, and comorbidity improvement.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41199442,Loss of Enhancement in Vestibular Schwannomas Post Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Impact on Tumor Control and Serviceable Hearing.,"Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) often show transient loss of central tumor enhancement. We hypothesized that this loss of enhancement may correlate with better tumor control on follow-up imaging.We evaluated 198 consecutive patients from a single center who met eligibility criteria. Tumor volumes on the pre-SRS and post-SRS scans were quantified along with regions of loss of enhancement on the first post-SRS study. The latter was correlated with tumor volumes at follow-up, radiation isocenter density, and loss of serviceable hearing.For the entire cohort, the median loss of enhancement on the first post-SRS scan was 14% (IQR: 6 to 25) and median rate of change in tumor volume was -4.5% per year (IQR: -10.5 to 1.5). Percent loss of central enhancement showed significant negative correlation with tumor growth not only for the entire cohort (correlation coefficient: -0.18, P=0.01), but also for the subset of patients who had available imaging until at least 2 years (n=185) and 4 years (n=179) post-SRS. Loss of enhancement also strongly correlated positively with tumor volumes and number of radiation isocenters and negatively with isocenter density. Finally, patients with greater percent loss of enhancement had an increased likelihood of progression to non-serviceable hearing, although this association was not statistically significant.These findings suggest that loss of central tumor enhancement in VSs post-SRS may be associated with improved tumor control.Copyright © 2025, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",Otol Neurotol,"Nov 07, 2025",2025,Nov,07,Mehta P|Soni N|Benson J C|Morshed R|Lohse C M|Agarwal A|Sonka M|Link M J|Marinelli J P|Babajanian E E|Daher G|Dornhoffer J R|Khandalavala K R|Carlson M L|Farnsworth P J|Lane J I|Bathla G,Mehta P|Soni N|Benson J C|Morshed R|Lohse C M|Agarwal A|Link M J|Marinelli J P|Babajanian E E|Daher G|Dornhoffer J R|Khandalavala K R|Carlson M L|Farnsworth P J|Lane J I|Bathla G,"Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.|Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Department of Neurosurgery, UCSF, San Francisco, CA.|Departments of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|College of Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","Mehta P, Soni N, Benson J C, Morshed R, Lohse C M, Agarwal A, Sonka M, Link M J, Marinelli J P, Babajanian E E, Daher G, Dornhoffer J R, Khandalavala K R, Carlson M L, Farnsworth P J, Bathla G, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41199442/,The key finding of this medical research is that the loss of central tumor enhancement in vestibular schwannomas after stereotactic radiosurgery is associated with better tumor control and slower growth. This suggests that the loss of enhancement may be a useful indicator of the effectiveness of the treatment and could help predict the long-term outcomes for patients with this type of brain tumor.
