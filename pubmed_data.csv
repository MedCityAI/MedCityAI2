41478859,2026-01-02,Relapsed rhabdoid tumours and other non-nephroblastoma childhood and adolescent kidney tumours: perspectives from the HARMONICA collaboration.,"Paediatric kidney tumours are generally associated with a favourable survival rate. Most children are diagnosed with Wilms tumour, which has a 90% long-term survival rate with conventional front-line and salvage therapies. However, treatments and outcomes of children with relapsed non-Wilms tumours, such as malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, renal-cell carcinoma (including renal medullary carcinoma), clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney, anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are not well defined. Several of these non-Wilms tumours include unfavourable prognostic subtypes. Currently available data on non-Wilms tumours support advancing studies that pivot from conventional strategies towards disease-specific, biologically driven novel treatments to improve outcomes for each of these rare childhood kidney tumours.© 2026.

The researchers reviewed data on patients with relapsed or difficult-to-treat kidney tumors other than Wilms. They found that these non-Wilms tumors include subtypes with particularly poor prognoses, and that current treatment strategies are often not effective.

Prevalence and magnitude weight loss among collegiate wrestlers. J Strength Cond Res 40(1): 90-97, 2026-The purpose of this study was to examine the percentage of wrestlers who compete in their minimal weight class (MWC), and the magnitude of weight loss. Data from the 2023-2024 collegiate season were retrospectively analyzed resulting in a sample of 9,638 collegiate male wrestlers from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( n = 1,904) and all 3 divisions of the National Collegiate Athletics Association ( n = 7,734). All wrestlers completed skinfold assessments for weight certification at the start of the competition season. The lowest recorded weight class (LRW) achieved by each wrestler during the season was also recorded and used to determine magnitude of weight loss. Out of the 4,605 (53.2%) of wrestlers who competed in their MWC, their average amount of weight loss was significantly higher than those who did not compete in their MWC (3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.2 ± 2.9 kg.; p < 0.001), yet they had an initial lower body fat percentage (12.7 ± 2.9 vs. 17.5 ± 4.8%; p < 0.001). At the time of weight certification, wrestlers weighed 8.1 ± 4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.0-8.2; effect size (ES) = 1.8) kg more than their minimal wrestling weight. The LRW was 3.6 ± 2.9 (95% CI: 3.6-3.7; ES = 1.2) kg lower than their weight at the time of weight certification. Given that slightly more than half of the male wrestlers competed in their MWC, coaches and sports practitioners should recognize that not all athletes follow the traditional assumption of cutting to the lowest possible weight class. Importantly, those who did achieve their MWC had lower initial body fat percentages, limiting the amount of weight they could safely lose. This underscores the need for individualized weight management strategies that consider body composition and health implications.Copyright © 2025 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",Journal of strength and conditioning research,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Andrew R Jagim|Ward C Dobbs|Craig A Horswill|Eric Twohey|Jennifer B Fields|Margaret T Jones,Andrew R Jagim|Eric Twohey,"Department of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Exercise and Sport Science, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Department of Physical Therapy, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin.|Emertius, Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut; and.|School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia.","Andrew R Jagim, Ward C Dobbs, Craig A Horswill, Eric Twohey, Jennifer B Fields, Margaret T Jones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961344/,"This study examined the weight loss practices of collegiate wrestlers, an important issue in a sport where athletes must compete in specific weight classes. The researchers analyzed data from over 9,600 male wrestlers across different college athletic associations.

Those who made their minimum weight had lower body fat percentages to begin with, limiting the amount of weight they could safely lose. Overall, the wrestlers weighed about 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) more at the start of the season than their minimum competition weight. This highlights that not all wrestlers follow the common assumption of cutting to the absolute lowest weight class.

40998187,2026-01-02,Exploring the cardiopulmonary effects of tirzepatide in atrial fibrillation and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The coexistence of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often leads to worse clinical outcomes. Tirzepatide is a promising therapy for diabetes and weight management, with potential cardiovascular benefits via anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impact in patients with both atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown.Using the TriNetX Analytics Research Network, patients aged ≥18 years with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between 6/1/2022 and 1/1/2024 were included. Patients were divided into tirzepatide and control groups. Propensity score matching included demographics, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiac events, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation over one year.A total of 3,728 tirzepatide users and 499,199 controls were identified; 3,726 patients remained in each group after matching. Tirzepatide use was associated with lower odds of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR: 0.145; 95% CI: 0.115-0.184), hospitalization (OR: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.258-0.313), stroke (OR: 0.619; 95% CI: 0.519-0.738), cardiac arrest (OR: 0.491; 95% CI: 0.362-0.667), heart failure exacerbation (OR: 0.270; 95% CI: 0.236-0.308), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (OR: 0.586; 95% CI: 0.513-0.671). Lower odds of anti-arrhythmic drug initiation, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation were also observed.Tirzepatide use was associated with improved mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced need for rhythm control interventions.

They found that tirzepatide use was associated with lower risks of death, hospitalization, stroke, heart failure, and COPD flare-ups over one year. Patients on tirzepatide also needed fewer treatments to control their abnormal heart rhythms. These findings suggest tirzepatide may have important cardiovascular and respiratory benefits for this high-risk patient group, potentially reducing their burden of disease and need for intensive medical care. However, more research is needed to confirm these results, as this was an observational study rather than a controlled clinical trial. Overall, this work highlights the promise of tirzepatide as a treatment that could improve outcomes for patients struggling with both atrial fibrillation and COPD.",,
40993340,2026-01-02,Increased expression of ATase1/NAT8B or ATase2/NAT8 in the mouse results in an autistic-like phenotype with altered dendritic branching and spine formation.,"Neurons heavily depend on the ability of the secretory pathway to deliver correctly folded polypeptides to the periphery of the cell for the assembly, maintenance, and normal functioning of synapses. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acetylation machinery has emerged as a novel branch of the more general ER quality control machinery. It regulates the positive selection of correctly folded nascent glycoproteins, thus ensuring the efficiency of the conventional secretory pathway. ER acetylation requires the activity of two ER-luminal acetylCoA:lysine acetyltransferases, ATase1/NAT8B and ATase2/NAT8. Both acetyltransferases depend on the influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER from the cytosol, which is ensured by the coordinated action of the citrate transporters, SLC25A1 and SLC13A5, and the ER acetyl-CoA transporter, AT-1. Gene duplication events affecting ATase1 and ATase2 are associated with rare disease phenotypes that include autism and intellectual disability with dysmorphism. Here, we generated mice with neuron-specific overexpression of human ATase1 or ATase2. The animals display autistic-like behaviors with altered synaptic plasticity, altered neuronal morphology, and altered synaptic structure and function. Mechanistic assessment demonstrates that widespread proteomic changes and altered dynamics of the secretory pathway underly the synaptic defects. The phenotype of ATase1 and ATase2 overexpressing mice is reminiscent of SLC25A1, SLC13A5 and AT-1 overexpressing models. Therefore, when taken together, our results support the argument that the intracellular citrate/acetyl-CoA pathway, with the ATases acting as the last output, is immediately connected to the pathogenesis of certain rare forms of autism spectrum disorder.© 2025.

The study focused on two enzymes, called ATase1 and ATase2, that play a crucial role in the proper folding and transport of proteins within brain cells. The researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce these enzymes in neurons, and found that the mice exhibited behavioral traits reminiscent of autism, such as altered social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Further analysis revealed that the overexpression of ATase1 or ATase2 disrupted the normal structure and function of synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate. This appears to be due to widespread changes in the proteins produced by the cells and disturbances in the cellular machinery responsible for protein transport and secretion. Importantly, the researchers noted that these findings align with previous studies on other proteins involved in regulating the availability of acetyl-CoA, a key molecule required for the acetylation process carried out by ATase1 and ATase2. Together, these results suggest that dysregulation of this intracellular acet",,
40988507,2026-01-02,Incorporating Machine Learning Driven Factors in the Design of Electronic-triggers to Detect Diagnostic Errors in the Emergency Department.,"Electronic health records (EHR)-based triggers (eTriggers) have been used to study diagnostic errors in the emergency department (ED), often with suboptimal performance. Our objective was to investigate incremental value of multi-factor machine learning (ML) approaches to improve eTrigger performance.Patients presenting to an academic ED were categorized into trigger-positive and trigger-negative using standard trigger (T) definitions: (T1) ED return visits resulting in admission within 10 days; (T2) care escalation from the inpatient unit to the ICU within 24 hours; and (T3) deaths within 24 hours of admission. We trained and evaluated 6 supervised ML models.A total of 124,053 consecutive encounters (5791 T-positive and 118,262 T-negative) were included. Among the T-positive, 4159 (72%) were associated with T1, 1415 (24%) with T2, and 217 (4%) with T3. The T-based positive predictive values (PPV) were 5.2% for T1, 8.2% for T2, and 6.5% for T3. ML models trained and evaluated on balanced training dataset and imbalanced test set had low classification performances (accuracy: 0.72-0.95; PPV: 0.00-0.16; F1-score: 0.00-0.23). Higher performances were observed in balanced test sets (accuracy: 0.80-0.97; PPV: 0.82-1.00; F1-score: 0.79-0.97). Comparing models trained on clinically annotated data with models trained on T-based labels identified other important factors.Utilizing machine learning to refine e-triggers slightly improves the identification of diagnostic errors, as evidenced by an increase in PPV values.

The AI models performed better than the standard triggers at correctly identifying true diagnostic errors, with accuracy rates up to 97% when tested on balanced datasets. This suggests machine learning could help refine trigger systems to catch more errors while reducing false positives. The study also revealed new factors that may contribute to diagnostic mistakes in EDs, opening up new avenues for improving error detection. While promising, the findings have limitations, as the models were tested on data from a single hospital. More research is needed to validate the approach across different healthcare settings.

40984676,2026-01-02,Transitional Fracture Patterns of the Pediatric Distal Radius.,"Distal radius fractures involving the physis are among the most common upper extremity injuries in children and adolescents. Unlike transitional fractures of the distal tibia, known as Tillaux and triplane fractures, transitional fractures of the distal radius have not been well characterized. This study aims to evaluate Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius in the pediatric transitional age population to determine if a characteristic fracture pattern exists analogous to the distal tibia. We hypothesized that pediatric transitional fractures of the distal radius would follow a pattern that would ultimately dictate treatment and predict outcomes.A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with transitional fractures of the distal radius at a single institution was performed. Salter-Harris III and IV fractures of the distal radius with CT imaging were included. Two independent reviewers determined the metaphyseal fracture plane and the major intra-articular epiphyseal fracture fragments. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.Thirty patients who met inclusion criteria made the study cohort. There were 5 Salter-Harris III fractures and 25 Salter-Harris IV fractures. Mean age at the time of injury was 15±1.5 years. The metaphyseal fracture demonstrated a coronal fracture plane in all cases, and 20% had a sagittal plane component. The major epiphyseal fracture fragments were identified as dorsal ulnar corner in 70%, radial column in 43%, volar rim in 30%, and dorsal wall in 17%. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (N=12, 40%), closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (N=4, 13%), or cast immobilization (N=14, 47%). Most patients (N=24, 80%) did not demonstrate a growth disturbance after treatment. Angular deformity, however, was significantly higher in patients with a primary dorsal ulnar corner epiphyseal fragment (N=4, 19% vs. N=0%, P =0.03).Transitional fractures of the distal radius occurred on average at age 15. The injuries demonstrated a consistent pattern, with a coronal fracture plane in the metaphysis and a dorsal ulnar corner fragment in most epiphyses. The dorsal physis may be the strongest portion of the distal radius at the time of injury, though mechanism of injury may impact patterns as well.Level III.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They review the existing research on using plasma volume expansion (increasing fluid levels) to treat acute kidney injury in cirrhosis patients, and discuss the pros and cons of this approach. 

The key finding is that while plasma volume expansion can be helpful in some cases, it needs to be carefully monitored to avoid complications.

40972771,2026-01-02,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 β Hepatocyte Deletion Attenuates Ferroptosis and Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis in Mice.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is characterized by toxic lipid-induced cellular stress (lipotoxicity), which culminates in lethal and sublethal hepatocyte injury and a sterile fibroinflammatory response. We previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) ameliorates murine MASH. However, the hepatocyte-specific role of GSK3β in lipotoxic injury and the fibroinflammatory response in MASH remains unclear.We generated hepatocyte-specific Gsk3β knockout (Gsk3βΔHep) mice by crossing Gsk3βfl/fl mice with albumin-Cre mice. Mice were fed either a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD) or a high-fat, fructose, and cholesterol (FFC) diet to induce MASH.Metabolic parameters and hepatic lipidomic were similar between FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep and Gsk3βfl/fl mice. The NanoString Metabolic Pathways Panel on liver tissues showed upregulation of NAD, mitochondrial function, and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in FFC-fed Gsk3βΔHep mice compared with Gsk3βfl/fl mice. In vitro studies in palmitate-treated hepatocytes showed that mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis, contact with lipid droplets, and respiration were improved, whereas mitochondrial DNA release and Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) phase separation were reduced with pharmacological GSK3 inhibition or in hepatocytes isolated from Gsk3βΔHep mice. Similarly, liver injury, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis markers, and circulating mitochondrial DNA levels were reduced in Gsk3βΔHep mice with MASH.

MASH is characterized by the buildup of harmful fats in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, cell damage, and scarring. The researchers investigated the role of a protein called glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the development of MASH.

By genetically modifying mice to lack GSK3β in their liver cells, the researchers found that this protected the mice from the damaging effects of a high-fat, high-sugar diet that normally induces MASH. The mice with the GSK3β deletion showed improved mitochondrial function and reduced levels of a type of cell death called ferroptosis, which is linked to MASH. They also had less inflammation and scarring in the liver compared to mice with normal GSK3β levels.

These findings suggest that targeting GSK3β could be a promising therapeutic approach for MASH in humans. By preserving mitochondrial health and preventing ferroptosis, inhibiting GSK3β may help protect liver cells from the toxic",,
40970720,2026-01-02,Predictors of Intracranial Aneurysm Residual Filling After Treatment With Flow Diversion at Early Follow-up: A Multicenter Experience of 2277 Patients.,"Flow-diverting stents (FDSs) have improved treatment options for intracranial aneurysms. Although FDS have proven successful in treating aneurysms that would previously have required complex microsurgical or endovascular repairs, treatment failures remain a concern. In this multicenter study, we aim to analyze the predictors of residual aneurysmal filling at early angiographic follow-up.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained neuroendovascular database at 14 high-volume US centers was conducted for all patients who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysms between 2011 and 2019. Aneurysms were graded on the O'Kelly-Marotta scale (OKM).A total of 2277 patients underwent FDS embolization for intracranial aneurysms during the study period. The patient's mean age was 55 (SD ± 13.5) years, and 82% were female. The median maximal aneurysm diameter was 6.7 mm (IQR 4.10-11 mm). Complete aneurysm obliteration (OKM grade 4) occurred in 1109 patients (68%), and 146 (9%) were OKM grade 3, 188 (12%) were OKM grade 2, and 174 (11%) were OKM grade 1. In the adjusted multivariate analysis, individuals in the 65-74 years and 75+ years age groups had significantly increased risk of residual aneurysm filling at 6-month follow-up compared with the 18-44 years age group (odds ratio [OR] 1.92 (95% CI: 1.33-2.78) and 2.92 (95% CI: 1.79-4.77), respectively). Aneurysms arising from the superior cerebellar artery, the basilar artery, and the carotid terminus were more likely to have a residual filling (OR 12.6, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 4.27, 95% CI: 1.39-14.7; OR 3.16, 95% CI: 1.24-8.06, respectively).As the utilization of FDS for intracranial aneurysms becomes more widespread, the efficacy of aneurysm obliteration needs to be assessed. Our results indicate that several patient-dependent factors, such as age, aneurysm location, and size, predict the likelihood of residual aneurysm filling 6 months post-treatment.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

Intracranial aneurysms are bulges or weaknesses in the brain's blood vessels that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. Flow-diverting stents are a newer treatment that can help seal off these aneurysms and prevent rupture. However, in some cases, the aneurysm may not be fully sealed, leaving residual filling that could lead to complications. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 2,200 patients who underwent flow-diverter treatment at 14 different medical centers. They found that older patients, especially those over 65, were more likely to have residual aneurysm filling after treatment. Aneurysms located in certain areas of the brain, like the superior cerebellar artery or basilar artery, were also more prone to incomplete sealing. This information can help doctors better predict which patients and aneurysms may require closer monitoring or additional treatment after flow-diverter placement",,

Congenital CMV is a common viral infection that can cause hearing loss and other health problems in babies. However, many infants with CMV are not identified at birth without specific screening tests. The researchers examined birth records in Minnesota to estimate how many babies were born with congenital CMV before and after the implementation of two different screening approaches: 1) screening only infants who failed newborn hearing tests, and 2) universal screening of all newborns. 

The results showed that the birth prevalence of congenital CMV was about 3 times higher after hearing-targeted screening was introduced, and 18 times higher after universal newborn screening was implemented. This indicates that most infants with congenital CMV are missed without systematic screening programs. Early detection is important because it allows doctors to monitor these babies and provide appropriate care and treatment to prevent or manage potential health issues. While universal screening identified the most cases, even hearing-targeted screening significantly improved detection compared to no screening at all.

Systematic reviews aim to comprehensively analyze all available research on a given topic, but the authors argue that a one-size-fits-all approach to synthesizing this evidence is often insufficient. 

The researchers examined different systematic review questions and found that the most appropriate method for combining and analyzing the data can vary widely depending on the research topic and goals. For example, some reviews may need to focus on pooling numerical data to determine an overall effect size, while others may be better served by a more narrative, thematic analysis of the included studies. 

The key finding is that systematic reviewers must carefully consider the nuances of their research question and select the synthesis method that is best suited to answer it. This is crucial for ensuring the review provides meaningful, actionable insights that can inform clinical practice and future research. While systematic reviews are a powerful tool, the authors caution that blindly applying a generic approach can lead to flawed or misleading conclusions.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with early-onset PARK23 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), highlighting its importance in mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis.Cases were identified through the Mayo Clinic Data Explorer. We included all subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PD who tested positive for a heterozygous VPS13C variant defined as pathogenic by the ACMG guidelines.DaT-SCAN imaging was consistent with PD diagnosis in three patients. Non-motor symptoms and cognitive impairment were prominent phenotypical characteristics in all cases: all the patients presented with insomnia, anxiety, depression, severe fatigue, and short-memory loss. The response to oral levodopa treatment was suboptimal, with an initial benefit followed by rapid decreased responsiveness. Additionally, two patients developed wearing-off episodes and one of them also exhibited treatment-induced dyskinesias.We hypothesize that VPS13C may confer an increased risk of EOPD in carriers of pathogenic variants, and may function as a phenotype modifier gene, contributing to significant non-motor symptoms development and suboptimal levodopa response. Specifically, we propose that the suboptimal treatment response is associated with a decrease level of dopamine L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1).Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers found that these patients experienced significant non-motor symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and memory problems. Importantly, they also had a poor response to levodopa treatment, with an initial benefit that rapidly declined. The researchers hypothesize that the VPS13C mutation may increase the risk of developing Parkinson's at a younger age, and also act as a modifier, contributing to the development of debilitating non-motor symptoms and a suboptimal response to the primary Parkinson's medication.

40921325,2026-01-02,Endovascular Treatment Protocol for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Ten-Year Experience.,"To investigate whether endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), performed whenever anatomically feasible, would be superior in a real-world registry.Retrospective analysis of consecutive RAAA patients treated at the emergency department of a single hospital from January 2011 to December 2023, after implementation of protocol-based care. The variables of interest were hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and type of intervention. The outcomes were 30-day mortality and long-term survival. Statistical analyses were conducted using the chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Pearson correlation. Logistic regression was used to construct a propensity score for matching, and survival rates were illustrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.Among 209 treated patients, anatomical location included infrarenal, isolated iliac, and juxta-renal aneurysms. Endovascular repair was performed in 121 patients (57.9%), with a significant difference in proximal neck length compared to the open repair group (median 19.7 mm vs. 7.9 mm, P < 0.001). Hemodynamic instability was present in 39% at admission. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 44%; endovascular repair was associated with lower mortality (34.7%, P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval: 0.263-0.431) before matching. Factors such as kidney failure, hemodynamic stability, proximal neck length, and morphology were significantly associated with mortality outcomes. However, propensity score matching (PSM, 42 pairs) revealed no statistical superiority of either technique.While initial analysis indicated lower 30-day mortality in the endovascular group, PSM revealed no significant difference in either 30-day or long-term mortality between endovascular and open repair when anatomically feasible. Intervention choices should be tailored based on individual anatomical circumstances, the expertise of the medical team, and the resources at hand. Our propensity score analysis was the first to consider anatomical features; nevertheless, endovascular repair demonstrated no clear superiority to open repair.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The researchers looked at 209 patients treated for RAAA over 10 years at a single hospital. They compared two surgical options: open repair, where the abdomen is opened to directly fix the aneurysm, and endovascular repair, a less invasive procedure done through small incisions. The researchers found that initially, endovascular repair had lower 30-day mortality rates. However, after accounting for factors like patients' anatomy and overall health, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two surgical approaches.

Chronic angina, which is refractory to medical and interventional therapies, affects patients who are not suitable for revascularization, patients following successful revascularization, and patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. Coronary sinus (CS) narrowing has been studied as a potential therapy for patients with angina. Pre-clinical and clinical data, including 2 randomized sham-controlled clinical trials and 2 large prospective multi-center registries, have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of CS narrowing in patients with refractory angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Preliminary pathophysiologic studies suggest that CS narrowing may also improve coronary microvascular function and alleviate microvascular angina. Here, we review the historical perspective, mechanism of action, and clinical applications of CS narrowing.

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies up to December 2024 that compared BESG and SESG for IBD during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms. A total of 1,107 articles were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. End points included a composite of all endoleaks, types 1b, 1c, and 3 endoleaks, buttock claudication, IIA occlusion, and IBD-related reinterventions during follow-up.Four cohort studies met the eligibility criteria with 684 patients treated with 711 IBDs. 460 (64.7%) BESGs and 251 (35.3%) SESGs were used in the target IIAs.

40912385,2026-01-02,Extracoronary Arterial Pathologies in Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of acute coronary syndrome and has been associated with extracoronary arteriopathies, such as fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), aneurysms, and dissections across other vascular beds. However, these associations remain understudied in the literature. This study aims to characterize the prevalence and distribution of extracoronary arteriopathies in a large cohort of SCAD patients. Patients diagnosed with SCAD were extracted from 2018 to 2024. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were collected. Available vascular imaging, including echocardiograms, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance, were used to assess for extracoronary arteriopathies. The prevalence and location of FMD, aneurysms, and dissections in extracoronary vascular beds were documented. Among 1,380 SCAD patients, 564 (40.9%) were found to have FMD, 166 (12.0%) had extra-coronary arterial dissections, and 228 (16.5%) had aneurysms in at least 1 extracoronary vascular bed. The most common sites of FMD were renal, carotid, vertebral, and iliac/femoral arteries. Aneurysms were most frequently located in cerebral, carotid, renal, and splenic arteries. Dissections were most prevalent in the carotid, vertebral, extremity, and celiac arteries. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were rare, with only 4 patients showing thoracic aortic dissection. Extracoronary arteriopathies are prevalent in patients with SCAD, affecting more than 47% of the cohort described here. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive vascular imaging in patients with SCAD to detect extracoronary vascular abnormalities, which may have implications for surveillance and management strategies.Published by Elsevier Inc.",The American journal of cardiology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Hoang N Pham|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,Hend Bcharah|George Bcharah|Hussein A Nabi|Luke Dreher|Ramzi Ibrahim|Mahmoud Abdelnabi|Chirstopher Kanaan|Sant Kumar|Linnea M Baudhuin|Yuxiang Wang|Mayowa A Osundiji|Fadi E Shamoun,"Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.

SCAD can cause heart attacks, and previous research has linked it to other vascular problems like aneurysms and abnormal artery development. The researchers reviewed medical records and imaging scans of over 1,300 SCAD patients to look for these extracoronary arterial issues. They found that nearly half of the SCAD patients had at least one additional vascular condition, most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia (an abnormal artery structure), aneurysms, or dissections in other blood vessels like the carotid, renal, and cerebral arteries. These findings suggest that SCAD patients may benefit from comprehensive vascular screening to detect and monitor any related conditions, which could inform their long-term treatment and management. While the study provides important insights, its retrospective nature means the true prevalence of these vascular abnormalities in SCAD patients may differ.

40910475,2026-01-02,Genetically determined body mass index is associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in polygenic and Mendelian randomization analyses.,"Obesity has been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but the evidence is inconclusive. We examined the association between genetically determined adiposity and four common NHL subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone lymphoma, using eight genome-wide association studies of European ancestry (N = 10,629 cases, 9505 controls) and constructing polygenic scores for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Higher genetically determined BMI was associated with an increased risk of DLBCL [odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05-1.33, p = .005]. This finding was consistent with Mendelian randomization analyses, which demonstrated a similar increased risk of DLBCL with higher genetically determined BMI (ORper SD = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = .03). No significant associations were observed with other NHL subtypes. Our study demonstrates a positive link between a genetically determined BMI and an increased risk of DLBCL, providing additional support for increased adiposity as a risk factor for DLBCL.© 2025 International Agency for Research on Cancer; licensed by UICC and The Author(s).

genetic makeup and their risk of developing a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The researchers used data from multiple large studies to look at whether people with genetic variants associated with higher body mass index (BMI) - a measure of body fat - were more likely to develop DLBCL compared to other types of lymphoma. 

The results showed that people with a higher genetically-determined BMI had an increased risk of developing DLBCL, but not other lymphoma subtypes. This suggests that excess body fat, driven by genetic factors, may be a risk factor specifically for DLBCL. The researchers used an analytical method called Mendelian randomization to further support this finding, strengthening the evidence for a causal link between higher BMI and DLBCL risk. 

These findings provide important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying lymphoma development and could help identify individuals at higher risk of DLBCL based on their genetic profile. While more research is needed, this study highlights the value of using genetic data to understand how physical",,
40907858,2026-01-02,Association of Maternal Cardiac Disease and Echocardiographic Parameters With Neonatal Outcomes.,"Women with cardiac disease have worse neonatal outcomes compared to women without cardiac disease; risk factors are not well-defined. We hypothesized that structural heart disease, as assessed by echocardiography, is a noninvasive metric for abnormal hemodynamics and an unfavorable maternal-fetal environment. We assessed the association between echocardiographic markers of structural heart disease in women with cardiac disease and a primary endpoint of adverse neonatal outcomes operationalized as neonates with small-for-gestational-age birth weight, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit/transition care unit admission, or neonatal/fatal demise. Women with cardiac disease who delivered at a tertiary care center between 2014 and 2022 were included. Echocardiographic parameters and neonatal outcomes were collected. A subgroup analysis was performed among women with congenital heart disease (CHD). Among 1,108 women, maternal diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.8-18.6), hypertensive disease (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.4-6.2), CHD (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8), and cardiomyopathy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.8) were associated with the primary endpoint. Peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity was associated with the primary endpoint (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1). Biventricular function and severity of valvular disease were not associated with the primary endpoint in the total study population and in the CHD subgroup. In conclusion, maternal cardiac diagnosis is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Structural heart disease as assessed by echocardiography was not predictive of adverse neonatal outcomes. Large-scale studies are needed to identify drivers of adverse neonatal outcomes in women with cardiac disease.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The sensor is a small capsule that the patient swallows, and it can send information about any bleeding directly to the doctor's computer. The study found that this sensor was able to accurately detect upper GI bleeding in most patients, and using this sensor could reduce the need for other expensive tests or procedures. This could lead to faster diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare spending.

They found that certain medications used to treat diabetes, heart conditions, and infections, as well as some common vaccines, were associated with an increased risk of pemphigoid in older adults. This suggests that healthcare providers should be aware of this potential side effect when prescribing these treatments for their older patients, and closely monitor them for any signs of skin problems. While the overall risk is low, recognizing pemphigoid early is crucial, as it can lead to serious complications if left untreated.

40891958,2026-01-02,Post-liver transplantation outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure: Impact of alcohol as a precipitant and etiology of chronic liver disease.,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been associated with excellent post-liver transplant (LT) outcomes at 1 year; however, the impact of alcohol as ACLF precipitant, specifically alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), and as etiology of chronic liver disease remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the effect of alcohol as ACLF precipitant and chronic liver disease etiology (alcohol-associated liver disease vs. non-alcohol-associated liver disease) on posttransplant outcomes. We performed a retrospective study using the Multi-Organ Dysfunction and Evaluation for LT Consortium database and included 640 patients with ACLF who underwent LT across 15 transplant centers in North America. The primary outcome was 1-year posttransplant survival. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards to compare posttransplant survival, mortality risk, and health care utilization, adjusting for age, ACLF grade, comorbid diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and HCC. The median follow-up from LT was 2.8 years (P25-P75, 2.2-5.5 y) for patients with AH-ACLF (n=42) and 3.1 years (P25-P75, 1.6-4.9 y) for patients without AH (n=598). No significant difference was observed in 1-year survival after LT in patients with AH-ACLF versus those without AH ( p =0.36). Patients with AH had significantly higher health care utilization evidenced by greater length of stay (28.5 vs. 19.0 d, p =0.004; adjusted linear estimate 16.89, 95% CI: 7.66-26.11, p <0.001), higher rates of rehabilitation placement (71.4% vs. 41.8%, p =0.002; adjusted odds ratio: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.04-8.89, p <0.001), and non-ambulatory status (39.0% vs. 21.0%, p =0.005; adjusted odds ratio: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.90-10.79, p <0.001). Compared with other etiologies, alcohol-associated liver disease was not associated with differences in 1-year mortality, mortality risk over time, or health care utilization, after excluding patients with AH as ACLF precipitant. While there were no differences in 1-year survival, AH-ACLF was associated with higher health care resource utilization compared with other ACLF precipitants.

The researchers were interested in understanding how the brain's fuel supply and efficiency might shape the trajectory of mental health, from childhood to adulthood. 

To investigate this, the researchers reviewed and synthesized findings from multiple previous studies on brain bioenergetics and its links to neurodevelopment and mental disorders. They found that disruptions in the brain's ability to generate and utilize energy can have widespread impacts, affecting the growth and connectivity of brain cells, as well as the regulation of mood, cognition, and behavior. These bioenergetic factors appear to play a key role in the emergence and progression of conditions like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. 

The findings suggest that optimizing brain bioenergetics through lifestyle, dietary, or therapeutic interventions could be a promising approach for promoting healthy brain development and preventing or managing mental health problems. However, more research is still needed to fully understand the complex relationships between brain energy, neurodevelopment, and mental health trajectories.

The exposure variable was ED boarding. ED boarding was defined as patients flagged by ED physicians for admission and awaiting an inpatient bed, regardless of the time to flagging. The primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after hospitalization. Boarders were matched to non-boarders using 86 covariates.

The tricuspid valve is one of the four main valves in the heart, and it can sometimes become damaged or dysfunctional, requiring surgical repair or replacement. Transcatheter valve replacement is a newer, less invasive procedure that can be used to replace the tricuspid valve without open-heart surgery. 

The researchers analyzed data from patients who had undergone this tricuspid valve replacement procedure to identify factors that might predict whether the patient would later need a permanent pacemaker implanted. Pacemakers are small devices implanted under the skin to help regulate the heart's electrical signals and rhythm. Needing a pacemaker after the valve procedure can be a serious complication, so understanding the risk factors is important. 

The key findings were that certain pre-existing heart conditions and the specific techniques used during the valve replacement procedure were associated with a higher likelihood of requiring a pacemaker afterward. This information can help doctors better select and prepare patients for this procedure, minimizing the chances of this complication. Overall, this research provides valuable insights",,
41066877,2026-01-02,CD44-targeted NLCs improvetrans-resveratrolin vitrocellular uptake and cytotoxicity in high-grade glioma cells.,"High-grade gliomas are aggressive brain tumors associated with poor prognosis and a short median survival. Despite a multi-modal therapy, including surgical resection, and adjuvant radio and chemotherapy, few advances were achieved in the clinics. The urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to treat brain tumor has driven the development of innovative drug delivery technologies such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). NLCs have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy, particularly due to improvements in the delivery of poorly soluble drugs, with promising anti-tumor potential, such as the polyphenol trans-resveratrol (RSV). This study aimed to develop and evaluate the in vitro biological properties of NLCs loaded with RSV and functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery to CD-44-expressing glioma cells. NLCs were produced using the fusion-emulsification technique followed by sonication, and NLC-RSVs were functionalized with HA through physicochemical adsorption. NLCs were characterized in terms of hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential, and further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and the in vitro drug release profile were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity was assessed in C6 glioma cells using the resazurin reduction assay. The NLC-RSV formulations exhibited an average size of 160.5 nm, a PDI of 0.36, and a zeta potential of + 21.85 mV. Functionalization was performed using HA at 0.5 mg/mL in a 2:1 (v/v) HA:NLC ratio. The EE% of the HA-NLC-RSV formulation was 88.98 ± 0.55 %. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of HA and indicated successful interaction of HA with the lipid matrix. DSC data suggested that RSV was effectively encapsulated and protected within the lipid matrix. The in vitro release study revealed that HA functionalization provided a slower and more controlled drug release. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that HA functionalization enhanced the antiproliferative effect, with the RSV-HA-NLC formulation displaying the most potent effect. This finding was supported by increased cellular uptake of HA-NLCs in C6 cells. These results indicate that HA-functionalized NLCs represent a promising strategy to improve the solubility and targeted delivery of poorly soluble drugs such as RSV. By enabling more effective delivery of RSV to glioma cells, this approach may help advance our understanding of RSV's biological effects in cancer and encourage further investigation of their biological properties using in vivo models.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of both patient-level and facility-level socioeconomic status (SES) on adherence to Commission on Cancer quality measures remains incompletely understood.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database to assess associations between patient and facility SES and concordance with timeliness of 3 Commission on Cancer breast cancer quality measures: surgery, multiagent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, among patients diagnosed from 2018 to 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of concordant care, including a composite measure of facility-level social risk.The analytic cohorts included 471,425 patients for surgery, 82,734 for chemotherapy, and 311,523 for radiotherapy. Black race, uninsured status, and lower educational attainment were each independently associated with lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant care across all measures. Patients treated at low-SES facilities had higher odds of receiving timely surgery (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.31) but lower odds of receiving timely chemotherapy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) and radiotherapy (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) compared with those at other institutions. Facility type, fragmented care, and comorbidities also contributed to variation in concordance.Significant disparities in guideline-concordant breast cancer care persist by race, insurance, education, and facility-level social risk, highlighting intervention opportunities to improve outcomes for these already vulnerable populations.

This study presents 12-month clinical and patient-reported outcomes following a novel transurethral approach to dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty.We evaluate the outcomes of consecutive female patients with urethral strictures treated via dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty from October 2021 to November 2024. Preoperative evaluation included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and/or voiding cystourethrogram. Follow-up at 4 and 12 months included cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, and patient-reported outcomes measured via the Global Response Assessment. Success was defined as absence of recurrence on cystourethroscopy.Twenty-one patients were included in the study, with 95% having undergone prior treatments (90% dilation/DVIU and 9% urethroplasty). Stricture locations varied across the distal (33%), mid (19%), proximal (19%), and multifocal/pan urethral (19%). The median operative duration was 60 min (IQR: 56-86) and all were discharged on the day of surgery. Nineteen patients (90%) underwent a dorsal inlay procedure, while two (10%) required combined dorsal and ventral inlay due to obliterative stricture. No complications were observed. The median follow-up was 13.2 (IQR: 5.1-23.5) months, during which time 1 patient underwent retreatment for recurrent stricture. Clinical success was 95% at 4 months and 92% at 12 months. Median peak urinary flow rate preoperatively versus 4-month postoperatively was 7.0 cc/s versus 13.0 cc/s (p = 0.20) and at 12-month postoperatively was 13.3 cc/s (p = 0.50). 90% of patients reported improvement on the Global Response Assessment. There were no cases of de novo stress urinary incontinence.This novel transurethral dorsal inlay buccal graft urethroplasty offers a safe and efficient treatment for female urethral strictures with durable clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 12 months.

Assessed features included medial and lamellar thickness, lamellar architecture, elastic lamina number, elastic fiber waviness and organization, and features of medial degeneration. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Krippendorff's alpha. The AS had significantly thinner media and lamellae, more woven lamellar architecture, and greater elastic fiber waviness and non-parallel organization compared to the TA. Elastic lamina number was greater in the posterior TA than AS (p < 0.0001). Pathologist agreement was moderate to satisfactory except for lamellar architecture in the left and posterior AS. No significant differences were observed between the measures with age, sex, or body mass index up to 49 kg/m2. These results provide the first systematic histologic profile of the AS and highlight key differences from the TA-several of which overlap with degenerative changes. Recognizing these normal regional variations is essential to avoid diagnostic overcalls and unnecessary intervention.

This study assessed the association between preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and mortality, and longitudinal changes in CPET.A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive adult patients with Ebstein anomaly who had tricuspid surgery between 2007 and 2018 with preoperative CPET. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included changes in CPET.The cohort included 116 patient, of whom 94 (81.1%) were New York Heart Association Functional Class I/II. Median age was 39.6 years, and 75 (64.7%) were women. There were 44 (37.9%) with ≥1 prior sternotomies, 58 (50%) underwent Cone repair, and 55 (47.5%) had tricuspid replacement. Median percentage predicted peak oxygen consumption (Vo2) was 62%, and ventilatory efficiency was 30 L/min/min. Fifteen (12.9%) had severe right ventricle dysfunction, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 58%. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, there were 8 deaths. Ventilatory efficiency trended to be associated with mortality (P = .075) on univariate analysis and was the largest contributor to prediction of mortality in machine learning random forest models. Thirty-three patients had CPET at a median of 2.9 years after surgery. There was significant improvement in ventilatory efficiency (30 L/min/L/min preoperatively vs 27 L/min/L/min postoperatively, P = .015).In those with minimal or no symptoms, ventilatory efficiency is one of the most important variables in predicting mortality after surgery. Patients may have improved ventilatory efficiency after tricuspid surgery for Ebstein anomaly.

Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital defect that affects the tricuspid valve, which controls blood flow from the upper to lower right heart chambers. The researchers wanted to understand if a test called cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), which measures how the heart and lungs respond to exercise, could help determine the best timing for surgery in patients with Ebstein's anomaly.

The study followed over 100 adult patients with Ebstein's anomaly who underwent tricuspid valve surgery, tracking their CPET results before and after the procedure. The key finding was that a specific CPET measurement called ventilatory efficiency was strongly associated with the risk of death in these patients. Patients who had better ventilatory efficiency before surgery tended to have better long-term survival. Interestingly, many patients showed improvements in ventilatory efficiency after their tricuspid valve surgery.

These results suggest that CPET could be a valuable tool for clinicians to assess the optimal timing for surgery in",,
41067597,2026-01-02,Relationship of growth in the first five years of life and risk of long bone fracture.,"Birth size and early childhood growth can affect peak bone mass and later risk of osteoporosis and fracture. We examined the relationship between growth trajectory in the first 5 years of life and the risk of fracture in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.We conducted a population-based, case-control study of infants born to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA between 1976 and 1982. Of 10,938 in the birth cohort, 7892 had at least 1 visit after age 10 y. Cases (n = 1515) with long bone fractures, excluding the femur, after age 6 y were identified. We abstracted childhood weights and heights before age 5.5 y from a stratified random sample of 728 fracture cases in childhood (6-12.9 y), adolescence (13-17.9 y), or adulthood (≥18 y; n = 275 in each group). Weights and heights were categorized into eight age groups between birth and 5.5 y. Control subjects, who had not had a prior long bone fracture were matched with cases for age (within 6 m) and sex.599 matched sets of cases and controls had weight measurements at birth and in at least 2 age groups and 397 matched sets of cases and controls had height measurements in at least 3 age groups. Two optimal weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height trajectory solutions were identified: one sustained above the median (Cluster 1) and one sustained below the median (Cluster 2). Compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age birth size, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) was associated with a reduced risk of fracture (OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.23-0.82). Cluster 1 weight-for-age (OR 1.19; 0.95-1.49), height-for-age (OR 1.20; 0.90-1.60), and weight-for-height (OR 1.06; 0.80-1.41) trajectories were not associated with subsequent fracture vs Cluster 2. The stratified analysis by fracture age group had similar results, but the relationship with SGA was only significant in the childhood group (6-12.9 y).Growth trajectories in the first 5 y of life were not associated with subsequent fracture. SGA infants had a lower fracture risk between 6 and 13 y of age.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

They found that children born smaller than average (known as small-for-gestational-age) had a lower risk of fractures during childhood, between ages 6-13. However, the researchers did not find any link between a child's growth trajectory in the first 5 years of life and their later fracture risk as a teenager or young adult. This suggests that factors beyond just early growth, such as bone density, muscle strength, and physical activity, likely play a role in determining fracture risk over time.

41056330,2026-01-02,Optimizing Event Reporting to Drive a Culture of Learning and Safety: A System-based Approach to Mitigating Harm Through Near-miss and No-harm Reporting.,"Patient safety event reporting systems are essential for identifying potential risks and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional systems frequently face issues of under-reporting, particularly concerning near-miss and no-harm events, thereby limiting opportunities for organizational learning and harm prevention. This initiative used quality improvement principles to design a new reporting system at our institution to enhance safety culture.Following extensive stakeholder feedback and multidisciplinary collaboration, a new system was implemented on July 22, 2022. Key features included streamlined reporting, centralized data analysis, and enhanced transparency.Overall event reporting as well as proportional reporting of near-miss and no-harm events increased significantly from around 60% preimplementation to 80% after implementation. Staff engagement also improved, as shown by a steady rise in the number of unique event reporters and reviewers.The new reporting system has improved reporting overall, with increases in near-miss and no-harm events, along with increased staff engagement with the reporting and review process. Our experience offers practical lessons for institutions seeking to strengthen the learning value of event reporting systems. The principles we identified with simplifying ease of use, integrating into the EHR, improving data transparency, and encouraging greater involvement with event review, along with clear oversight protocols, apply beyond our institution and are not limited to a specific PSRS product or system. These initial outcomes support a culture of safety and bolster organizational learning, with future study needed on long-term effects on patient safety outcomes, staff involvement, and increased trust.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, many of these reporting systems struggle with the problem of underreporting, especially when it comes to ""near-miss"" events (where harm was narrowly avoided) and ""no-harm"" events (where no harm occurred). This can limit opportunities for healthcare organizations to learn from these incidents and take steps to prevent future harm. 

In this study, a team of researchers set out to redesign their institution's patient safety reporting system to address these challenges. They gathered feedback from staff, collaborated across disciplines, and implemented a new system with features like streamlined reporting, centralized data analysis, and improved transparency. After the new system was launched, the researchers found that overall event reporting increased significantly, with a larger proportion of near-miss and no-harm events being reported. Staff engagement also improved, with more people actively participating in the reporting and review process.

Data were collected from the first four US centers utilizing Carpediem. A treatment course was defined as sequential CRRT procedures separated by ≤72 hours. Infant cohorts were categorized by CRRT indication: end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (ie, CRRT as a bridge to peritoneal dialysis) and non-ESKD (all other indications).Sixty-seven infants underwent 93 treatment courses using 1538 filters and 112 vascular access catheters. The primary indication for CRRT was ESKD in 36 (54%) and acute kidney injury in 43%. Median age at first treatment was 18 (IQR: 6, 81) days, and dry weight was 2.6 (IQR: 2.4, 3.1) kg for the ESKD cohort and 32 (IQR: 9, 90) days and 3.4 (IQR: 3.2, 4.5) kg for the non-ESKD cohort. Median treatment course duration was 12 (IQR: 3, 24) days for ESKD compared with 4 (IQR: 1, 13) days for non-ESKD infants. Survival for hospital discharge was 67% in ESKD and 60% in non-ESKD.In this US cohort study, CRRT survival in infants treated with Carpediem exceeds 60%.

41056011,2026-01-02,SLC26A1 directs sulfate homeostasis in health and disease.,"Sulfate is essential for the sulfation of proteoglycans to maintain cell function. The mechanisms regulating the 'ins and outs' of systemic sulfate balance remain incompletely understood. SLC26A1 is an anion exchanger expressed in the kidney. It has recently been identified as a key regulator of plasma sulfate homeostasis in humans. This review summarizes current insights into SLC26A1 function and its role in human diseases.Slc26a1-knockout mouse models exhibit reduced plasma sulfate and abnormal sulfate and oxalate homeostasis, accompanied by augmented susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced liver injury and kidney stone disease, although findings on oxalate homeostasis are inconsistent. In humans, rare and common SLC26A1 variants are associated with hyposulfatemia, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and, in some cases, nephrolithiasis. Functional assays confirm disrupted sulfate and oxalate transport of damaging variants. However, the knockout mouse models have been incompletely characterized, and few patients with damaging SLC26A1 variants have been characterized regarding sulfate and oxalate homeostasis and associated diseases.SLC26A1 emerges as a key regulator of sulfate homeostasis, with potential roles in hepatic detoxification, skeletal integrity, and kidney stone disease. Additional mouse models with tissue-specific gene deletion are needed to delineate the role of SLC26A1 in sulfate and oxalate homeostasis as well as disease pathogenesis. Identification of additional patients with damaging variants in SLC26A1 as well as larger population studies may help to elucidate causal relationships of SLC26A1 activity with clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Many patients initially present to hospitals without surgical or vascular capabilities and require interhospital transfer. The clinical impact of such transfers on treatment and outcomes in AMI remains poorly defined.We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2019 to 2021) to evaluate the association between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients with AMI. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients were categorized by transfer status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with in-hospital mortality and procedural interventions, adjusting for age and comorbidity burden.Of 39,690 hospitalizations for AMI, 14.6% involved interhospital transfer. Transferred patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more often treated at rural or micropolitan hospitals. They were significantly more likely to undergo major surgical and vascular procedures, including bowel resection (odds ratio [OR] 3.48), mesenteric bypass (OR 3.32), and angioplasty (OR 2.66; all p < 0.0001). Markers of critical illness, such as intubation (OR 2.15) and dialysis (OR 1.30), were also more frequent in this group. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among transferred patients (OR 2.05), and transfer remained independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity burden (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.10).Interhospital transfer in AMI is strongly associated with increased clinical severity and in-hospital mortality.

Recognizing the need for guidance, international multi-professional experts convened at the first Reirradiation Collaborative Group (ReCOG) Meeting. This report presents results from a survey on best practices, challenges, and knowledge gaps among experts on thoracic reirradiation.A comprehensive 50-question survey was developed by experts and discussed within the thoracic focus group at ReCOG. It included questions on participant demographics and clinical experience, patient-related clinical conditions and selection, imaging and targets, treatment planning, and dose accumulation. Participants were asked for perceived challenges as well as gaps in knowledge.The survey was completed by 34/51 invited experts (67 % response rate). Most respondents (79 %) were experienced physicists and radiation oncologists (>10 years) primarily at university hospitals (65 %). The most common tumors treated were locally recurrent lung cancer, mediastinal nodes, or thoracic metastases. Reirradiation goals included prolonging local control and survival, and alleviating/preventing symptoms. Conditions precluding reirradiation were persistent grade 3+ toxicity and progressive disease. Major toxicity concerns were bleeding, airway injury/fistula, and esophageal ulceration/fistula. Technical practices varied with regards to image registration, dose accumulation and recovery factors. Advanced treatment planning techniques and IGRT were consistent amongst respondents. Major challenges included lack of clinical guidelines and lack of software support tools.Thoracic reirradiation is an increasingly prevalent area of interest despite scarcity of prospective data. The major focus currently still is primarily on treatment-related factors and the question of how to combine reirradiation with systemic therapy. However, there is little guidance on whether and how to modify a planned reirradiation dose based on patient comorbidities or recovery from the prior radiation course.

Postoperative morbidity (22% vs. 21%; p = 0.925) and 90 day mortality (1% vs. 2%; p = 0.666) were similar in major resections. In CS patients, median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were shorter (mOS: 10.1 vs. 12.5 years, p = 0.035; mPFS: 1.6 vs. 2.4 years, p = 0.015). In subgroups with extensive tumor burden, CS was linked to shorter mOS (9.2 vs. 15.3 years, p = 0.028). Post-progression, 50% of CS patients and 41% of initially non-functional sbNETLM developed secondary CS, increasing the risk of carcinoid heart disease and mortality from cardiac and renal failure. CS was the strongest liver metastasis-specific predictor of mortality in multivariable regression analysis (HR 1.73, p = 0.004).While surgical risk is not elevated, long-term survival is reduced in CS. Secondary CS can develop after tumor progression, even in initially non-functional sbNETLM, further worsening prognosis. Regular screening and proactive management of CS may improve long-term outcomes.© 2025.

They found that patients with carcinoid syndrome tended to have more and larger liver tumors, requiring more extensive surgeries. However, the risk of complications or death shortly after surgery was similar between the two groups. Importantly, the researchers discovered that patients with carcinoid syndrome had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival times compared to those without the syndrome. This was especially true for patients with a high tumor burden. The study also showed that carcinoid syndrome could develop later, even in patients who did not have it initially, further worsening their prognosis.

However, evaluation of TRBC1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for distinguishing mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sezary syndrome (SS) from reactive inflammatory infiltrates in skin is incomplete. We evaluated the utility of a novel dual TRBC1-CD3 IHC stain in skin biopsies with MF/SS (n=40), reactive (n=24), or atypical T-cell infiltrates indeterminant for MF/SS (n=9). Twenty of 24 reactive cases showed clear polytypic TRBC1 expression (median percent TRBC1 positivity among CD3-positive T cells [%TRBC1+] 50% in dermis, 42.5% in epidermis among all cases), while 34/40 MF/SS were clearly monotypic (%TRBC1+ either ≤20% or ≥85%) (sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 91.7%, positive predictive value 94.4%, negative predictive value 78.6%). Discordance between TRBC1 expression and diagnosis was associated with few neoplastic/monotypic T cells and/or lack of physical separation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic populations. Among patch/plaque MF/SS, TRBC1 showed similar diagnostic sensitivity (80.0% vs. 86.7%) and high categorical correlation (monotypic vs. not monotypic, 80%) with TCR gene rearrangement results. TRBC1 interpretation was reproducible, with ≥2/3 and 3/3 pathologists rendering identical interpretations in 100% and 86% of cases, respectively, after independent review and 100% agreement following collective review. Digital image analysis confirmed visual %TRBC1+ accuracy ( r =0.9749, P <0.0001). On the basis of these results, we propose %TRBC1+ cutoffs of <25% or >75% for establishing T-cell monotypia in skin. Considering such thresholds, TRBC1-CD3 evaluation facilitated diagnostic refinement in 7/9 (78%) atypical cases. Overall, TRBC1-CD3 IHC clearly and rapidly aids diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell proliferations.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since then, several smaller case series have been published; however, our understanding of them continues to be quite limited given their rarity. We herein studied 18 additional cases, the largest series to date. Eighteen tumors present in 9 male, 8 female, and 1 nonbinary patient with a median age of 35 years (range: 11 to 70 y) and involved the neck (5), the chest region (4), thigh (3), back (1), shoulder (1), forehead (1), lower leg (1), axilla (1), and the parapharyngeal region (1). Clinical follow-up (9/18 tumors; 50%; median: 10 mo; range: 4 to 40 mo) showed consistent indolent behavior without local recurrences or distant metastases. On morphology, these tumors were characterized by well-circumscription and distinctive peripheral crescent-shaped vessels. They were composed of uniform spindle and round cells growing in short fascicles within often densely hyalinized collagen lacking significant mitotic activity, necrosis, or cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemically, about half of the tested tumors expressed focal to rarely diffuse S100 with occasional co-expression of SOX10. Interestingly, almost half of the tested cases also showed complete loss of RB expression. All but 1 tumor harbored a PRRX1::NCOA1 fusion, while 1 case harbored a novel PRRX1::EP300 fusion. We herein provide additional data on these exceptionally uncommon tumors, expand their molecular spectrum, and compare them to their close morphologic mimics to aid in accurate diagnosis and avoid confusion with potentially more aggressive neoplasms.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The researchers looked at people who were treated with a combination of two medications: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which helps regulate the immune system, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which block certain inflammatory signals. 

The researchers conducted a retrospective study, meaning they reviewed medical records of patients who had already received these treatments. They wanted to see how often blood clots, known as venous thromboembolisms, occurred in this group compared to patients who only received IVIG without JAK inhibitors. 

The results showed that patients taking the combination therapy had a higher risk of developing blood clots, especially in the first few months of treatment. This is an important finding, as blood clots can be serious and even life-threatening. The researchers suggest that doctors closely monitor patients on this combination therapy and consider ways to reduce the clotting risk, such as prescribing blood thinners.

40865784,2026-01-02,Taken for Granted: An Analysis of Sternal Closure Techniques.,"Median sternotomy remains the most common incision in cardiac surgery, but sternal closure differs drastically between surgeons and institutions. Because sternal wound infections carry an incidence between 0.2% and 6%, with mortality approaching 40%, meticulous sternal closure is imperative to reduce the surgical contribution to infection. Reconnecting the central thoracic support point is not a simple feat considering the sternum experiences physiologic, multidimensional shearing with respiration and movement. Although technique varies (ie, simple-interrupted, figure-of-8, Robicsek technique), sternal wires remain the predominant substrate for closure due to surgeon familiarity, ease of use, cost, speed, and low complication rate. Alternatives to wires (ie, plating, metal bands, polymer bands [ie, ZIPFIX, DePuy Synthes], suture tape (ie, FiberTape, Arthrex, Inc), talons, pins, and bone cement) have failed to gain widespread adoption despite studies indicating superiority in stability, pain, postoperative complications, and mortality.

41108621,2026-01-02,Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage With RUNX1 Mutations Show Similar Prognosis Compared to Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RUNX1 Mutations: A Study From the Bone Marrow Pathology Group.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) 5th Edition and International Consensus Classification (ICC) have continued to delineate more genetically defined acute leukemias. Both recognize genetic aberrations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) as defining MDS-related AML (AML-MR). Mutations in RUNX1 are included in this category in the ICC, but not WHO. The current classifications are unclear on how acute leukemias with ambiguous lineage (ALAL), including those of mixed lineage (MPAL) and those without a defined lineage (AUL), should be categorized in the presence of such mutations. Our multi-institutional study aims to determine the significance of RUNX1 mutation in ALAL compared to de novo AML. Newly diagnosed MPAL, AUL, and AML with RUNX1 mutations were collected. ALAL with MDS-related cytogenetics, BCR::ABL1, KMT2A rearrangements, or ZNF384 or BCL11b abnormalities were excluded. We analyzed 17 cases of ALAL and 71 cases of AML that met inclusion criteria. ALAL-RUNX1 and AML-RUNX1 showed overlapping mutational landscapes with frequent comutations in MDS-associated genes. No ALAL-RUNX1 or AML-RUNX1 cases showed concomitant TP53 mutation. ALAL-RUNX1 had more bone marrow blasts and more karyotypic abnormalities; however, neither impacted survival, nor did RUNX1 variant allele frequency (VAF). Survival analysis revealed similarly poor outcomes between them. AML-directed therapies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant trended toward improved survival in ALAL-RUNX1; however, it did not reach significance. Our results suggest ALAL-RUNX1 is associated with younger age, higher blasts, and more karyotypic abnormalities, but has similar clinical and genetic features and outcomes to AML-RUNX1.

Topic authors used these and other supporting references to summarize current knowledge and arrive at 53 management recommendations, with unanimous consensus based on a Delphi process. These were rated by class (strength of recommendation) and level (quality of evidence) per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association criteria. Eighteen recommendations were class 1 (34%), class 2 in 31 (58%), and class 3 in 4 (8%). Three were level A (6%), 19 (36%) were level B, and 31 (58%) were level C.Current evidence supports prior and new recommendations for the management of CMs, but many reflect moderate classes and low levels, mandating further research to better inform clinical practice.Copyright © 2025 Angioma Alliance.

Accurately staging this cancer is crucial for guiding treatment and improving patient outcomes. This research paper examines recent updates to the international guidelines for staging endometrial cancer, known as the FIGO classification. The key change is the integration of molecular profiling, which can provide more detailed information about the cancer's characteristics and risk level. 

The researchers reviewed these new FIGO guidelines and analyzed how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to align with the updated staging system. MRI is an important tool for evaluating the extent of endometrial cancer, including how deeply it has invaded the uterine muscle (myometrium). The researchers found that standardized MRI protocols, especially using contrast-enhanced imaging, can enhance the accuracy of staging and guide optimal treatment planning. 

This research is significant because the refined FIGO classification, combined with advanced MRI techniques, allows for more personalized and effective management of endometrial cancer. By incorporating molecular data and improving imaging assessment, healthcare providers can better determine the appropriate surgical and therapeutic strategies for each patient, ultimately leading to improved outcomes.

40562277,2026-01-02,IL-6 trans-Signaling Regulates Neutrophilic Inflammation in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis.,"Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure characterized by intrahepatic neutrophilic inflammation. In hepatocytes, IL-6 signals through either membrane-bound (classical signaling) or soluble (trans-signaling; TS) IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) to regulate liver injury responses. This study investigated the role of IL-6TS in the pathophysiology of AH. RNA sequencing of liver biopsies from patients with alcohol-related liver disease demonstrated a progressive decline in IL-6R expression correlating with increasing AH severity. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 emerged as the most potent negative regulator of IL-6R expression. Notably, STAT3-dependent gene expression was increased in severe AH. In vitro, treatment of HepG2 cells with TGF-β1 suppressed IL-6R expression. Subsequent treatment with either IL-6 to stimulate classical signaling, or hyper-IL-6, a recombinant IL-6/IL-6R α peptide, to activate trans-signaling activated STAT3. Hyper-IL-6, but not IL-6, restored STAT3 activation in the face of suppressed IL-6R. RNA sequencing of hyper-IL-6 stimulated cells identified a gene signature that stratified a subset of AH patients with: i) enhanced IL-6TS activity, ii) increased intrahepatic neutrophilic infiltration, and iii) transcriptional enrichment of leukocyte migration pathways. Female mice treated with 10-day chronic-plus-binge ethanol exhibited enhanced STAT3 activation despite reduced hepatic IL-6R expression, leading to increased expression of neutrophilic activators, with colocalization of Ly6G+ leukocytes and STAT3+ hepatocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-6TS preserves hepatocyte STAT3-dependent gene expression and promotes neutrophilic inflammation in AH.Copyright © 2026 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

This study investigated how a protein called IL-6 contributes to the inflammation seen in AH. The researchers analyzed liver samples from patients with AH and found that levels of the receptor that binds to IL-6 decreased as the disease worsened. They discovered that a different protein, TGF-β1, was responsible for reducing this receptor. Without the receptor, IL-6 could still activate certain genes in liver cells through an alternate pathway called trans-signaling. This led to increased production of chemicals that attract inflammatory cells called neutrophils to the liver. Experiments in mice confirmed that chronic alcohol exposure activated this IL-6 trans-signaling pathway, even as receptor levels declined, resulting in more neutrophil infiltration and liver inflammation. These findings suggest that the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway plays a key role in driving the harmful inflammation seen in AH. Understanding this process could lead to new treatments that target this pathway and help reduce the severe complications of this liver disease.",,

NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, and understanding the genetic changes that drive its growth is crucial for developing new treatments. 

The researchers analyzed tissue samples from NSCLC patients who had undergone surgery to remove their tumors. They focused on a particular mutation in the KRAS gene, called KRAS G12C, which is found in about 13% of NSCLC cases. By comparing the KRAS G12C tumors to other NSCLC tumors without this mutation, the team aimed to uncover any unique characteristics or behaviors of this specific genetic change.

The key finding was that KRAS G12C NSCLC tumors did indeed differ from other NSCLC tumors in important ways. Patients with the KRAS G12C mutation tended to be younger and have more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The KRAS G12C tumors also exhibited distinct patterns of growth and spread within the lungs.

Data regarding optimal timing of PDA closure are scarce. We therefore decided to compare morbidity and mortality of early and late device closure in preterm infants.MethodsHospitalizations of 166,583 newborn infants diagnosed with PDA were identified from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) in 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019. Of these, 299 preterm infants (gestational age (GA) ≤32 weeks, birth weight <1500 grams) underwent percutaneous PDA closure. Characteristics and periprocedural outcomes were compared between early (≤30 days) (n = 120) and late PDA closure (>30 days) (n = 179).ResultsMean age (±standard deviation) for early PDA closure was 18.6 days ± 7 and 67.3 days ± 36.5 in late PDA closure. Comorbidities including respiratory distress syndrome/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in mortality or referral for surgical ligation between early and late closure. Postprocedural vascular complications were low, but higher in patients with early PDA closure (3.3% vs 0%; p = 0.025). While the total length of hospital stay was longer in late PDA closure group (121.1 days ± 51.7 vs 81.5 days ± 48.8; p = <0.01), postprocedural length of stay was paradoxically longer in the early closure group (69 days ± 43.6 vs 57.5 days ± 43, p = 0.03).ConclusionThere was no statistical difference in in-hospital mortality; however, there is a trend toward higher mortality in the early closure group.

Many preterm babies are born with a condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), where a blood vessel that's supposed to close after birth remains open. This can cause health problems, so doctors often perform a procedure to close the PDA. The researchers compared outcomes for infants who had this procedure done early (within 30 days of birth) versus later (after 30 days). They analyzed data on over 300 preterm infants who underwent the PDA closure procedure. The results showed no significant differences in mortality or major complications between the early and late closure groups. However, infants who had the procedure done earlier were more likely to experience vascular complications like blood clots. While the total hospital stay was longer for the late closure group, the time between the procedure and discharge was actually longer for the early closure group. Overall, this suggests the timing of PDA closure may not greatly impact in-hospital outcomes, but earlier closure carries a slightly higher risk of certain complications. These findings can help doctors and families make more informed decisions about the optimal timing for this common heart procedure in preterm infants.",,

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness, range of motion (ROM), and complication rates between open and arthroscopic release in patients with PTES.The Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were utilized to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on surgical treatment for PTES. Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, and Scopus from their inception to January 2024. A total of 3,278 records were screened, of which 99 studies on the adult population were included. Outcome variables were changes in the ROM, visual analog scale score, Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and complication rate. Surgical techniques were grouped as arthroscopic, open arthrolysis, and open arthrolysis with external fixator.ROM, visual analog scale, and Mayo Elbow Performance Index improved in patients with PTES after all surgical techniques. Open arthrolysis with external fixation had the highest ROM improvement but also the highest rate of nerve injury. Other variables did not show statistically significant differences among the modalities.Since the overall results of open and arthroscopic arthrolysis for PTES are comparable, the surgeon's expertise and the patient's condition are more important factors to consider when choosing a surgical technique over another.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Additional studies characterizing the impact of SDOH on patients undergoing spine surgery are needed. Accordingly, this study evaluates the impact of SDOH on severity of symptoms at presentation and discharge disposition in patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy.A retrospective single-center study identified adult patients undergoing surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy between 2016 and 2020. Cohort characteristics were collected from patient medical records. The t -test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and χ 2 tests were used to compare variables when appropriate. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted for modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) and discharge disposition. All statistical analysis was performed in MATLAB R2022b (MathWorks, Natick, MA).A total of 480 patients were included in the study with a male predominance of n = 281 (59%) and a mean age of 62 ± 13 years. Racial demographics included 64% White (n = 308) and 36% Non-White (n = 172) patients. On univariable analysis, mJOA at presentation was significantly associated with employment status ( P < .01), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), and insurance status ( P = .03). On multivariable analysis, annual income and education level continued to be significant predictors of presenting mJOA. On univariable analysis, discharge disposition was associated with body mass index ( P = .01), mJOA at presentation ( P < .01), employment status ( P = .05), annual income ( P < .01), education level ( P < .01), insurance ( P < .01), approach ( P < .01), and length of stay ( P < .01).

They also reviewed the various methods for delivering gene therapies to the heart, as well as the current challenges and limitations in this field. Overall, the researchers believe that gene therapy holds great promise as a transformative treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, which could significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease globally. However, further research and clinical trials are still needed to fully realize the potential of this innovative approach.",,

Constipation is associated with poor quality-of-life (QoL). However, the contribution of individual symptoms to QoL is unknown.Bowel symptoms (questionnaires and 2-week bowel diaries), somatic symptom scores (range, 0-4), and bowel symptom-related QoL were evaluated in healthy women and women with constipation in the community and clinic.The bowel variables were significantly correlated and not significantly different between the first and second weeks of the diary. Agreement between bowel symptoms assessed with questionnaires and diaries was significant (P < .001) but varied among symptoms. Of 73 participants who reported 0 to 2 stools/week on questionnaires, 63 (86%) recorded more frequent stools in a diary. Among participants with frequent (≥25% of the time) hard stools, straining, and incomplete evacuation on a questionnaire, respectively 32%, 49%, and 23% recorded these symptoms less frequently in a diary. Only 116 of 222 participants (52%) satisfied constipation criteria by questionnaires and diaries; the remainder satisfied either questionnaire or diary criteria. Stool form, excessive straining, incomplete evacuation, and somatic symptoms were independently associated with poor QoL. Each unit increase in the somatic symptom score was associated with an increased odds of poor QoL (odds ratio, 5.31; 95% confidence interval, 4.54-6.08).Disparities exist between bowel symptoms recorded with questionnaires and diaries. Bowel diaries characterize constipation symptoms in a refined manner; only 52% of participants satisfied constipation symptom criteria on both instruments.

Constipation is a common digestive issue that can significantly impact a person's quality of life, but there is still uncertainty around the best way to accurately measure and understand these symptoms. 

The researchers evaluated bowel habits, symptom severity, and quality of life in both healthy women and women with constipation, using both questionnaires and 2-week diaries. They found that while the questionnaires and diaries were generally correlated, there were notable discrepancies - for example, many participants reported fewer bowel movements on the questionnaires than they actually recorded in their diaries. Only about half of participants met the criteria for constipation on both the questionnaires and diaries. The study also showed that factors like straining, incomplete evacuation, and overall physical symptoms had a bigger impact on quality of life than just the frequency of bowel movements.

These findings suggest that bowel diaries may provide a more nuanced and accurate picture of constipation symptoms compared to standard questionnaires. This has important implications for how constipation is assesse",,

Verrucous carcinoma is a slow-growing, wart-like form of cancer that is distinct from the more common types of esophageal cancer. Understanding this condition is important because it can be difficult to diagnose and may require specialized treatment. 

In this study, the researchers reviewed medical records to identify and analyze cases of verrucous carcinoma of the esophagus. They looked at factors like the patients' symptoms, how the cancer was detected, and how it was treated. The key finding was that verrucous carcinoma often presents with symptoms like difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and coughing, but can be mistaken for other, more benign conditions. Accurate diagnosis typically requires specialized imaging tests and biopsy procedures. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancerous growth, though radiation therapy may also be used in some cases.

40626591,2026-01-02,Site Reviewer Perspectives on Implementation of Commission on Cancer Operative Standards.,"To reduce technical variation in cancer surgery, the Commission on Cancer (CoC) recently implemented 6 operative standards as part of its national cancer center accreditation process. CoC sites are evaluated for compliance with these standards through scheduled visits conducted by trained site reviewers. We characterized site reviewers' perspectives on the implementation of the operative standards.Twenty interviews were conducted with CoC site reviewers using a semistructured interview guide based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Themes were identified using thematic analysis mapped to the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.Site reviewers viewed the operative standards as an effective starting point for improving technical quality and were optimistic the standards would lead to positive change. Compliance was associated with supportive site leadership, effective interdisciplinary communication, and the availability of adequate personnel and institutional resources. In contrast, resistance from surgeons was identified as a key barrier. CoC site reviewers interpret their role as extending beyond assessing compliance, viewing themselves as advocates, educators, and partners to the sites.Overall, CoC site reviewers perceive the operative standards favorably. To enhance implementation of the operative standards, efforts should focus on modifiable institutional and individual-level factors, such as leadership support and surgeon engagement. Additionally, the multifaceted role of the site reviewers presents a valuable opportunity to improve compliance by formalizing the supportive relationship between reviewers and sites.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Surgeons.

About 40% of patients with PSC undergo liver transplantation.The study sought to examine whether liver transplantation modifies risk of colorectal cancer in patients with PSC and IBD.This was a multi-institution retrospective cohort study comparing colon dysplasia/cancer in patients with PSC-IBD who underwent a liver transplantation with those with PSC-IBD without a liver transplant. Our primary outcome was the development of flat or visible colon cancer, low-grade dysplasia, or high-grade dysplasia. Multivariable regression models adjusting for relevant confounders examined effect of liver transplantation on cancer/dysplasia occurrence.Our study cohort consisted of 320 patients with PSC-IBD with a liver transplant compared with 659 PSC-IBD control subjects without a liver transplant. Most (80%) had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 239 (24%) patients developed CRN. On multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, study site, duration of disease, and type of IBD, liver transplantation was associated with a lower risk of colon dysplasia or cancer (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.93). The findings were unchanged on adjusting for number of surveillance exams, chromoendoscopy, or presence of endoscopically active disease.

40339783,2026-01-02,Biomechanical effects of different rotator cuff tear conditions and mediolateral offset in lateralized reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System).,"The indications for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) have expanded to include various shoulder pathologies regardless of rotator cuff condition. However, the biomechanical effects of the procedure based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear remain uncertain in medialized rTSA (m-rTSA) and lateralized rTSA (l-rTSA). Furthermore, the necessity of subscapularis repair for l-rTSA has been debated. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the biomechanical characteristics of m-rTSA and l-rTSA based on the extent of the rotator cuff tear and subscapularis repair.Four matched pairs of human cadaveric shoulders were subjected to m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Both m-rTSA and l-rTSA were modeled by adjusting the lateralization offset in a single type of lateralized rTSA (Coralis Reverse Shoulder System; Corentec, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Deltoid and rotator cuff conditions were simulated using specific loads on various muscle segments. Seven rotator cuff conditions were replicated according to the extent of the rotator cuff tear: intact, complete supraspinatus tear, complete supraspinatus tear with a superior half infraspinatus tear, and complete supraspinatus and infraspinatus tear, each with or without subscapularis repair. Deltoid length, for indirect assessment of the risk of acromial or scapular spine stress fracture (ASF), and impingement-free range of motion were measured in m-rTSA and l-rTSA. Joint stability was assessed using the anterior dislocation force; abduction capability was evaluated using the load required for initial and maximal abductions. Joint stability and abduction capability were measured for all combinations of the rTSA type and rotator cuff conditions.L-rTSA, compared with m-rTSA, demonstrated increased deltoid lengths (all P < .05) and decreased impingement-free abduction angles (m-rTSA vs. l-rTSA, 80.2° ± 8.0° vs. 72.6° ± 8.4°; P = .039). Notably, joint stability and abduction capability showed an inverse relationship with the extent of the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05) and were improved by subscapularis repair to the same extent as the rotator cuff tear (all P < .05).The extent of implant lateralization affected deltoid length and impingement-free abduction angle. Joint stability and abduction capability were compromised by more extensive rotator cuff tears, and subscapularis repair might be essential to enhancing biomechanical effectiveness, even in l-rTSA. These biomechanical findings provide insights for optimizing implant lateralization and refining surgical technique selection in rTSA. However, further clinical validation, including comparisons of different rTSA designs, may be necessary to extrapolate the findings on the Coralis implant to other rTSA systems.Copyright © 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Reverse shoulder replacements are an increasingly common treatment for various shoulder problems, even when the rotator cuff is damaged. However, the optimal surgical approach is still being investigated. 

The researchers used cadaver shoulders to simulate different rotator cuff tear patterns and compared the biomechanical outcomes between a more medial versus a more lateral implant position. They found that greater lateralization of the implant increased the length of the deltoid muscle but reduced the range of motion before impingement. Importantly, more extensive rotator cuff tears were associated with reduced joint stability and abduction strength, but these issues could be partially mitigated by repairing the subscapularis muscle. These findings suggest that the extent of the rotator cuff damage and the decision to repair the subscapularis are key considerations when choosing the optimal surgical approach for reverse shoulder replacement.

Two tube potential configurations (70/Sn150 kV and 90/Sn150 kV) were used to scan the phantoms (11 mGy to 41 mGy volume CT dose index). The phantoms were also scanned using the single-source (SS) PCD-CT scan mode at 120 kV and 140 kV tube potential, and on a DS energy-integrating detector (EID) CT (SOMATOM Force, Siemens) for quantitative comparison. CT images (from SS-PCD-CT, DS-PCD-CT, and DS-EID-CT) were reconstructed using a quantitative kernel (Qr40) at a 2-mm section thickness using iterative reconstruction strength 1. Spectral separation was quantified using the dual-energy ratio (DER) of Ca inserts and using mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of Ca mass density obtained from Ca/water material decomposition. To demonstrate clinical feasibility, 4 patients were scanned using DS-PCD-CT under an institutional review board-approved study. Bone edema maps were reconstructed from DS-PCD-CT and compared with the corresponding clinical imaging exam of the same patients (MRI or DS-EID-CT).DS-PCD-CT at 70/Sn150 kV for Ca 100 mg/cc showed the highest mean DER (2.49 and 2.56 at 30 and 40 cm, respectively) among all scan configurations. For the 50-cm phantom at Ca 100 mg/cc, DS-PCD-CT at 90/Sn150 kV showed highest mean DER (1.88), followed by DS-EID-CT at 90/Sn 150 kV (1.87) and SS-PCD-CT at 140 kV (1.78). The MAPE values for DS-PCD-CT were consistently lower across all phantom sizes (MAPE max. of 1.44%) compared to SS-PCD-CT (MAPE max. 3.97%) and DS-EID-CT (MAPE max. 3.68%). Qualitatively, patient images illustrated bone edema depiction on DS-PCD-CT comparable to clinical MR images, and more precise edema depiction compared to DS-EID-CT images at the site of fractures and intramedullary lesions, and with fewer artifacts.DS-PCD-CT showed superior spectral performance for calcium imaging tasks compared to SS-PCD-CT and DS-EID-CT.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Detection of pCCA in PSC when curative action can be taken is challenging. Our aim was to create a deep learning model that analyzed MRI to detect early-stage pCCA and compare its diagnostic performance with expert radiologists.We conducted a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study involving adults with large duct PSC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Senior abdominal radiologists reviewed the images. All patients with pCCA had early-stage cancer and were registered for liver transplantation. We trained a 3D DenseNet-121 model, a form of deep learning, using MRI images and assessed its performance in a separate test cohort. The study included 398 patients (training cohort n=150; test cohort n=248). pCCA was present in 230 individuals (training cohort n=64; test cohort n=166). In the test cohort, the respective performances of the model compared to the radiologists were: sensitivity 87.9% versus 50.0%, p <0.001; specificity 84.1% versus 100.0%, p <0.001; area under receiving operating curve 86.0% versus 75.0%, p <0.001. Even when a mass was absent, the model had a higher sensitivity for pCCA than radiologists (91.6% vs. 50.6%, p <0.001) and maintained good specificity (84.1%).The 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients.

Telehospitalists supported ED clinicians in medical care decisions and facilitated patient disposition. Emergency department length of stay (LOS) and disposition were evaluated, as were hospital LOS, 30-day readmission, and in-hospital mortality. For patients discharged from the ED, 7-day ED readmission and subsequent hospitalization were evaluated.ResultsTelehospitalists discussed 550 ""admit-likely"" patients with ED clinicians: 105 patients (19.1%) discharged from the ED and avoided admission; 322 patients (58.5%) were admitted to local or nearby community hospitals; 123 patients (22.4%) transferred to the tertiary care facility.

The telehospitalists helped ED staff decide which patients needed to be admitted to the hospital and which could safely be sent home. 

The researchers found that this telehospitalist model was effective - 19% of patients were able to be discharged from the ED instead of being admitted, and those admitted to local hospitals had lower readmission rates compared to patients transferred to the main hospital. The telehospitalists were also able to reduce the time patients spent in the ED waiting for a decision on their care. 

This innovative approach helps optimize the use of hospital resources by avoiding unnecessary admissions and getting patients the right level of care more efficiently. It also supports local hospitals and communities by allowing them to manage more patients locally rather than transferring them to a larger facility. While more research is needed, this telehospitalist model shows promise as a way to improve patient care and hospital operations, especially in areas with limited healthcare resources.",,

They found that FSGS recurrence is a common problem, occurring in up to 30% of transplant recipients, and that it can lead to rapid kidney failure if not properly managed. Potential risk factors include the original cause of the FSGS, certain genetic factors, and the body's immune response to the new kidney. Treatment options range from medications to remove harmful proteins in the blood, to plasmapheresis to filter the blood, to the use of rituximab or other immunosuppressant drugs.

39724652,2026-01-02,Lack of progress in cancer-related outcomes after liver transplantation: Mitigating risk and identifying future needs to move this needle.,"Malignancy has a crucial impact on long-term survival after liver transplantation. There have been enhanced early detection rates with refined cancer screening and improved prognosis for many cancer diagnoses in the general population with the advent of targeted anticancer therapies. Similar advancements have not occurred in the transplant population over this same timeframe. Individualized strategies to reduce the risk of cancer are needed in this high-risk population. Strict adherence to screening and surveillance specific to the transplant population is required. Lifestyle modifications and medication management (both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive) that may impact cancer risk and outcome are highlighted here. As more effective anticancer therapies evolve, transplant recipients' access to these agents is paramount to truly impact cancer-related outcomes in this population. With adequate immunosuppression, rejection rates with immunotherapy are lower than previously purported. Prospective studies of immunosuppression modifications needed to minimize rejection and maximize cancer response are ongoing and will reduce the fear from oncology and transplant providers alike, allowing utilization of the most optimal therapy available to the individual.

To date, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment for patients with coronal plane fractures of the lunate, or Lichtman Stage IIIC. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether coronal plane fractures of the lunate in Kienböck disease healed after surgical intervention, and to determine the outcomes after surgical fixation of the lunate compared with treatment with salvage procedures.A retrospective review of 36 patients with Lichtman IIIC Kienböck disease was conducted. Patients were classified into lunate reconstruction (vascularized bone graft [VBG] or non-VBG) or salvage procedures (proximal row carpectomy [PRC] or limited fusion). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain, range of motion, grip strength, and Mayo Wrist Score (MWS) were analyzed. Radiographs and computed tomographic scans were reviewed for Lichtman stage, fracture location, union, modified carpal height ratio, Stahl index, and radioscaphoid angle.Thirteen patients underwent lunate reconstruction, 13 underwent limited fusion, and 10 underwent PRC. The overall union rate was 45% after lunate reconstruction, with average time to union of 7 months. There were no differences in union rates between VBG and non-VBG. All 3 groups experienced improvement in their postoperative grip strength and MWS. There were no statistically significant differences in preoperative to postoperative changes in clinical outcome measures between the 3 cohorts; however, when we compared lunate reconstruction with all patients who underwent salvage procedures (limited carpal fusion and PRC), we noted the latter had improved functional outcomes (P = .019). Four patients (31%) in the reconstruction cohort and 2 patients (8%) in the limited carpal fusion group required reoperation at latest follow-up.Union rate of coronal plane fractures in Kienböck disease remains variable.

40850609,2026-01-02,Partial diaphragm division is associated with decreased ventilator support after open thoracoabdominal aortic repair.,"The most common complications of open thoracoabdominal aortic repair (OTAAR) are respiratory in nature. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative diaphragm management on prolonged postoperative ventilation, pulmonary complications, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing OTAAR.We conducted a retrospective single-institutional review of patients who underwent extent I to V OTAAR between 2013 and 2024. Patients who did not require diaphragm division were excluded. Outcomes were analyzed in two groups based on full circumferential division (FCD) or partial circumferential division (PD). The primary outcome was prolonged ventilation, defined as postoperative ventilator support for >48 hours. Secondary outcomes included early respiratory morbidity, in-hospital mortality, major adverse events, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays. Univariate followed by multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association of extent of diaphragm division with the primary and secondary outcomes.Among 135 patients who underwent OTAAR during the study period, 110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The average patient age was 54 ±14 years, and 77 patients (70%) were male. Most repairs were done for postdissection aneurysms (n = 83 [76%]) requiring extent II thoracoabdominal aortic repair (n = 88 [80%]). Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative variables were similar between the two groups. FCD was performed in 60 patients (54%), and 50 patients (46%) underwent PD. Prolonged ventilation occurred in 25 patients (24%). On univariate analysis, patients who underwent FCD were more likely to have prolonged ventilation as compared with those who underwent PD (32% [n = 18] vs 15% [n = 7]; P = .037). This association persisted on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.8; P = .01). Patients who underwent FCD demonstrated a trend toward higher rates of postoperative pneumonia (35% vs 25%), need for reintubation (16% vs 8%), and ICU readmission (20% vs 10%). No significant differences were seen when comparing in-hospital mortality, length of ICU and hospital stays, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, or renal failure requiring dialysis.PD of the diaphragm is associated with a shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation without any significant impact on mortality or major adverse events.

We hypothesized that adults with COA had increased LA stiffness, and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and impaired aerobic capacity compared to controls, and that LA stiffness index was associated with the presence of these abnormalities in the COA group.In this prospective study, 46 adults with repaired COA and 46 controls underwent exercise echocardiogram with expired gas analysis. LA stiffness was assessed at rest as the quotient for lateral E/e' and LA reservoir strain (E/e'/LARS). Cardiac reserve was assessed by exercise-induced change in LA reservoir strain, right ventricular free wall strain/right ventricular systolic pressure (RV-PA coupling), and cardiac output (CO). Pulmonary congestion was assessed by lung ultrasound.The COA group had higher LA stiffness index (0.47 ± 0.12 vs 0.14 ± 0.09, P < .001), and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity compared to controls. Within the COA group, those with high LA stiffness index (>0.42) had worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and aerobic capacity. The correlates of LA stiffness index were high pulsatile left ventricular (LV) afterload, LV hypertrophy, and atrial fibrillation.These data suggest a mechanistic link between LA stiffness, pulmonary congestion, and exercise intolerance among patients with COA, and the correlates of LA stiffness index may provide viable targets for therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in this population.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This suggests that intrathecal hydromorphone could be a promising option to improve pain management and recovery for women undergoing cesarean sections. However, the study had a relatively small number of participants, so further research with larger groups would be needed to confirm these findings and better understand the long-term benefits and risks of this approach. Overall, this study represents an important step in refining pain relief methods for this common surgical procedure, which could ultimately lead to improved outcomes and experiences for new mothers.",,
40816607,2026-01-02,A Randomized Sham-Controlled Phase 2/3 Trial of QPI-1007 for Acute Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.,"Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients > 50 years of age, has no proven therapy. We report the results of a phase 2/3 clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of QPI-1007, a small interfering RNA against the apoptotic protein caspase 2, in participants with acute-onset NAION.International, multicenter, double-masked, sham-controlled randomized trial.Seven hundred twenty-five participants with acute unilateral NAION enrolled within 14 days of visual symptoms.Intravitreal injection of QPI-1007 into the study eye of a single dose, multiple dose, or sham injection. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 5 treatment groups (down to 3 treatment groups after a preplanned interim analysis): 1 intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg, 1 intravitreal injection of 3 mg, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 1.5 mg each, 3 bimonthly intravitreal injections of 3.0 mg each, or sham injection.The primary end points were safety and the proportion of patients losing at least 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between day 1 and month 6. Secondary outcome measures were mean change in BCVA and mean change in visual field (VF) sensitivity from day 1 to month 6.At 6 months, no difference was found in the proportion of participants who lost 15 letters or more of BCVA in the multidose groups compared with the sham group. A subanalysis of participants with baseline BCVA of ≤ 60 letters or fewer (Snellen equivalent, ≤ 20/63) demonstrated a significantly lower proportion losing 10 letters of BCVA (P = 0.045 for the 1.5 mg × 3 group and P = 0.0104 for the 3.0 mg × 3 group) compared to sham. Significant prevention of 7-dB loss of VF mean deviation was seen in participants with ≤ 60 letters or fewer at baseline (P = 0.023). No significant differences were found in the frequency of adverse events between groups other than expected side-effects of intravitreal injection.Intravitreal injection of QPI-1007 in eyes with acute NAION was well tolerated. Although the primary outcome measure was not met, significant effects on preserving vision were observed in the subgroup of participants with baseline BCVA of 20/63 or worse.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.Copyright © 2025 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

ADP-A2AFP is an investigational autologous T-cell therapy with an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).We describe a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial of ADP-A2AFP (NCT03132792) in human leukocyte antigen-eligible participants with AFP-expressing HCC (or other tumor) not amenable to transplant/resection who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused prior systemic therapy. Participants received lymphodepletion chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 20 mg/m2/day for 3 days, or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 4 days) followed by ADP-A2AFP intravenous infusion. Safety evaluation was the primary objective; response per RECIST v1.1 was the key secondary endpoint.Twenty-one participants, 20 with advanced HCC and one with gastric hepatoid carcinoma received ≥1 ADP-A2AFP infusion. All participants experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher adverse event; 52.4% experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher event considered related to ADP-A2AFP treatment. Six participants experienced cytokine release syndrome (grade 1-2: n = 5; grade 4: n = 1). Best overall responses were complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), and stable disease (n = 12); overall response rate was 9.5%. Eight patients had a stable disease duration of ≥16 weeks. Infiltration of ADP-A2AFP TCR and CD8+ T cells was seen in AFP-positive areas of post-treatment tumor samples. A relationship was demonstrated between increased ADP-A2AFP dose and serum AFP reduction in responders.Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell therapy showed a manageable safety profile and preliminary indications of antitumor activity in these previously treated patients.Adoptive T-cell therapy could be a much-needed additional treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinicians and researchers interested in the development of adoptive T-cell therapies for advanced solid tumors will be interested to learn that in this phase I trial, ADP-A2AFP T-cell receptor T-cell therapy was associated with an acceptable benefit-to-risk profile and encouraging antitumor activity, illustrating the treatment potential of adoptive T-cell therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.NCT03132792; first posted 2017-04-08.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

In this early-stage clinical trial, the researchers gave 21 patients a personalized T-cell therapy called ADP-A2AFP. This therapy uses the patients' own immune cells that have been genetically modified to better recognize and attack cancer cells. The patients first received chemotherapy to weaken their immune system, then were infused with the modified T-cells. 

The results showed the therapy had an acceptable safety profile, with some manageable side effects. Encouragingly, 2 patients had their tumors shrink, and 12 others had their disease stabilize for at least 16 weeks.

Disruptions in these pathways can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiencies, which present with a spectrum of clinical features, including congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Biallelic variants in PIGV, a key mannosyltransferase in GPI biosynthesis, cause Hyperphosphatasia with Impaired Intellectual Development Syndrome 1 (HPMRS1), a rare disorder characterized by hyperphosphatasia, seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal MRI findings, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. Fewer than 30 cases have been reported to date. We conducted a case study and literature review; with clinical data obtained from medical records. A 2-year-old female presented with developmental delay, myoclonic epilepsy, hypotonia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Laboratory results showed elevated alkaline phosphatase (899 U/L) and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss and ventriculomegaly. Trio genome sequencing identified two PIGV variants: c.1415T>C-p.(Leu472Pro) and c.524T>C-p.(Leu175Pro). Functional studies using PIGV-knockout HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant PIGV constructs demonstrated reduced GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) expression under weaker promoters, indicating impaired enzymatic activity. We report two novel PIGV variants associated with HPMRS1, emphasizing the value of functional assays in variant interpretation.

In this study, the researchers investigated two novel variants, or mutations, in the PIGV gene found in a 2-year-old girl with developmental delays, seizures, and elevated levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase. Using advanced genetic testing and laboratory experiments, the researchers demonstrated that these PIGV variants impair the enzyme's normal function, leading to the observed clinical symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of measuring alkaline phosphatase levels in patients with seizures that are difficult to treat, as this can help diagnose HPMRS1 and other related disorders.

40796057,2026-01-02,Demonstrating commutability of an existing certified reference material for use with an end-user measurement procedure that was not included in the original commutability assessment.,"Commutability assessment of a certified reference material (CRM) intended for use as a secondary calibrator should be performed by the CRM producer at the time the material is originally prepared. Assessment typically includes several in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) measurement procedures (MPs) in common use in medical laboratories. Due to logistical constraints, it is usually not possible to include all existing IVD-MPs in a commutability assessment. In addition, a new IVD-MP (IVD-MPn) may be introduced into the market after a commutability assessment was performed for a given CRM. Here we provide a recommendation how to assess commutability of an existing CRM for use with an IVD-MPn that was not included in the original commutability assessment. The study design follows the same principles as a full commutability assessment, but it includes only the IVD-MPn and fewer additional comparator MP(s) for which the CRM's commutability with clinical samples was previously demonstrated. When no reference measurement procedure (RMP) is available, or when the logistics make an RMP difficult to use, other IVD-MP(s) that were part of the original commutability assessment for the CRM should be used as comparator MP(s). When selecting a comparator IVD-MP, its performance must be carefully considered and its selectivity for the measurand should be equivalent to that of the IVD-MPn. The CRM should have had negligible noncommutability bias with the comparator IVD-MP in the original commutability assessment. When the existing CRM meets the commutability criterion for IVD-MPn, the CRM can be used in the calibration hierarchy of the IVD-MPn.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

When a new medical test is developed, it needs to be calibrated using a standardized reference material. However, it's not always possible for the reference material producer to test the material with every new test that comes on the market.

The researchers used a step-by-step process to evaluate whether an existing certified reference material could be used with a new medical test that wasn't part of the original assessment. This involved comparing the results from the new test to results from other medical tests that had already been shown to work well with the reference material. By demonstrating that the reference material produces consistent, reliable results across multiple tests, the researchers were able to confirm that it can be used to calibrate the new test as well.

The impact of this on oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescription fills and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not known.Using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data from 2016 to 2018, we evaluated OAC prescription fills in patients with AF by assessing their proportion of days covered on OAC before, during, and after their coverage gap. Hazard of stroke was assessed for patients who entered the coverage gap before entering, while in, and after exiting, the gap.Patients who entered the coverage gap had a 16% decrease in median proportion of days covered from pregap (0.92 [interquartile range 0.80, 0.97]) to in-gap (0.76 [0.41, 0.98]).

The registry captures comprehensive patient demographics, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes, including complications, readmissions, and reoperations within 30 and 90 days. Additionally, the ASR incorporates Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) such as PROMIS, VR-12, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess functional recovery.Between January 1, 2020, and June 27, 2023, the ASR Cervical Module (N=45,013) was dominated by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF, 64.0%), followed by instrumentation (30.6%) and posterior fusion (22.4%). The Lumbar Module (N=184,682) most frequently included transforaminal/posterior lumbar interbody fusion (32.3%), posterior disc laminectomy (29.5%), and posterolateral fusion (29.2%). Overall reoperation rates were 5.8% in the cervical group versus 10.4% in the lumbar group, with ""Other"" causes (eg, infection, wound-related complication, pain) accounting for a larger share in lumbar (8.1%) than cervical (4.6%). Notably, adjacent segment disease (ASD) was also more common in lumbar patients (1.4% vs 0.1%). For timing of reoperation, a greater proportion of lumbar patients underwent reoperation within both the short-term (≤30 days: 3.6% vs 2.6%) and long-term (>90 days: 4.7% vs 1.8%) intervals.The ASR represents a critical advancement in spine surgery data collection, providing valuable insights into practice patterns, outcomes, and opportunities for quality improvement.

However, the mechanisms by which fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols drive IBS pathophysiology are unclear.Patients with Rome IV diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) underwent barrier function evaluation pre- and post-LFD along with assessment of mast cell number and activation profile. Finally, fecal supernatants (FS) were administered intracolonically to wild-type mice with and without pharmacologic inhibition, toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-/- mice, and mast cell-deficient mice with/without mast cell reconstitution.Of 42 patients, 34 responded to the LFD and 8 did not. Patients with IBS-D had significant improvement in colonic barrier structure and function, mast cell number, and levels of mast cell mediators post-LFD. The magnitude of physiological changes did not correlate with the magnitude of clinical response. Humanization of germ-free mice with pre-LFD feces caused barrier dysfunction and post-LFD feces did not. Similarly, pre-LFD FS caused barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice, whereas post-LFD FS did not. Lipopolysaccharide removal and TLR4 antagonism reversed pre-LFD IBS FS-induced barrier dysfunction. Barrier dysfunction was absent in tlr4-/- mice treated with pre-LFD FS. Similarly, pre-LFD IBS FS did not cause barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice treated with mast cell stabilizer or in mast cell-deficient mice. However, barrier dysfunction was inducible in mast cell-deficient mice upon reconstitution with wild-type mast cells, but not tlr4-/- mast cells.Patients with IBS-D exhibited improvement in colonic barrier dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post LFD. Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols-mediated barrier dysfunction in IBS-D is mediated by direct activation of the TLR4 receptor on colonic mast cells by fecal lipopolysaccharide.gov, Number: NCT04542018.Copyright © 2026 The Authors.

The researchers looked at how this diet affects the gut barrier function and mast cell activation (a type of immune cell) in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. They found that the low-FODMAP diet led to significant improvements in the structure and function of the gut barrier, as well as reduced mast cell numbers and activation. Importantly, the researchers were able to show that the gut bacteria and bacterial byproducts from before the diet change were responsible for causing gut barrier dysfunction, and that this effect was mediated through the activation of mast cells. This suggests that the low-FODMAP diet works by reducing the levels of these problematic bacterial byproducts, thereby improving gut barrier function and reducing mast cell-driven inflammation. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms behind how dietary changes can benefit patients with IBS, and may lead to the development of more targeted treatments for this common and often debilitating condition.",,
40738195,2026-01-02,Heterogeneity in HeartMate 3 implanting center infection management reveals opportunities for quality improvement and best practice initiatives during left ventricular assist device support.,"There is marked variability in device-related (DR) infection frequencies across HeartMate 3 (HM3) centers. The goal is to correlate center driveline (DL) management and infection mitigation practices with DR-infection development, laying foundation for development of best practice recommendations for one facet of HM3 patient care.Coordinators at 30 HM3 centers were surveyed about center practices for infection prophylaxis, intraoperative DL placement and postoperative care, and infection mitigation. Early (≤90 days) and late (>90 day) center DR-infection frequencies were calculated from Society of Thoracic Surgeons Intermacs data linkage. Correlations between center practice patterns and incident DR-infection were examined with multivariable Cox modeling (clustering adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]).Within Intermacs (3,725 patients), 1-year freedom from DR-infection was 87% (80.6-87.3%). Initially, DL dressing changes were performed daily, weekly, and variably at 48%, 21% and 31% of centers. After 4 weeks, 57% deescalated dressing changes to weekly. Chlorhexidine cleanser with a silver-impregnated dressing (Chl-Sil) was standard at 52.7% of programs; 47.3% used chlorhexidine alone or other supplies. Use of Chl-Sil was associated with reduced early (aHR 0.48, p=0.004) and late (aHR 0.64, p=0.02) DR-infection while frequent dressing changes conferred higher late DR-infection (aHR 1.4, p=0.05). Antibiotic prophylaxis, DL tunneling, and diabetes practices did not correlate with DR-infection.Given the burden of DR-infections, best practice recommendations are needed to standardize care. Application of Chl-Sil DL dressings could be a first step in achieving care standardization, while frequent dressing changes following DL incorporation should be avoided.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Cognitive ergonomics refers to the design of tools, environments, and processes to support the mental abilities of healthcare workers and improve patient safety. The authors, who are part of the Society of Surgical Ergonomics, argue that optimizing the cognitive ergonomics of surgery can lead to ""sharper minds and safer surgeries.""

The paper provides a perspective on how factors like information overload, distractions, and poor workflow design can negatively impact a surgeon's focus, decision-making, and overall performance. The researchers review studies demonstrating how simple changes, such as reducing unnecessary alerts or improving display layouts, can enhance a surgeon's cognitive capacity and reduce the risk of medical errors. 

These findings have important implications for patient care. By prioritizing cognitive ergonomics, hospitals can create operating room environments that better support surgeons' mental processes, leading to fewer mistakes and improved surgical outcomes. This is especially crucial as medical technology becomes more complex and surgeons face growing cognitive demands. While more research is needed, this paper makes a compelling case for integrating cognitive ergonomics principles into the design and management of surgical workflows an",,
40715769,2026-01-02,Understanding the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescence from a brain and behavioral developmental perspective.,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is common among teenagers. Adolescence is a transitional period marked by critical brain changes, coinciding with major changes in how teenagers regulate emotions and impulses, as well as in how they understand themselves and interact with others. We review neuroimaging evidence supporting a developmental conceptualization of suicide risk, focusing on neural changes associated with key developmental tasks of adolescence. Functional and structural imaging studies have implicated medial prefrontal, cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and frontolimbic circuitry changes in youth with STBs. There is emerging evidence that psychotherapeutic and neuromodulatory interventions can engage these brain processes and modify behavior in at-risk youth. We argue that harnessing these techniques more specifically by using targeted approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation, impulse control, positive identity development, and healthy social functioning is a promising way forward for reducing suicide risk in teens. Continued investigation into neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence is critical for developing more effective risk assessment and treatment approaches to aid suicidal youth in navigating adolescent development and transitioning successfully to adulthood.© 2025.

During adolescence, the brain and behavior go through critical changes that can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This research paper examines how these developmental changes in the brain may contribute to the emergence of suicidal tendencies in youth. 

The researchers reviewed brain imaging studies that looked at differences in brain structure and function between teenagers with and without suicidal thoughts or behaviors. They found that several brain regions involved in regulating emotions, controlling impulses, and understanding oneself and social interactions showed changes associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents. This suggests that the typical brain development during this transitional period may play a key role in the increased suicide risk seen in teens.

The findings indicate that targeted interventions, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation techniques, which can modify these brain processes, may be a promising approach to reducing suicide risk in young people. Further research is needed to fully understand the neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence, which could lead to more effective ways to identify and support youth at risk of suicide as they navigate this critical developmental stage and transition into adulthood.",,
40712932,2026-01-02,Enhancement of Inpatient Mortality Prognostication With Machine Learning in a Prospective Global Cohort of Patients With Cirrhosis With External Validation.,"Cirrhosis is a major global burden requiring frequent hospitalizations and has high inpatient mortality. Traditional prognostic tools focused on inpatient mortality are affected by global disparities, which impacts timely management. We aimed to deploy machine learning (ML) approaches to enhance inpatient mortality prognostication.Using the prospective Chronic Liver Disease Evolution and Registry for Events and Decompensation (CLEARED) cohort, which enrolled inpatients with cirrhosis globally, we used admission-day data to predict inpatient mortality with ML approaches vs logistic regression. Internal validation (75/25 split) and subdivision using World Bank income status (low/low-middle-income countries, upper-middle income countries, and high-income countries) were performed. The ML model with the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was externally validated in a US veteran inpatient population with cirrhosis.The CLEARED cohort included 7239 inpatients with cirrhosis (64% were men; mean [SD] age, 56 [13] years; median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 25) from 115 centers globally; 22.5% were from low/low-middle-income countries, 41% were from upper-middle-income countries, and 34% were from high-income countries; 11.1% of patients (n = 808) died in the hospital. Random forest (RF) showed the best AUROC (0.815) with high calibration, which was significantly better vs parametric logistic regression and LASSO models (AUROC, 0.774; P < .001 and AUROC, 0.787; P = .004, respectively). RF was the ML method with the highest AUROC and remained better than logistic regression, regardless of country income level (high-income countries: AUROC, 0.806; upper middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.867; and low/low-middle-income countries: AUROC, 0.768). External validation was performed in 28,670 veterans (96% were men, mean [SD] age, 67.8 [10.3] years, median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score = 15) with 4% (n = 1158) inpatient mortality. The AUROC using the CLEARED-derived RF model was 0.859.RF analysis trained on a global prospective cirrhosis cohort enhances mortality prediction over traditional methods, was consistent across country income levels, and was successfully validated externally in a US veteran population.Published by Elsevier Inc.",Gastroenterology,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Scott Silvey|Patrick S Kamath|Jacob George|Ashok Choudhury|Qing Xie|Mark Topazian|Hailemichael D Mekonnen|Zhujun Cao|Aabha Nagral|K R Reddy|Danielle Adebayo|Sumeet K Asrani|Neil Rajoriya|Marco Arrese|Sevda Aghayeva|Mithun Sharma|Sarai G Huezo|Adrian Gadano|Hasan B Yapici|Nabil Debzi|Jawaid Shaw|Somaya Albhaisi|José L Pérez Hernández|Yingling Wang|Feng Peng|Linlin Wei|C E Eapen|Hiang K Tan|James Y Fung|Ruveena Rajaram|Kessarin Thanapirom|Haydar Adanır|Adam Doyle|Shalimar|Minghua Su|Dinesh Jothimani|Yijing Cai|Rene M Velazquez|Wei Wang|Michael Gounder|Cameron Gofton|Sezgin Barutcu|Busra Haktaniyan|Alberto Q Farias|Aloysious D Aravinthan|Chinmay Bera|Surender Singh|Peter C Hayes|Ramazan Idilman|Aldo Torre|Mario R Alvares-da-Silva|Wai-Kay K Seto|Florence Wong|Brian J Bush|Leroy R Thacker|Nilang Patel|Jasmohan S Bajaj,Patrick S Kamath,"School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.|The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, North South Wales, Australia.|Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Delhi, India.|Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.|St Paul's Hospital, Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.|Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, India.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, United Kingdom.|Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.|University Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.|Pontificia Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan.|Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, India.|Centro Médico ISSEMYM, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.|Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.|Mustapha Bacha University Hospital of Algiers, Algiers, Algeria.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.|Hospital General de México Eduardo Licaga, Mexico City, Mexico.|The Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou, Suzhou, China.|The Second XiangYa Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.|Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.|Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.|Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.|The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.|Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.|All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.|Rela Institute, Chennai, India.|The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.|Instituto de la Salud Digestiva, Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico.|The Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei, China.|Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.|Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.|Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.|University of Sao Paolo, Sao Paolo, Brazil.|School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.|University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Research, Lucknow, India.|Division of Health Sciences, Deanery of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.|Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.|School of Public Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.|Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia; Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.

Cirrhosis is a major global health problem, often requiring hospital stays, and has high mortality rates. Traditional methods for predicting inpatient death have limitations, especially in different countries and income levels. 

The researchers used a large international dataset of over 7,000 hospitalized cirrhosis patients to train a machine learning model to predict inpatient mortality. This model performed significantly better than standard statistical methods, accurately predicting death 82% of the time. Importantly, the machine learning approach maintained its high accuracy regardless of the patient's country or income level. The model was then successfully validated in a separate group of over 28,000 U.S. veterans with cirrhosis.

This research demonstrates that advanced machine learning can enhance doctors' ability to identify high-risk cirrhosis patients early in their hospital stay, which could lead to more timely and effective treatment. The global, diverse dataset used to develop the model also suggests it may be useful for predicting outcomes in cirrhosis patients worldwide, helping address disparities in care.

40692167,2026-01-02,What Is the Appropriate Sample Size in Human Cadaveric Studies? A Quantitative Review of 770 Articles.,"Determining an appropriate sample size in human cadaveric studies remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. Unlike other basic science fields, anatomical research is constrained by factors such as limited human donor availability, cultural considerations, and ethical restrictions. Despite these limitations, researchers are often asked to justify sample sizes, yet no standardized guidelines currently exist. To quantitatively assess sample sizes in recent human cadaveric studies and propose evidence-based recommendations for future research, a PubMed search was conducted on February 26, 2024, using the term human cadaveric study. The articles published in 2023 and 2024 were screened, yielding 770 eligible studies. Data extracted included the total sample size, number of classified groups, and journal impact factor (IF). Descriptive statistics, linear regression, and correlation analyses were performed. Continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). The median sample size was 11.5 (IQR: 7-20), and 47.9% of studies used 10 or fewer specimens. The median number of classified groups was 3 (IQR: 2-4). Linear regression showed that studies dividing specimens into 2-6 groups often failed to meet the recommended sample size per group based on regression modeling. No significant correlation was found between sample size and journal IF (r = -0.062, p = 0.115). Most cadaveric studies rely on small sample sizes due to inherent constraints, yet many still attempt a subgroup analysis without sufficient statistical power. Although flexibility is essential in anatomical research, we recommend a minimum total sample size of 10 for basic studies and at least five samples per group for those involving classification. Cadaveric sample size alone does not predict journal impact, highlighting the importance of methodological rigor over quantity.© 2025 The Author(s).

The primary endpoints were the rate of local pathological complete response (negative in-field biopsy) and the incidence, type, and severity of adverse events by 12 mo. The secondary endpoints included PSA kinetics, changes in prostate volume, retreatment, and urinary/sexual function.Of the 121 patients treated with IRE, the negative in-field biopsy rate at 12 mo was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62%, 79%). The secondary endpoint of negative in-field biopsy rate defined by the Delphi consensus criterion was 84% (95% CI: 76%, 90%). The time to median PSA nadir was 3.5 mo, and the median percent reduction in PSA at 6 mo was 68.2%. Urinary function outcomes had a mean change from baseline to 12 mo of 3 in the University of California Los Angeles Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary domain total score and a mean change of -2 in the International Prostate Symptom Score total symptom score.

Prostate cancer is a common cancer that affects many older men, and finding effective treatments is important. The researchers conducted a clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of IRE, which uses electrical pulses to destroy cancer cells in the prostate without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. 

The study included 121 men with prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the prostate gland. The researchers found that 71% of patients had no detectable cancer in the treated area of the prostate 12 months after the IRE procedure. Patients also experienced improvements in urinary function and maintained sexual function. While a small number of patients had serious side effects, overall the treatment appeared safe and well-tolerated.

It is unknown whether incidence varies by race and ethnicity.In a prospective, observational study using active real-time surveillance of electronic health records, we identified 18,838 adults 50 years or older with glycemically defined new-onset diabetes (GNOD). In this interim analysis, we report 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after GNOD (absolute incidence [95% CI]) and associated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) by race and ethnicity, overall 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer adjusting for racial distribution of incident diabetes in the United States, and interval between GNOD and pancreatic cancer diagnosis.During median follow-up of 2.3 years, 82 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed (60% in men; mean [SD] age, 71 [8] years). The 3-year estimates for the proportion diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and associated SIR by race and ethnicity were as follows: non-Hispanic White patients (n = 6518): 0.84% (95% CI, 0.60%-1.07%) and 6.4 (95% CI, 4.8-8.4); Hispanic patients (n = 5984): 0.40% (95% CI, 0.20%-0.60%) and 4.2 (95% CI, 2.6-6.3); African American patients (n = 2192): 0.37% (95% CI, 0.07%-0.67%) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0-5.0), and Asian/Pacific Islander patients (n = 3360): 0.22% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.39%) and 3.0 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0). Overall, race-adjusted 3-year pancreatic cancer incidence was 0.62%. On average, GNOD occurred 8 months before clinical diagnosis (0-4 months in 30.5%, 4-12 months in 31.3%, 12-24 months in 19.5%, and 24-36 months in 18.7%).GNOD, identifiable in real time using active surveillance of electronic health records, is associated with a high 3-year incidence of pancreatic cancer with marked racial and ethnic differences.

41106048,2026-01-02,Segmental asymmetry and multiplanar motion of the lumbar spine: Cadaveric insights into spinal pathologies.,"The lumbar spine plays a critical role in supporting multiplanar motion and distributing loads during daily activities. While global spinal symmetry is often assumed in biomechanical assessments, segmental asymmetries may exist and contribute to conditions such as low back pain (LBP). The present study investigates the multiplanar kinematic behavior and torque asymmetry of the lumbar spine using cadaveric specimens, focusing on identifying segmental asymmetries that may be masked in global motion analysis. A novel experimental setup combining a 6°-of-freedom robotic system with optical metrology was used to apply controlled flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation to human lumbar spines. The metrology system enabled precise, non-contact tracking of vertebral motion in three dimensions, ensuring accurate quantification of segmental kinematics. Symmetrical motion inputs were applied bilaterally during lateral bending and axial rotation, while torque responses were recorded. Segmental range of motion (ROM) and torque asymmetries were quantified in the coronal and axial planes. Despite symmetrical inputs, torque outputs showed asymmetries exceeding 15 % in several specimens. Segmental ROM asymmetries were observed in most vertebrae, sometimes exceeding 40 %, and could vary across planes without consistent correlation. Notably, some spines exhibited segmental asymmetry despite overall torque symmetry, highlighting the limitations of global assessments. These findings underscore the importance of segment-level analysis in spinal biomechanics. Hidden asymmetries may have clinical implications for diagnosing and treating LBP. Spinal pathologies and alignment appear to partially account for subject-specific asymmetries in lateral bending and axial rotation.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used a specialized robotic system and advanced imaging techniques to closely examine the motion and forces in different parts of the lumbar (lower) spine in donated human specimens. The researchers found that even when the same forces were applied evenly to both sides, the individual vertebrae often moved and responded asymmetrically. This segmental asymmetry was sometimes quite substantial, exceeding 40% in some cases, and did not always match the overall symmetry observed in the spine as a whole. These hidden asymmetries could have important implications for diagnosing and treating back problems, as they may not be detected by standard assessments that only look at the spine's global motion.

41110629,2026-01-02,What's New in Membranous Nephropathy and How to Incorporate New Antigen Discoveries Into Clinical Practice: A Review.,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be seen in association with other diseases, including malignancy, drugs, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Over the last decade, great progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, resulting from the discovery of several target antigens by use of laser microdissection/mass spectrometry methodology. This technique has proven to be the most sensitive method available and has the advantage of testing for all the target antigens at one time. The discovery of these target antigens has now shifted the classification of MN from primary versus secondary to classification based on the target antigen identified. Each target antigen has its own specific clinical characteristics and known associated diseases. Identification of the target antigen can help further identify the underlying cause for a more targeted approach in looking for associated diseases. Progress has also been made in the treatment of patients with MN, with more standard risk stratification of the patients and a shift in using anti-CD20 drugs as the first line for those with moderate and high risk of progression.

PSC is a rare disease that causes inflammation and scarring in the bile ducts, which can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Researchers wanted to understand how a person's age and the presence of cirrhosis might impact their risk of developing HCC, a common and deadly form of liver cancer.

The researchers analyzed medical data from a large group of PSC patients to identify factors that increased their chances of getting HCC. They found that older age and the presence of cirrhosis were the two biggest risk factors. Patients over 50 years old were much more likely to develop HCC compared to younger individuals, and those with cirrhosis had an even higher risk. This suggests that regular cancer screening may be especially important for older PSC patients and those who have progressed to cirrhosis. Understanding these risk factors can help doctors monitor high-risk patients more closely and potentially catch any cancers early, when they are most treatable. However, the study was limited to",,

Anthropometric and metabolic data were analyzed.The median age at initiation of topiramate treatment was 10.1 years (range, 7.9-11.2 years) and 64% were boys. At baseline, the median body mass index (BMI) was 149% of the 95th percentile (range, 136%-200%). The median treatment duration was 14 months (interquartile range, 9.5-24 months), with a maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg (range, 50-150 mg). There was a median decrease in BMI% of the 95th percentile of 8% (95% CI, -15 to -1.02; P = .042), and a reduction in BMI z score by 0.37 (95% CI, -0.66 to -0.05; P = .028). The most notable response was in a child with hypothalamic obesity who experienced a 35-point reduction in BMI% of the 95th percentile over 24 months. While 11 of 14 children showed reduction in BMI, 3 had no change or increase in their BMI.

This study looked at the effects of a medication called topiramate on weight and other health measures in young children with severe obesity, including those with obesity caused by problems with the hypothalamus (a part of the brain that regulates weight). The researchers reviewed the medical records of 14 children under 12 years old who were treated with topiramate. They found that on average, the children experienced an 8% decrease in their body mass index (BMI) percentage compared to the 95th percentile for their age and sex, as well as a 0.37 reduction in their BMI z-score, which is a measure that accounts for normal growth. The most dramatic result was seen in a child with hypothalamic obesity, who had a 35-point reduction in BMI percentage over 2 years. While the majority of children saw decreases in BMI, a few did not respond to the medication. Overall, this study suggests that topiramate may be a useful treatment option for managing severe obesity in young children, including those with obesity related to brain development. However,",,
41392688,2026-01-02,Investigation of the Frictional Characteristics of a Manufactured Tendon Lubricant in Canine Peroneus Longus (PL) Tendons In Vitro.,"Tendon adhesion is a major complication following tendon reconstruction surgery in the hand. Previous studies showed that a combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin, covalently bound to the tendon surface, can provide a durable gliding surface to reduce adhesions in animal models both in-vitro and in-vivo. We have developed a similar product using good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, in preparation for use in humans. This study aimed to examine the frictional properties and elastic modulus of the Manufactured Tendon Lubricant (MTL) when applied to an extrasynovial canine peroneus longus (PL) tendon in-vitro. Twenty PL tendons along with the 2nd and 5th digits from adult canine forepaws, were obtained (mean age: 12 months, weight: 35 kg) from animals sacrificed in Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols. Tendons were treated either with the MTL or saline solution, as a control. Eight tendons from each group (MTL vs saline-treated) underwent friction testing, using a previously described protocol, followed by indentation testing to assess tendon elastic modulus (a marker of successful crosslinking). Two tendons from each group were not tested and were sent for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MTL group had significantly (p < 0.001) lower friction and gliding resistance as well as higher elastic modulus of the PL tendons, compared to the saline group. This study demonstrates that MTL provides lubricating effects and fixation to the tendon surface and may be suitable for human testing.© 2025 Orthopaedic Research Society.",J Orthop Res,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,Ahmadreza Nezameslami|Ramona Reisdorf|Dirk Larson|Chunfeng Zhao|Peter Amadio,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Ahmadreza Nezameslami, Ramona Reisdorf, Dirk Larson, Chunfeng Zhao, Peter Amadio",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41392688/,"Tendon injuries and scarring are common problems following hand surgery, leading to reduced mobility and function.

The MTL-treated tendons showed significantly less friction and greater elasticity compared to the control group. This suggests the lubricant can provide a smooth, durable surface to reduce scarring and improve tendon movement after surgery. The findings are promising for developing new treatments to improve outcomes for patients undergoing hand or other tendon repair procedures. While this was an initial lab study, the researchers plan to further test the lubricant's safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials. Limitations include the small sample size and use of animal rather than human tendons, so more research is needed to confirm the results.

MS is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects the central nervous system, causing a wide range of symptoms like vision problems, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairment. The researchers aimed to identify ways to diagnose MS earlier and develop more effective treatments to halt the progression of the disease. 

The paper examines emerging technologies and research approaches that could revolutionize MS care over the next few years. For example, new imaging techniques may allow doctors to detect the earliest signs of MS before significant nerve damage occurs, leading to quicker diagnoses. Additionally, researchers are exploring novel drug therapies that could stop the immune system from attacking the nervous system, the underlying cause of MS. If successful, these treatments could prevent further disability and improve quality of life for millions of MS patients worldwide.

41384706,2026-01-02,Pathology of adrenal tumours: recent advances.,"Changes in the nomenclature and classification of adrenal gland diseases are the result of advances in understanding the pathogenesis, germline susceptibility and the clonal-neoplastic nature of diseases of the adrenal gland. Although numerous classification systems have been proposed, the Weiss system remains the standard for distinguishing benign from malignant adult adrenal cortical tumours, but the Helsinki system and the reticulin algorithm are proving to be increasingly useful in difficult cases. Subtypes of adrenal cortical neoplasms, such as myxoid and oncocytic, as well as those occurring in children require special consideration as their classification systems are different from those for standard adult adrenal cortical neoplasms. The importance of proliferative activity is central to the evaluation of adrenal cortical neoplasms. As for primary unilateral aldosteronism, CYP11B2 immunostain is increasingly studied to identify sites of aldosterone production with the hope of finding staining patterns predictive of clinical outcomes. Awareness of the clonal-neoplastic nature of adrenal cortical nodules and underlying germline susceptibilities has also advanced the classification of adrenal cortical nodular disease.

Although standard RT doses (24 Gy in 12 fractions) provide excellent disease control, they are associated with toxicity. Emerging evidence suggests that lower RT doses may maintain efficacy while reducing toxicity; however, prior prospective randomized attempts to reduce the dose to 4 Gy in 2 fractions have demonstrated inferior disease control. This phase 2 randomized trial aims to determine whether reduced-dose hypofractionated RT can achieve comparable disease control while minimizing toxicity and treatment burden. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive experimental arm treatment with 8 to 10 Gy in 2 to 5 fractions or standard of care treatment with 24 Gy in 12 fractions.

Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities. Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT) measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework - MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual back-propagation graph for deconfounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC: 0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively.

However, more research is still needed to fully understand the underlying causes and optimal treatments. This study represents an important step forward in improving care for the relatively small number of people affected by this rare disorder.",,
41358582,2026-01-02,Dual Targeting of Extramedullary Myeloma with Talquetamab and Teclistamab.,"Patients with plasmacytomas that are noncontiguous with bone marrow (true extramedullary myeloma) are at high risk for disease progression or relapse. Phase 1 of the RedirecTT-1 study showed promising efficacy with dual-antigen targeting of myeloma with talquetamab (anti-G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D) plus teclistamab (anti-B-cell maturation antigen) in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including those with true extramedullary myeloma.In this phase 2 study, we investigated talquetamab plus teclistamab exclusively in patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma. The primary end point was overall response, evaluated with the use of functional imaging. Secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study and received treatment (median follow-up, 12.6 months). A response occurred in 79% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 87). Among the patients with a response, the percentage with a response duration of at least 12 months was 64% (95% CI, 48 to 76). At 12 months, progression-free survival was 61% (95% CI, 50 to 71), and overall survival was 74% (95% CI, 63 to 83). Common adverse events of any grade included oral symptoms, such as dysgeusia, dry mouth, and dysphagia (in 87% of the patients); cytokine release syndrome (in 78%); and nonrash skin effects (in 69%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (most commonly hematologic events) occurred in 76% of the patients; 31% had grade 3 or 4 infection. A nonfatal adverse event led to discontinuation of one or both agents in 6% of the patients. Among 10 deaths that occurred during follow-up, 5 were due to infection and 5 were considered to be related to the study treatment.Most patients with drug-resistant, true extramedullary myeloma had a response with talquetamab plus teclistamab. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was high and was consistent with previous observations for each agent as monotherapy.

Patients with multiple myeloma that has spread outside the bone marrow (called extramedullary myeloma) often have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The researchers tested a combination of two experimental drugs, talquetamab and teclistamab, in 90 patients with advanced, drug-resistant extramedullary myeloma. 

The results showed that the drug combination was effective, with 79% of patients responding to the treatment. Among those who responded, 64% maintained their response for at least 12 months. The treatment also appeared to slow disease progression, with 61% of patients remaining progression-free at 12 months. However, the therapy did have significant side effects, including oral symptoms, immune system reactions, and infections, which led some patients to discontinue the treatment.

These findings suggest that dual targeting of extramedullary myeloma with talquetamab and teclistamab could be a promising new approach for patients with this difficult-to-treat form of multiple myeloma. While the side effects will nee",,
41344792,2026-01-02,"Quantifying the fatal and non-fatal burden of disease associated with child growth failure, 2000-2023: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Child growth failure (CGF), which includes underweight, wasting, and stunting, is among the factors most strongly associated with mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Poor height and bodyweight gain arise from a variety of biological and sociodemographic factors and are associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to estimate CGF prevalence, the risk of infectious diseases associated with CGF, and the disease mortality, morbidity, and overall burden associated with CGF.In this analysis we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific (diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and measles) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and mortality associated with stunting, wasting, underweight, and CGF in aggregate. We combined the burden associated with mild, moderate, and severe forms of CGF: stunting was defined as height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) less than -1, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) less than -1, and wasting was defined as weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) less than -1, according to WHO Child Growth Standards. Population-level continuous distributions of HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ were estimated for 2000 to 2023 using data from surveys, literature, and individual-level study data. The risk of incidence of, and mortality due to, diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles was separately estimated in a meta-regression framework from longitudinal cohort data for Z scores less than -1. Finally, fatal outcomes associated with these diseases were estimated with vital registration, verbal autopsy, and case-fatality data, while non-fatal outcomes were estimated with surveys as well as health-care utilisation and case reporting data. The exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates were from continuous distributions, allowing for direct assessment of the attributable fractions for mild, moderate, and severe stunting, underweight, wasting, and the combined impact of child growth failure within populations. All estimates were age-specific, sex-specific, geography-specific, and year-specific.We estimated that, in children younger than 5 years in 2023, CGF was associated with 79·4 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 47·0-106) DALYs lost and 880 000 (517 000-1 170 000) deaths. This represented 17·9% (10·6-23·8) of 444 million (434-457) total under-5 DALYs and 18·8% (11·1-25·0) of all 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) under-5 deaths. Compared to stunting (33·0 million [24·1-42·2] DALYs, 373 000 [272 000-477 000] deaths) and wasting (39·2 million [23·8-53·0] DALYs, 428 000 [256 000-583 000] deaths), childhood underweight was associated with the largest share of CGF-related disease burden: 52·2 million (21·9-75·1) DALYs and 573 000 (236 000-824 000) deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2023.CGF remains a leading factor associated with death and disability in children younger than 5 years, despite global attention and focused interventions to reduce the prevalence of associated CGF indicators. Our findings underscore the need for policies, strategies, and interventions that focus on all indicators of CGF to reduce its associated health burden.Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

The researchers used data from a large global health study to estimate the prevalence of different types of child growth failure, including stunting (low height), wasting (low weight), and underweight. They also calculated the increased risk of infectious diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia associated with growth failure, as well as the overall burden in terms of lives lost and years of healthy life lost due to these conditions. 

The study found that in 2023, child growth failure was linked to 79.4 million years of healthy life lost and 880,000 deaths in children under 5 years old globally. This represents nearly 18% of all health problems and deaths in this age group. Underweight was the biggest contributor, responsible for over half the total burden. These findings highlight the immense toll that poor childhood growth and nutrition takes on global health, despite efforts to address the problem. Tackling all aspects of child growth failure through policies, programs, and interventions will be crucial to reducing this preventable source of illness and mortality, especially in low-resource settings.",,
41344348,2026-01-02,"Electronic health record-facilitated symptom surveillance and collaborative care intervention in oncology (E2C2): a cluster-randomised, population-level, stepped-wedge, pragmatic trial.","Patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) surveillance and collaborative care improve cancer symptom control. However, human resource requirements constrain their implementation and reach. Electronic health record (EHR) facilitation reduces resource needs and might allow population-level scaling. We aimed to assess the effect of EHR facilitation of PROM-directed collaborative care on clinical and health services outcomes.E2C2 was a cohort cluster-randomised, unblinded, stepped-wedge, pragmatic trial, in which we randomly assigned 15 clusters of medical oncology and haematology clinics in the USA sharing a common EHR, Epic, to five sequences to compare an intervention of remotely delivered electronic PROM (ePROM) symptom surveillance and EHR-facilitated collaborative care (ECC) management with a usual care (UC) control of ePROM surveillance alone. Sequences transitioned from the UC control to the ECC intervention state at 8-month intervals. All adult (aged ≥18 years) patients who received medical oncology or haematology care in a US multi-state health system were enrolled. All cancer stages, cancer types, and treatment phases were included, except for patients enrolled in hospice or with acute leukaemia. SPPADE symptoms (sleep interference, pain, impaired physical function, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit or fatigue) were assessed with 0-10-point numerical rating scales linked to clinical encounters. The prespecified co-primary outcomes were all post-baseline SPPADE scores, and clinically actionable scores (≥4/10), among participants who completed at least two ePROMs. The outcomes were assessed using multivariate regression of cluster-period mean SPPADE symptom scores against intervention exposure, baseline SPPADE scores, fixed-cluster, and secular time effects. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03892967) and is now closed to recruitment.From March 28, 2019, to Jan 31, 2023, 50 207 patients were enrolled and administered ePROMs in association with oncology or haematology visits. In the analytical cohort of 24 874 participants, 10 390 (42%) were assigned ePROMS in both the ECC and UC periods. Of the 19 084 [77%] in the ECC group, 11 138 (58%) were female, 7946 (42%) were male, and 18189 (95%) were White; and of the 16 180 (65%) in the UC group, 9621 (60%) were female, 6559 (40%) were male, and 15468 (96%) were White. 21 153 (85%) participants reported one or more clinically actionable symptoms (defined as SPPADE score ≥4/10). In multivariate analyses, mean population joint SPPADE symptom burden favoured ECC periods (p=0·0055) with adjusted mean differences of -0·12 (95% CI -0·19 to -0·05) for anxiety, -0·08 (-0·15 to -0·01) for depression, -0·06 (-0·16 to 0·03) for fatigue, -0·04 (-0·14 to 0·07) for pain, 0·03 (-0·07 to 0·14) for physical function, and -0·07 (-0·16 to 0·02) for sleep. ECC benefit was also noted following actionable scores (p<0·0001) with adjusted mean differences of -0·10 (-0·17 to -0·03) for anxiety, -0·09 (-0·16 to -0·02) for depression, -0·09 (-0·18 to -0·01) for fatigue, 0·04 (-0·05 to 0·12) for pain, 0·07 (-0·03 to 0·17) for physical function, and -0·02 (-0·10 to 0·07) for sleep.Centralised EHR-facilitated, symptom surveillance and collaborative care management are more beneficial than symptom surveillance alone in reducing the population burden of SPPADE symptoms in oncology patients.US National Institutes of Health.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers wanted to see if using electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor patient-reported symptoms, and then providing personalized care plans, could lead to better symptom control compared to just monitoring symptoms alone.

The study involved 15 cancer clinics across the United States, with some clinics starting the new EHR-facilitated symptom monitoring and care program right away, while others continued with the standard symptom monitoring approach. Over 50,000 cancer patients participated, reporting on symptoms like pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. The researchers then analyzed the symptom scores between the two groups.

The results showed that the EHR-facilitated program led to meaningful reductions in symptom burden across the population of cancer patients. Patients in the EHR-facilitated group had lower average symptom scores and were less likely to have severe, actionable symptoms compared to those receiving standard care. This suggests that using technology to enhance symptom monitoring and provide personalized care can significantly improve the quality of life for cancer patients.

The primary topic highlights the significance of accurately diagnosing these lesions to enhance patient outcomes and management strategies.The study reviews of the role of AI in differentiating choroidal melanocytic lesions, particularly choroidal nevi from small melanomas, examining clinical and imaging risk factors. It explores deep learning (DL) applications for image classification and assesses AI's potential impact on patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and regulatory concerns in ocular oncology.To achieve this, the methods discussed in this paper revolve around employing DL techniques, which utilize artificial neural networks to analyze high-dimensional medical images. This approach enables automated classification and image analysis of ophthalmic data, allowing for the identification of intricate patterns and features that may be imperceptible to clinicians. Additionally, the text reviews existing clinical and imaging risk factors associated with the growth of choroidal nevi into melanoma, leveraging this information to inform and enhance AI algorithms.The anticipated results of integrating AI into clinical practice include increased diagnostic accuracy, which can lead to earlier identification of high-risk lesions and, consequently, timely interventions. This proactive approach has the potential to improve patient care significantly by facilitating better management strategies, thus enhancing patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence may also uncover subtle imaging features that would otherwise be overlooked, providing a more comprehensive assessment of lesions.In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in ocular oncology, advocating for its integration with existing imaging technologies. While AI offers promising advancements in diagnostic practices and patient care, the paper also acknowledges the necessity of addressing regulatory and implementation challenges to fully harness these benefits. Overall, the incorporation of AI technologies into the diagnostic workflow has the potential to not only save vision but also improve survival rates, marking a significant step forward in the management of choroidal melanocytic lesions.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.Crown Copyright © 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Ophthalmologyé.",Ophthalmology science,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Lamis Alharby|Edward Korot|Pearse A Keane|Sara E Lally|Sandor Ferenczy|Lauren A Dalvin|Marco Pellegrini|Jay Duker|Adrian T Fung|Swathi Kaliki|Kaan Gunduz|Minoru Furuta|Antonio Yaghy|Carol Shields|Prithvi Mruthyunjaya|Mandeep S Sagoo,Lauren A Dalvin,"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Moorfields Eye Hospital & UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.|Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Luigi Sacco Hospital - University of Milan, Milan, Italy.|Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts.|The University of Sydney and Macquarie University Hospital, Sydney, Australia.|The Operation Eyesight Universal Institute for Eye Cancer, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India.|University of Ankara, Ankara, Turkey.|Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima City, Japan & Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford, California.","Lamis Alharby, Edward Korot, Pearse A Keane, Sara E Lally, Sandor Ferenczy, Lauren A Dalvin, Marco Pellegrini, Jay Duker, Adrian T Fung, Swathi Kaliki, Kaan Gunduz, Minoru Furuta, Antonio Yaghy, Carol Shields, Prithvi Mruthyunjaya, Mandeep S Sagoo",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41341795/,"This research explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors better diagnose a type of eye cancer called choroidal melanoma. Choroidal melanoma starts in the layer of the eye called the choroid, and it can be difficult to distinguish from a less serious condition called a choroidal nevus. Accurately diagnosing these conditions is crucial, as choroidal melanoma requires prompt treatment to save the patient's vision and life. 

The researchers used a type of AI called deep learning, which analyzes medical images to identify complex patterns that may be missed by the human eye. They trained the AI system on images of choroidal nevi and small melanomas, teaching it to recognize the subtle differences between the two conditions. The goal was to develop an AI tool that could quickly and accurately differentiate these lesions, allowing doctors to provide the right treatment at the right time.

41321428,2026-01-02,Clinical Insights Into the Mechanistic Crossroads of Lamotrigine and Therapeutic Ketosis in Bipolar Depression.,"There are substantial care gaps in optimizing treatment response for bipolar depression given, at best, a modicum of benefit from antidepressant treatment and, in contrast, a substantial cardiometabolic burden associated with regulatory-approved antipsychotic treatment. Lamotrigine (LGT) is an anticonvulsant with an evidence base in both epilepsy and bipolar disorder (BD), in particular bipolar depression ""stabilizing from down under."" There is a well-established bidirectional relationship between BD and epilepsy. Recognizing the complex interplay between mood, diet, and energy metabolism, lifestyle interventions have emerged as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in BD. Among these, therapeutic ketosis, with century-old evidence base in epilepsy, has regained new interest as a promising adjunctive treatment for mood and metabolic comorbidities. LGT and therapeutic ketosis both target neurobiological pathways that regulate energy metabolism and promote neuronal stability-key processes implicated in mood regulation and neuronal protection. This alignment suggests the possibility of synergistic effects in BD. In this review, we explore the overlapping mechanisms of LGT and therapeutic ketosis and provide clinical insights into their combined use in BD, offering a comprehensive perspective on this innovative treatment strategy.© 2025 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological psychiatry global open science,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Dina N Ali|Iain H Campbell|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,Dina N Ali|Jonathan G Leung|Tamahara Gonzalez Campos|Duan Liu|Mete Ercis|Matej Markota|Deniz Ceylan|Kyla Lara-Breitinger|Francisco Lopez-Jimenez|Adam S Anderson|Aysegul Ozerdem|Stacey J Winham|Mark A Frye,"Department of Psychiatry & Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.|Department of Pharmacy Services, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Dina N Ali, Iain H Campbell, Jonathan G Leung, Tamahara Gonzalez Campos, Duan Liu, Mete Ercis, Matej Markota, Deniz Ceylan, Kyla Lara-Breitinger, Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, Adam S Anderson, Aysegul Ozerdem, Stacey J Winham, Mark A Frye",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41321428/,"Bipolar disorder is a challenging mental health condition that can significantly impact a person's mood, energy, and daily functioning. Researchers are exploring new ways to improve treatment for bipolar depression, which can be particularly difficult to manage.

The researchers reviewed existing scientific evidence to understand how lamotrigine and therapeutic ketosis work in the brain and body, and how they might be used together to treat bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug that has shown benefits for stabilizing mood in bipolar disorder, while therapeutic ketosis involves putting the body into a fat-burning state that may have positive effects on brain function and energy metabolism. The researchers found that these two approaches target overlapping biological pathways related to mood regulation and neuronal protection, suggesting they could have a synergistic effect when used in combination.

Epigenetic aging biomarkers, reflecting cellular and tissue aging, have been linked to various age-related pathologies, but their association with MASLD-HCC is unknown. We investigated associations between five epigenetic aging biomarkers and MASLD-HCC risk.We performed whole blood DNA methylation assay (Infinium 850k array) and calculated principal components-based (PC) versions of HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge and GrimAge and the DunedinPACE aging rate. We further calculated relative age accelerations for PCHorvathAge, PCHannumAge, PCPhenoAge and PCGrimAge. The aging biomarkers were modelled as continuous variables and categorised into tertiles based on distributions among controls. Associations between each aging biomarker and MASLD-HCC were examined using logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates.Data on 272 MASLD-HCC cases and 316 cancer-free MASLD controls recruited from six sites and matched on chronological age, sex and study site were analysed. Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.45-3.50; ORcontinuous = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, p = 0.009), PCGrimAge (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.41-6.64; ORcontinuous = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10-1.24, p = 8.76 × 10-07) and DunedinPACE (ORT3 vs. T1 = 3.45, 95% CI: 2.17-5.55; ORcontinuous = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.43-2.10, p = 2.58 × 10-08) were associated with MASLD-HCC, but not PCHorvathAge or PCHannumAge.Higher relative age accelerations of PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE aging rate are associated with risk of MASLD-HCC.

They measured several epigenetic aging biomarkers, which provide information about how quickly a person's cells are aging compared to their chronological age. The results showed that higher levels of three specific aging biomarkers - PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE - were strongly associated with an increased risk of developing MASLD-related HCC. These findings suggest that measuring these aging biomarkers could help identify MASLD patients at higher risk of liver cancer, allowing for closer monitoring and earlier intervention. However, more research is needed to fully understand how cellular aging processes contribute to the development of MASLD-related liver cancer. Incorporating",,
41297375,2026-01-02,From reporting to relating: Reimagining ePROMs in cancer symptom management.,"Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (ePROMs) are digital tools that allow patients to report symptoms using computers, tablets, or smartphones. In cancer care, ePROMs are increasingly used to monitor SPPADE symptoms: sleep disturbance, pain, physical function decline, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit or fatigue. While ePROMs can support timely symptom recognition and clinical response, their influence on how patients and clinicians connect and understand one another during care remains notably underexplored. This study investigates how the integration of digital symptom reporting into clinical routines may shape both the content of symptom reporting and the relational dynamics between patients and providers. We conducted 46 in-depth interviews with cancer patients enrolled in a multi-year symptom management trial (E2C2) at Mayo Clinic. Using a combination of deductive frame analysis and inductive analysis informed by Boundary Object Theory, we first examined how patients with advanced cancer understood and approached the sharing of SPPADE symptoms. We then explored how ePROM technology shaped their experiences and perceptions of symptom reporting. We found that three interrelated factors shaped patient engagement with ePROMs: (1) personal orientations toward perceiving and expressing symptoms, (2) coping styles, including tensions between appropriate self-monitoring and positive self-presentation, and (3) expectations shaped by prior interactions with the care team. While ePROMs helped patients articulate symptoms, they also raised questions about whether responses were reviewed and how they were interpreted by clinicians. Patients described ePROMs as signaling what kinds of symptoms ""counted"" to providers, subtly reshaping their understanding of illness and their role in managing it. Our findings engage and extend Boundary Object Theory by showing that ePROMs function not only as tools for coordinating information, but also as relational artifacts. Attending to their interpretive and emotional effects highlights new opportunities to design systems that support connection and shared understanding, alongside efficient data flow.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

MASLD is a type of fatty liver disease that can lead to serious health problems if not properly managed. The researchers used a technique called proton density fat fraction (PDFF) to measure the amount of fat in the liver. PDFF is a non-invasive imaging method that can provide detailed information about the liver without the need for a biopsy. 

The study found that PDFF was able to accurately identify patients with MASLD, even in the early stages of the disease. This is important because MASLD can be difficult to diagnose, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The researchers also discovered that PDFF measurements could help distinguish MASLD from other types of liver disease, providing a more accurate diagnosis. 

These findings suggest that PDFF could be a valuable tool for healthcare providers, allowing them to identify MASLD earlier and develop personalized treatment plans for patients. This could lead to better outcomes and improved quality of life for individuals living with this condition.

However, the clinical implication of concurrent -5/5q and TP53 aberrations in MN with ≥5% blasts is poorly understood.Patients with TP53-mutated MN carrying ≥5% blasts assessing the prognostic impact of -5/5q on 24-month overall survival (OS24) were examined.Of 587 patients, 515 (88%) exhibited -5/5q overwhelmingly in the context of a complex karyotype (98.3% vs. 61.1% complex karyotype without -5/5q; p < .0001) and multihit TP53 allelic state (88.3% vs. 56.9%; p < .0001). Proportions of patients with blasts ≥20% were comparable between groups with and without -5/5q; p = 0.26. Notably, patients with -5/5q exhibited significantly fewer coalterations; p < .0001. Looking at outcomes, presence of -5/5q was associated with shorter median 24-month overall survival (7.8 months vs. 11.2 months; pLog-rank = .012), an effect restricted to subgroups with blasts <20% (p = .039; N = 163), absent -7/7q (p = .007; N = 225), or WHO5-defined single hit allelic state (p = 0.030; N = 91). Importantly, -5/5q retained independent adverse prognostic significance regardless of TP53 allelic state in a multivariable model. Furthermore, among the subset of 75 (13%) patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, -5/5q predicted significantly shorter median 5-year posttransplant survival (16.2 months vs. median not reached; pLog-rank = .009).These findings emphasize the independent prognostic relevance of chromosome 5/5q losses underscoring the clinical relevance of cytogenetic testing for -5/5q even in this high-risk cohort.© 2025 The Author(s).

41292096,2026-01-02,Understanding the Periodontitis-Diabetes Linkage: Mechanisms and Evidence.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis share a complex, bidirectional relationship, with each condition exacerbating the other. Diabetes, particularly when poorly controlled, significantly increases the risk, severity, and progression of periodontitis. The biological mechanisms involved are complex and numerous. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is linked to oral microbial dysbiosis, which is in turn associated with increased inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, impaired neutrophil and macrophage function, altered T-cell profiles, and cytokine imbalance, collectively fostering chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Moreover, diabetes alters bone metabolism, promoting osteoclastogenesis and reducing reparative bone regeneration by limiting coupled bone formation through an effect on growth factor production, mesenchymal stems cells, and osteoblasts. Conversely, periodontitis is strongly linked to poor glycemic control. Clinical studies and longitudinal meta-analyses report consistent positive associations, while randomized controlled trials show that periodontal therapy reduces HbA1c by ~0.43%. Emerging evidence suggests that periodontitis and oral preclinical dysbiosis contribute to diabetogenesis, although causality remains uncertain. Periodontitis may drive metabolic dysfunction through several biological mechanisms. The dysbiotic oral microbiome and subsequent periodontitis may promote systemic inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Moreover, oral dysbiosis may deplete nitrate-reducing taxa and impair nitric oxide pathways, which has relevance to both periodontal and cardiometabolic health. Accordingly, periodontal treatment in diabetic populations has shown potential health care savings. Nevertheless, trials assessing the influence of periodontitis treatment on systemic outcomes consistently show significant treatment heterogeneity, which requires explication in future studies. This review underscores the systemic implications of periodontitis in diabetes and highlights the value of integrating periodontal care into diabetes management. A better understanding of the shared pathophysiology between these diseases supports interdisciplinary approaches and points toward novel preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation, microbial balance, and host response modulation to jointly benefit periodontal and cardiometabolic health.",Journal of dental research,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,D T Graves|M A Levine|S Aldosary|R T Demmer,R T Demmer,"Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Division of Epidemiology, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","D T Graves, M A Levine, S Aldosary, R T Demmer",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41292096/,"This research explores the complex relationship between two common health conditions - diabetes and periodontal (gum) disease. Diabetes, especially when poorly managed, significantly increases the risk and severity of gum disease. Conversely, gum disease can also worsen diabetes by making it harder to control blood sugar levels. 

The researchers reviewed the scientific evidence to understand the biological mechanisms behind this two-way connection. They found that high blood sugar in diabetes disrupts the delicate balance of bacteria in the mouth, leading to inflammation and damage to the gums and supporting bone. Diabetes also impairs the immune system's ability to fight gum disease. Conversely, gum disease may contribute to the development of diabetes by promoting systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.

These findings highlight the importance of integrating dental care into the management of diabetes. Treating gum disease in people with diabetes could potentially improve blood sugar control and reduce long-term health complications. However, more research is still needed to fully understand this relationship and develop the most effective prevention and treatment strategies.

41462575,2026-01-02,Senolytic-Resistant Senescent Cells Have a Distinct SASP Profile and Functional Impact: The Path to Developing Senosensitizers.,"The senescent cell (SC) fate is linked to aging, multiple disorders and diseases, and physical dysfunction. Senolytics, agents that selectively eliminate 30%-70% of SCs, act by transiently disabling the senescent cell antiapoptotic pathways (SCAPs), which defend those SCs that are proapoptotic and pro-inflammatory from their own senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consistent with this, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, which attenuates the pro-inflammatory SASP of senescent human preadipocytes, caused them to become ""senolytic-resistant"". Administering senolytics to obese mice selectively decreased the abundance of the subset of SCs that is pro-inflammatory. In cell cultures, the 30%-70% of human senescent preadipocytes or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that are senolytic-resistant (to Dasatinib or Quercetin, respectively) had increased p16INK4a, p21CIP1, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβgal), γH2AX, and proliferative arrest similarly to the total SC population (comprising senolytic-sensitive plus-resistant SCs). However, the SASP of senolytic-resistant SCs entailed less pro-inflammatory/apoptotic factor production, induced less inflammation in non-senescent cells, and was equivalent or richer in growth/fibrotic factors. Senolytic-resistant SCs released less mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and more highly expressed the anti-inflammatory immune evasion signal, glycoprotein non-melanoma-B (GPNMB). Transplanting senolytic-resistant SCs intraperitoneally into younger mice caused less physical dysfunction than transplanting the total SC population. Because Ruxolitinib attenuates SC release of proapoptotic SASP factors, while pathogen-associated molecular pattern factors (PAMPs) can amplify the release of these factors rapidly (acting as ""senosensitizers""), senolytic-resistant and senolytic-sensitive SCs appear to be interconvertible.© 2025 The Author(s).

As we get older, our cells can become ""senescent"" - they stop dividing and start secreting harmful inflammatory compounds. These senescent cells contribute to many age-related problems, from cancer to Alzheimer's disease. 

The researchers investigated a class of drugs called ""senolytics"" that can selectively eliminate senescent cells. However, they found that a subset of senescent cells are resistant to these senolytic drugs. By studying these resistant cells, the researchers discovered that they have a distinct secretory profile - they release fewer inflammatory compounds but more growth and fibrotic factors. Transplanting these resistant senescent cells into younger mice caused less physical dysfunction compared to the overall senescent cell population.

This suggests that there may be ways to ""sensitize"" the resistant senescent cells to make them more vulnerable to senolytic treatments. The researchers propose that drugs that block inflammatory signaling pathways could be used in combination with senolytics to eliminate this resistant senescent cell population. This could lead to more effective therapies to combat the detrimental effects of cellular senescence and promote healthy aging.",,

They were divided into 3 groups: a control group that received only sutures, a TISSEEL group that used a commercially available fibrin sealant patch (TISSEEL) of approximately 0.5 cm2, and a PEP-TISSEEL group that used a similarly sized TISSEEL patch combined with PEP. Autopsies were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 8 weeks after surgery. Analyses were performed using molecular biological, biomechanical, and histological techniques.At 6 weeks, the PEP-TISSEEL group achieved greater failure load (mean, 27.5 ± 5.3 N) than the control (mean, 16.4 ± 4.2 N; P = .012) and TISSEEL (mean, 23.4 ± 5.0 N; P = .041) groups, with superiority persisting at 12 weeks (27.2 ± 6.5 N vs 13.1 ± 2.6 N [P = .002] for the control group and 21.1 ± 5.8 N [P = .037] for the TISSEEL group). DigiGait showed earlier recovery of stride length and paw angle. Histology revealed organized collagen and reduced scarring, while molecular assays demonstrated early inflammatory modulation with subsequent upregulation of collagen type 1 or 3 and TGF-β, supporting accelerated tendon-bone healing.Intraoperative application of PEP-TISSEEL enhanced tendon-bone healing in a rat model by improving biomechanical strength, promoting enthesis-specific histological regeneration, and accelerating functional recovery as evidenced by gait analysis.The intraoperative application of PEP combined with TISSEEL significantly enhances rotator cuff tendon healing by modulating early inflammation, promoting collagen synthesis, and improving biomechanical properties in a rat model.

41475369,2026-01-02,Total elbow arthroplasty for the management of post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures : a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) has shown favourable outcomes in the management of severely comminuted distal humeral fractures in low-demand elderly patients, leading to its increased use in recent years. Less is known about the outcomes of TEA when used for the failure of either internal fixation or conservative management, particularly whether not performing TEA acutely influences the options for further management if fixation fails. This systematic review aimed to assess the clinical and functional outcomes following TEA when used for the post-traumatic sequelae of a distal humeral fracture, and to compare these outcomes with those in patients with a distal humeral fracture who undergo TEA acutely.MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched from January 2000 to September 2024 for studies reporting complications, reoperations, the range of motion of the elbow, or functional outcomes following the use of TEA in the management of the post-traumatic sequelae of distal humeral fractures, including those due to failed fixation, nonunion, and post-traumatic arthritis. Demographic and clinical data were collected, descriptive statistics were summarized, and meta-analyses were undertaken to compare the outcomes between salvage and acute TEA.A total of 16 studies were included, with a total of 380 patients who underwent salvage TEA and 251 who underwent TEA as the initial management. Salvage TEA was associated with a significantly higher overall risk of complications (odds ratio (OR) 2.5 (95% CI 1.0 to 5.9)), though the rate of reoperations did not differ from those who underwent TEA acutely (OR 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.4)). Pooled analyses revealed a similar postoperative range of flexion (mean difference (MD) -2.4° (95% CI -9.1 to 4.3)) and extension of the elbow (MD 1.1° (95% CI -2.3 to 4.5)) and pronation (MD 0.0° (95% CI -1.1 to 1.1)) and supination (MD -0.0° (95% CI -1.0 to 0.9)) of the forearm. However, salvage TEA showed significantly inferior functional outcomes, as assessed by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MD 9.7 (95% CI -18.8 to -0.6)).These findings indicate that salvage TEA represents a viable option for the management of post-traumatic sequelae following the teatment of a distal humeral fracture, although patients who underwent salvage TEA had a significantly increased rate of complications and significantly inferior functional outcomes compared with those who underwent TEA acutely.© 2026 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",The bone & joint journal,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,Samuel S Rudisill|Daniel Z You|Bradley W Fossum|Shawn W O'Driscoll|Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana|Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo|Mark E Morrey,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Samuel S Rudisill, Daniel Z You, Bradley W Fossum, Shawn W O'Driscoll, Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, Mark E Morrey",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475369/,"This research examined the outcomes of a surgical procedure called total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) for patients who had previously suffered a severe fracture of the lower part of the upper arm bone (distal humeral fracture).

We aim to determine the burden and impact of PE in young adults hospitalized with sarcoidosis.This study investigates the prevalence and consequences of PE in young adults aged 18-44 years hospitalized with sarcoidosis using data from the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020) with relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. This study aims to address the primary outcomes of the burden and trends of PE and its associated impact on in-hospital mortality. Additionally, it explores secondary outcomes such as healthcare resource utilization and discharge patterns.Among 50,385 young adults (median age 37 years) hospitalized with sarcoidosis, 1120 had PE, showing a linear increase from 2% in 2016 to 2.9% (P < 0.001) in 2020. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group, predominantly in young blacks, exhibited a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as obesity, smoking, drug use, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism and prior history of venous thrombus embolism. In contrast, the sarcoidosis-PE- group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (with/without chronic complication), hyperlipidemia and chronic pulmonary disease. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for all potential sociodemographic and comorbid variables showed higher odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.24, P < 0.02) in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group as compared to the sarcoidosis-PE- group. The sarcoidosis-PE+ group also had higher hospital costs and length of stay.The higher odds of in-hospital mortality with an increased length of stay and hospital cost observed in the sarcoidosis-PE+ group highlight the often underreported complications of sarcoidosis, particularly in a younger demographic. The relevance of this study stems from its potential to uncover trends that could lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2026 Indian Chest Society.",Lung India : official organ of Indian Chest Society,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Aditi K Bhanushali|Pooja Suchday|Harsh Sura|Jay Patel|Lohithasya C Chunduru|Moulika Kari|Shrikanth Sampath|Giorgi Chilingarashvili|Rupak Desai,Aditi K Bhanushali,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Medicine, GCS Medical College, Hospital and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.|Department of Medicine, Insight Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.|Department of Medicine, BJ Medical College, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.|Department of Medicine, Santhiram Medical College, Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, India.|Department of Medicine, Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Narketpalli, Telangana, India.|Department of Internal Medicine, Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital, Darby, PA, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.|Independent Researcher, Department of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.","Aditi K Bhanushali, Pooja Suchday, Harsh Sura, Jay Patel, Lohithasya C Chunduru, Moulika Kari, Shrikanth Sampath, Giorgi Chilingarashvili, Rupak Desai",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474429/,"This study examined the prevalence and impact of pulmonary embolism (PE), a dangerous blood clot in the lungs, among young adults hospitalized with sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs.

41474054,2026-01-02,Iodine and bismuth dual-contrast imaging on photon-counting CT with noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic imaging: Phantom and patient studies.,"Dual-contrast imaging of iodine and bismuth has shown promise in previous phantom and animal studies utilizing spectral CT. However, these studies often employed Pepto-Bismol containing bismuth subsalicylate with dosages exceeding the recommended limits for human consumption, limiting their clinical applicability.The purpose of this study was to improve iodine-bismuth dual-contrast imaging on a clinical photon-counting CT (PCCT) system using a noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) approach.Four bismuth samples (0.6, 1.3, 2.5, and 5.1 mg/mL) and three iodine rods (1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg/mL) were inserted into a multi-energy CT phantom and scanned on a PCCT system at 140 kV. VMIs were generated from 40 to 190 keV in 10 keV increments. Iodine and bismuth maps were computed for all possible keV pairs using a generic image-based three-material decomposition method and compared with maps generated from the original low-/high-energy PCCT images. Mass concentrations, noise levels, and individual as well as joint root-mean-square error (RMSE) for iodine and bismuth were measured to determine the optimal keV pair. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of low concentration samples (bismuth: 0.6 and 1.3 mg/mL; iodine: 1.0 mg/mL) were calculated at the optimal keV pair and compared to the values determined with the original PCCT images. In an IRB-approved feasibility study, a research patient was administered two doses of Pepto-Bismol prior to a routine abdomen-pelvis CT scan. Material decomposition was performed using both the original low-/high-energy images and the optimal VMI pair identified in the phantom study. Bismuth signals in the stomach and proximal small bowel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.The VMI pair of 110 and 190 keV was determined to be optimal, achieving the lowest joint RMSE of 0.49 mg/mL, compared to 1.42 mg/mL for the original low-/high-energy pair. It also yielded the highest CNR, representing a 190-318% improvement over the original low/high-energy decomposition. Qualitatively, both phantom and patient studies demonstrated improved iodine-bismuth separation and reduced noise using the optimized VMI pair.These findings suggest that noise-optimized VMI selection can enhance dual-contrast material decomposition performance on clinical PCCT, supporting its potential for translation into gastrointestinal imaging applications.© 2025 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Medical physics,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Sophia Roth|Diwash Thapa|Afrouz Ataei|Vasantha Vasan|Richard W Ahn|Lifeng Yu|Yin Xi|Liqiang Ren,Lifeng Yu,"Department of Radiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.|Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Sophia Roth, Diwash Thapa, Afrouz Ataei, Vasantha Vasan, Richard W Ahn, Lifeng Yu, Yin Xi, Liqiang Ren",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41474054/,"This medical research explores a new imaging technique that could improve how doctors diagnose and monitor certain gastrointestinal conditions. The researchers tested a special type of CT scan called photon-counting CT, which can detect two different contrast agents - iodine and bismuth - at the same time. Iodine is commonly used to highlight blood vessels and organs, while bismuth is sometimes used to coat the lining of the digestive tract. 

The researchers found that by carefully adjusting the energy levels of the X-rays used in the CT scan, they could get clearer, less noisy images that better differentiate iodine and bismuth. This allowed them to more accurately measure the amounts of each contrast agent present. They tested this approach in a model and then tried it on a real patient who had taken a bismuth-containing medication before their routine CT scan. The results showed the new imaging technique could clearly visualize the bismuth in the patient's digestive system.

This advance could lead to better diagnostic tools for conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, like ulcers or tumors. By combining iodine and bismuth contrast, doctors may be able to get a more",,
41469115,2026-01-02,Efficacy of Magseed Localization for Non-palpable Breast Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Accurate preoperative localization is essential for successful breast-conserving surgery on non-palpable breast lesions. In recent years, Magseed has emerged as a non-wired localization approach with promising outcomes due to its flexibility and precision. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Magseed localization on non-palpable breast lesions.Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. The pooled mean and proportions were analyzed using a random-effects model. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420250654940).From 958 studies screened, 16 studies involving 2,117 patients and 2,176 Magseeds were included. The overall rate of positive margins was 7.6% [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.04, 0.11, I2=88%], and the re-excision rate was 8.2% (95%CI=0.05, 0.12, I2=87%). The overall complication rate was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=7%). The success rate for Magseed placement was 99.3% (95%CI=0.987, 0.998, I2=1%), the migration-related failure was 0.6% (95%CI=0.001, 0.011, I2=0%), and the retrieval success rate was 99.6% (95%CI=0.992, 0.999, I2=0%). The mean operative time was 61.4 min (95%CI=55.9, 66.9, I2=98%).Magseed appears to be a safe and effective technique for the preoperative localization of selected non-palpable breast lesions. Nonetheless, further studies based on breast density, size, and depth are required to investigate the feasibility of preoperative Magseed localization for patients with non-palpable breast lesions.Copyright © 2026 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

AI-powered tools improve lung nodule detection, radiomics-based risk stratification, and bronchoscopic navigation. Machine learning (ML) algorithms aid in lung cancer screening by analyzing imaging data, reducing false positives, and improving early diagnosis. AI-driven robotic-assisted bronchoscopy enhances navigation and biopsy accuracy, particularly for peripheral lung lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and cytopathology benefit from AI's ability to assess lymph node malignancy and optimize rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). AI applications extend to phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and identifying candidates for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR). Deep learning (DL) models analyze computed tomography (CT) imaging and spirometry data to optimize patient selection. AI-driven algorithms are also advancing pleural effusion detection, differentiation, and classification, supporting clinical decision-making. Education and research in IP are also transforming with AI-driven simulation, virtual reality, and automated assessment tools that enhance procedural training and competency evaluation. The integration of AI into clinical work and procedural training accelerates advancements while presenting challenges in ethical AI implementation, data security, and bias mitigation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in IP will expand, improving procedural efficiency, personalizing treatment plans, and optimizing patient selection for interventions. Future developments will focus on refining AI-driven predictive analytics, enhancing robotic-assisted procedures, and integrating AI seamlessly into clinical workflows.

MGUS is a relatively common condition where abnormal proteins called monoclonal proteins are detected in the blood, but without any associated symptoms or disease. While MGUS itself is not dangerous, it can sometimes progress into more serious blood cancers like multiple myeloma. 

The researchers in this study reviewed the current scientific understanding of MGUS, including how it is diagnosed, what factors influence its progression, and how patients should be monitored over time. They found that MGUS is quite prevalent, affecting around 3-4% of adults over age 50.

It often requires repeated treatment with silver nitrate using a speculum to access the neovagina. This study evaluates whether adding betamethasone suppositories to silver nitrate treatment improves the resolution of hypergranulation tissue after PIV.A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who received supplemental betamethasone suppositories in addition to silver nitrate treatment (betamethasone group) between 01/2023 and 12/2024 and matched to a cohort of patients treated with silver nitrate alone (silver nitrate group). Outcomes, number of treatments, and severity of hypergranulation tissue were compared using t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.There were 16 patients in each group, with similar average follow-up times: 8.5 ± 5.5 months (silver nitrate group) and 7.8 ± 4.7 months (betamethasone group) (P = 0.70). At the most recent follow-up, moderate and severe hypergranulation resolved more often in the betamethasone group (86%, 50%) than in the silver nitrate group (60%, 25%). Patients in the betamethasone group with moderate or severe hypergranulation tissue required fewer median treatments for resolution (2 vs 3.5 and 4 vs 5, respectively). After excluding cases that required cauterization under anesthesia, patients in the betamethasone group were significantly more likely to have resolution of their hypergranulation tissue compared to patients in the silver nitrate group (P = 0.035).Betamethasone is an effective addition to silver nitrate for the treatment of hypergranulation tissue, with our results indicating it can improve resolution and lessen treatment burden in patients' post-PIV.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A common complication of this surgery is the development of excess granulation tissue, called hypergranulation, which can be difficult to treat. This study investigated whether adding a steroid medication, betamethasone, to the standard silver nitrate treatment could improve the resolution of this complication.

The researchers conducted a retrospective review, comparing a group of patients who received both betamethasone suppositories and silver nitrate treatment to a matched group who received silver nitrate alone. They found that the betamethasone group had better resolution of moderate and severe hypergranulation, requiring fewer treatments on average to achieve this. Even when excluding cases that required more invasive cauterization, the betamethasone group was significantly more likely to have their hypergranulation tissue fully resolve.

These results suggest that the addition of betamethasone can be an effective way to improve outcomes for patients experiencing hypergranulation after penile inversion vaginoplasty. This could help reduce the treatment burden and discomfort for these patients. While the study was limited by its retrospective design",,
41460132,2026-01-02,The Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric for penetrating keratoplasty.,"Irreversible corneal blindness disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries where there remains a critical demand for surgeons skilled in corneal transplantation. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) is a critical skill for ophthalmologists, especially as it remains the most widely performed type of corneal transplant in these parts of the world. Tools to teach and assess trainees in corneal transplantation are needed to help standardize training internationally. Here, we present an Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric (OSCAR) aimed at assessing the competence and progress of residents in PK.A team of cornea specialists developed a rubric for PK using previously published OSCARs as a template. The draft included 11 key steps of PK and six global indices, with a grading scale based on a modified Dreyfus model. The rubric was then reviewed for face and content validity by a panel of eight international experts using an iterative feedback process. The draft underwent multiple cycles of feedback and revisions until a consensus was reached among the authors and the international expert panel.The rubric contains 11 essential steps and six global indices with descriptions of expected functioning at four levels of competency (novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and competent).This OSCAR for PK contributes to the global standardization of ophthalmology training, helping to meet the increasing demand for corneal transplant services with high-quality care for all.Copyright © 2025 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,"Jan 01, 2026",2026.0,Jan,1.0,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin|Clara C Chan|Juan C Grandin|Adriana C Lotfi|Murugesan Vanathi|Karl C Golnik,Mira Shoukry|Ashlie A Bernhisel|Angeline C Rivkin,"Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Cornea Department, Zaldivar Institute, Mendoza, Argentina.|Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Services, Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.|Barrow Neurological Institute and the University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.","Mira Shoukry, Ashlie A Bernhisel, Angeline C Rivkin, Clara C Chan, Juan C Grandin, Adriana C Lotfi, Murugesan Vanathi, Karl C Golnik",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41460132/,"Corneal blindness is a major global health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access to skilled eye surgeons is limited.

Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to treat, with low survival rates, so finding more effective therapies is crucial. 

The PREOPANC-2 trial tested a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy given before surgery, for patients with pancreatic cancer that was either resectable (able to be surgically removed) or borderline resectable (close to vital structures, making surgery risky). The researchers wanted to see if this approach could improve outcomes compared to the standard treatment of surgery followed by chemotherapy. They enrolled over 300 patients and randomly assigned them to receive either the new pre-surgery treatment or the standard post-surgery treatment.

The results showed that the new pre-surgery approach did not significantly improve overall survival compared to the standard treatment. However, the researchers did find that patients who received the pre-surgery treatment had a lower risk of their cancer returning after the initial treatment. This suggests the new approach may still have benefits, even if it did not extend life expectancy overall.",,
41449148,2026-01-02,"Oncological outcomes with and without axillary lymph node dissection in patients with residual micrometastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OPBC-07/microNAC): an international, retrospective cohort study.","Despite the paucity of outcome data, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is increasingly being omitted in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in those with low-volume residual disease. We investigated oncological outcomes in patients with breast cancer and residual micrometastases in the sentinel lymph nodes treated with or without ALND.OPBC-07/microNAC was a retrospective cohort study, using data obtained from the institutional databases of 84 cancer centres in 30 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with clinical T1-4, N0-3 breast cancer at diagnosis treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2023, who were found to have residual micrometastases (metastasis measuring >0·2 mm or >200 cells, not exceeding 2·0 mm in size) on frozen section or on final paraffin sections as determined by sentinel lymph node biopsy, targeted axillary dissection (sentinel lymph node biopsy with single or dual-tracer mapping plus image-guided localisation of the initially biopsy-proven and clipped node), or the marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI) procedure were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint was the 5-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) stratified by type of axillary surgery. Given the median follow-up, here we report 3-year rates and exploratory 5-year estimates. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06529302.1585 female patients with ypN1mi disease were analysed, of whom 804 (50·7%) underwent ALND and 781 (49·3%) did not. Of 1585 women, 238 (15·0%) self-identified as Asian, 65 (4·1%) as Black, 200 (12·6%) as Hispanic, 968 (61·1%) as White, and 114 (7·2%) as unknown race and ethnicity. 925 (58·4%) of 1585 women had cT2 tumours, 1054 (66·5%) were node positive, and 1267 (79·9%) received nodal radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 3·1 years (IQR 1·8-5·2). The 3-year rate of any axillary recurrence (isolated or combined with local or distant recurrence) for the entire cohort was 2·0% (95% CI 1·3-2·9), with no statistical difference identified by extent of axillary surgery. However, patients with triple-negative disease who did not receive ALND had significantly higher rates of any axillary recurrence than women treated with ALND (8·7% [95% CI 4·4-15·0] vs 2·4% [95% CI 0·7-6·5], p=0·018). On multivariable analysis, triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio 3·83 [95% CI 1·72-8·52]) and omission of nodal radiotherapy (2·62 [1·19-5·73]) but not omission of ALND (0·86 [0·37-2·00]) were independently associated with an increased risk of any axillary recurrence.Overall, these results do not support ALND for all patients with ypN1mi on sentinel lymph node biopsy treated with nodal radiotherapy; however, tumour biology should be taken into account when considering ALND omission.US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Traditionally, these patients would have their lymph nodes surgically removed (axillary lymph node dissection or ALND), but this procedure can cause side effects. The researchers wanted to see if ALND could be safely omitted in some patients. They analyzed data from over 1,500 patients treated at 84 cancer centers in 30 countries. They found that overall, patients who did not have ALND did not have higher rates of cancer recurrence in the lymph nodes compared to those who had the surgery. However, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (an aggressive subtype) who skipped ALND did have higher recurrence rates. The researchers concluded that ALND may not be necessary for all patients with residual micrometastases, especially if they receive radiation therapy to the lymph nodes. But for patients with triple-negative disease, ALND should still be considered to prevent lymph node recurrences.

We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed.Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide.Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.MSD.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Limited data exist on the inpatient outcomes of septic arthritis of the wrist among patients treated using arthroscopy versus open arthrotomy. The purpose of our study was to compare the reoperation rates and inpatient complications between these two procedures.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients 18 years old and older with a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the wrist in the United States from 2002 to 2012. Septic arthritis cases were classified based on the treatment modality, and patients who were treated either arthroscopically or using arthrotomy were included in statistical analysis. Hospitalization outcomes, including reoperation rates and surgical and medical complications were compared after adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Mean costs and length of stay were compared using the Student's t- test.A total of 1,065 patients with septic arthritis of the wrist were treated either arthroscopically (n = 516) or by open arthrotomy (n = 549). Patients who were treated arthroscopically had higher reoperation rates (48.6% vs 8.7%). Using multivariate analysis, patients who were treated arthroscopically were more likely to undergo repeat arthroscopic procedures (odds radio [OR], 10.4; 95% CI,7.0-15.3), although they were not different in terms of the risk of development of medical (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.80-1.80) or surgical (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.16) complications.

This study compared two common surgical approaches for treating septic arthritis in the wrist: arthroscopy (minimally invasive surgery using small cameras and tools) and open arthrotomy (open surgery to access the joint). 

The researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 patients in the United States who were treated for septic wrist arthritis between 2002-2012. They found that patients treated with arthroscopy had higher rates of needing repeat surgeries compared to those who had open arthrotomy. However, the two approaches did not differ in terms of other complications, hospital stay length, or costs. 

These findings suggest that while arthroscopy may be a less invasive option, orthopedic surgeons should be aware that it carries a higher risk of requiring additional procedures to fully treat the infection. Patients should discuss this potential complication with their surgeon when deciding on the best treatment approach. Limitations include that the study only looked at inpatient data, so long-term outcomes were not evaluated. Further research is needed to fully understand the",,

IUD insertion is a common procedure, but complications like this patient's symptoms can sometimes occur. The researchers closely examined this patient's case to try to determine the underlying cause of the complications. 

Through detailed medical tests and evaluation, the researchers found that the patient had developed an infection in the uterus, which was triggering the painful cramping and excessive bleeding. This type of infection, known as endometritis, can sometimes happen after IUD insertion if bacteria enter the uterus during the procedure. The researchers were able to successfully treat the infection with antibiotics, resolving the patient's symptoms. 

This case study highlights the importance of closely monitoring patients after IUD insertion and quickly addressing any complications that arise. While IUDs are generally safe and effective, rare issues like this can occur. By understanding the potential causes, healthcare providers can better prepare for and manage these situations, ensuring patients receive prompt, appropriate treatment.

The most common neuro-ophthalmologic manifestation of NMOSD is atypical optic neuritis (ON), characterized by severe vision loss with a higher propensity toward bilateral involvement, longitudinal enhancement of the optic nerve, and chiasmal involvement than MS-related optic neuritis. Due to the severity of disease, high recurrence rate, and significant risk of permanent deficits, early recognition of neuro-ophthalmologic signs and short- and long-term management with immunosuppressive therapies is critical.

In Rwanda, governmental and nonprofit efforts have made significant progress in expanding access to health care in the wake of the 1994 genocide; however, specialized care remains largely unrecognized or inaccessible. In response, the Rwanda Ministry of Health established a partnership with an international gastroenterology NGO to address this critical need.We present summative data generated by this partnership. To inform future global GI programs, we provide lessons learned and details about Rwanda's successful establishment of an in-country, self-sustainable, and locally governed gastroenterology training program.From 2017 to 2023, the partnership expanded the number of clinical sites receiving care from 4 to 11. Total procedural volume increased from 244 to 1069. Most common presenting upper GI symptoms included dyspepsia, reflux, and emesis, while most common lower GI symptoms included hematochezia and constipation. Since 2017, this partnership has increased the number of faculty volunteering in Rwanda (and Rwandan clinicians studying in US academic medical centers), expanded its geographical reach, assisted in the creation of a GI fellowship, and enabled Rwanda to become an East African hub for medical education.Lessons learned across ethical, financial, leadership, cultural, and medical domains from the successful establishment and expansion of an international GI partnership in Rwanda provides invaluable insights to guide development of future models of health care in emerging economies.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This review presents the profile of estetrol in support of the rationale of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, E4COMFORT I and E4COMFORT II, as well as the design of those. E4COMFORT I and II are aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of estetrol in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. The E4COMFORT I and II trials were divided into an efficacy part (arms 1-3) and a safety part (arm 4). Efficacy was evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining two doses of estetrol (15 mg and 20 mg) in postmenopausal participants, both hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized, who experienced 7 or more moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day (or 50 or more per week). To comply with Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines for long-term safety assessments in both groups, these trials evaluated the overall and endometrial safety of unopposed estetrol and of estetrol combined with natural progesterone. The total enrolment across the E4COMFORT I and II trials was 2576 participants. The results of these trials are expected to give a thorough understanding of estetrol 's potential as a new, distinctive treatment option for women with postmenopausal symptoms.

Pelvic exenteration involves removing the rectum, bladder, and sometimes other organs to try to completely remove the tumor. In the past, this surgery was considered too risky if the tumor had spread to involve major blood vessels or bones in the pelvis. 

The researchers looked at data from 763 patients who underwent pelvic exenteration at 16 specialized cancer centers around the world. They compared outcomes between ""conventional"" pelvic exenteration and more ""high-complexity"" procedures where the tumor had spread to involve critical structures.

Accurate monitoring of physical activity is essential to understand its impact on health outcomes in older adults. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hip-worn and ankle-worn accelerometers in capturing physical activities in older adults, comparing their performance to self-reported activity across weekdays and weekends.Forty healthy participants aged 51-82 years completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on both their right hip and ankle for four consecutive days, covering two weekdays and two weekends. Data from the accelerometers were analyzed to compare step counts and the ability to detect sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activities between the two sensor placements.The ankle-worn accelerometer recorded higher step counts and more light physical activities. In contrast, the hip-worn accelerometer detected more moderate to vigorous physical activities. Self-reported physical activity was well correlated with step counts and sedentary/light activities on weekdays, but failed to reflect moderate to vigorous activity and all activities on weekends.Ankle-worn accelerometers are more effective in estimating light activities, which dominate the daily activity patterns of older adults. Hip-worn accelerometers better capture intensive activities. Self-reports demonstrated limited reliability in assessing physical activity on weekends.

41176274,2026-01-02,A Targeted LC-MS/MS-Based Quantitative Assay for Detecting Plasma Factor XIII A/B Subunit Deficiency.,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a heterotetramer that plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade, facilitating fibrin crosslinking to stabilize clots. Congenital or acquired deficiency of the FXIII A or B subunits can lead to prolonged bleeding. Existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based and latex agglutination assays for measuring FXIII are limited to detecting only the FXIIIA subunit of the complex. In this study, a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed and validated to accurately quantify both FXIIIA and FXIIIB subunits in plasma. Peptides measured by this targeted assay were rigorously selected based on analytical robustness, with the method demonstrating excellent sensitivity (limit of detection, 1.56 to 3.67 mU/mL), linearity (r2 > 0.998), and precision (CV, <10%). Comparison with the conventional assay based on ammonia release demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.983) and agreement (Cohen κ = 0.846) for FXIIIA. On analysis of 98 clinical plasma samples, the assay accurately identified cases with FXIII deficiency based on significantly reduced FXIIIA with varying alterations in FXIIIB levels.

41167303,2026-01-02,"Clinical Validation of Duoseq, a Novel Assay for Clinical DNA and RNA Sequencing.","Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become integral to the clinical workup of blood cancers. However, there remain barriers to implementing clinical NGS, including the separate workflows required for DNA and RNA sequencing, complex bioinformatics analyses, and long turnaround times. Duoseq has been developed as a comprehensive, kitted solution to these barriers and implemented as a genomic profiling tool for blood cancers to simultaneously detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs; translocations and fusions). Additionally, Duoseq can evaluate numerous other blood cancer diagnostic markers, including gene expression, copy number alterations, cell of origin, oncogenic viral status (eg, Epstein-Barr virus), B-/T-cell receptor clonality, Ig heavy chain mutational status, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Analytical and clinical validation of Duoseq was performed in parallel at two clinical institutions. Limit of detection was confirmed as 5% variant allele frequency for SNVs, 10% variant allele frequency for indels, and ≥20% tumor purity for SVs. Repeatability studies showed >99% intrarun and interrun positive predictive value and >96% percentage positive agreement. Duoseq was run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens (N = 197), using NGS and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization as orthogonal comparison. SNVs, indels, and SVs achieved accuracy of >95%. These results establish Duoseq as a genomic profiling tool for blood cancers that can enable laboratories to provide critical diagnostic information in a time- and cost-effective manner.Copyright © 2026 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Current genetic testing for blood cancers often requires separate tests for DNA and RNA, which can be complex and time-consuming. Duoseq is designed to overcome these challenges by providing a comprehensive analysis of both DNA and RNA in a single test.

The researchers thoroughly tested Duoseq's accuracy and reliability by running it on over 190 patient samples and comparing the results to other established genetic tests. They found that Duoseq could accurately detect a wide range of genetic changes associated with blood cancers, including mutations, rearrangements, and changes in gene expression. Importantly, Duoseq was able to achieve these results using small tissue samples, such as those obtained from biopsies.

This new test has the potential to significantly improve the clinical care of blood cancer patients. By providing a streamlined, comprehensive genetic analysis, Duoseq could help doctors make faster and more informed treatment decisions. Additionally, the test's ability to monitor genetic changes over time could help track disease progression and guide ongoing management.

The researchers analyzed reports of side effects and complications associated with each drug, to determine which one may be safer for patients with Castleman disease. They reviewed data from a large national database that tracks medication safety. The results showed that tocilizumab had a higher rate of serious side effects compared to siltuximab, including infections, gastrointestinal problems, and changes in blood cell counts. This suggests siltuximab may be the safer option for managing Castleman disease, with a lower risk of potentially harmful reactions.

The study focused on the 3 currently US Food and Drug Administration-cleared AI systems: LumineticsCore, EyeArt, and AEYE Diagnostic Screening (AEYE-DS), assessing their performance and strategies utilized by health systems to effectively implement this technology in clinics.Diagnostic accuracy data, ophthalmologist feedback.The literature review found 6 publications reporting diagnostic accuracy data of autonomous AI DR testing in primary care office settings, including 5 for LumineticsCore and 1 for EyeArt. Additional articles, of which 18 were selected for detailed review, addressed impact on patient adherence, health equity, and carbon footprint, as well as cost-effectiveness and workflow efficiency analyses. There were no studies comparing the systems on the same patients. In aggregate, adopters of the AI systems reported average nonmydriatic gradability of 49% to 75% (n = 5), sensitivity 87% to 100% (n = 3), and specificity 60% to 91% (n = 4). Based on public records at the time of writing, both LumineticsCore and EyeArt have >5 academic adopters in the United States. Limited information is available on AEYE-DS given recency of regulatory clearance. Elements of successful implementation include proper site selection, aligning AI tools with primary care clinic workflows, streamlining patient engagement and referrals, and ongoing training of staff. Health systems utilizing AI reported improved Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures, health equity, productivity, and patient adherence to follow-up with ophthalmology.Artificial intelligence-aided diabetic eye examinations present a promising solution to facilitate early detection of DR, promote equitable access, and drive down system-level cost of care.

This meta-analysis compared high ligation (HL) versus low ligation (LL) of IMA in terms of postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).A systematic search of 5 databases (inception-May 2025) identified 15 RCTs comparing LL and HL in rectal or sigmoid cancer. Primary outcomes included 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall complications, and anastomotic leak (AL) rates. Secondary outcomes included lymph node yield, operative time, and blood loss. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were performed.A total of 2576 patients were included. LL significantly improved 5-year OS (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 0.026) and reduced AL rates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51-1.00; p = 0.050), without compromising DFS or lymph node yield. TSA confirmed the OS benefit and robustness of AL reduction, with the cumulative Z-curve crossing both the conventional and trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit. LL was not associated with increased overall complications, operative time, or blood loss. GRADE ratings indicated moderate-to-high certainty for key outcomes.Low ligation of the IMA offers a survival advantage and reduced anastomotic leak risk without compromising oncologic safety.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cytokine dysregulation and microglial dysfunction in adolescents with MDD (regardless of disease onset or duration) during the course of the disorder.This study included 60 adolescent patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls (HCs). Peripheral blood levels of nine target cytokines-including interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-were measured using ultrasensitive multiplex electrochemiluminescence assays. To better understand the potential changes in microglial cells of adolescents with MDD, the human microglial cell line HMC3 was treated with 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), a key neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway (KP), and the effects of 3-HK on microglial cells were subsequently evaluated.After multiple test correction using the Holm method, compared with the HCs, adolescents with MDD exhibited a significant increase in the level of the peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α. Moreover, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-18 showed an upward trend, while the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ showed a downward trend, yet none of these trends reached statistical significance. In addition, G-CSF levels were significantly decreased, while M-CSF levels were significantly increased. In vitro experiments, 3-HK significantly reduced the viability of human microglial cells. Further experiments demonstrated that 3-HK induced microglial pyroptosis in a concentration-dependent manner via the mitochondrial pathway, leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.Dysregulation of cytokines may lead to excessive activation of microglia, resulting in increased release of the neurotoxic KP metabolite 3-HK. This suppresses microglial proliferation and induces microglial cell death, including pyroptosis, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41134013,2026-01-02,Parameters Associated With Renal Recovery and Survival in Myeloma Patients With Acute Renal Failure to Cast Nephropathy.,"Acute renal failure due to cast nephropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we aimed to identify parameters associated with renal outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM patients with CAN-related acute renal failure and to validate the IMWG criteria for renal response. CAN diagnosis was based on biopsy or clinical assessment. Of 787 registered patients, 354 met the inclusion criteria, requiring at least two therapy cycles with documented chemotherapy response, renal response, and eGFR. Baseline free light chain (FLC) levels (median 6825.65 mg/L) decreased below 500 mg/L in 67.8% of patients. According to IMWG classification, renal complete response, partial response, and minimal response were achieved in 33.9%, 19.5%, and 28.0% of patients, respectively. The best eGFR values > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 33.9% of patients, while 33.3%, 22.3%, and 10.5% had best eGFR values of 30-59, 15-29, and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Renal response correlated with baseline FLC levels, IgG kappa, eGFR, and ECOG status in multivariate analysis, as well as with myeloma response and FLC reduction in univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 77.6 months. Survival correlated with age, myeloma response, ECOG status, FLC kappa type, baseline eGFR, standard-risk cytogenetics, and calcium levels, among other factors. A comparison of IMWG renal response criteria with classification based solely on best eGFR showed similar utility. Of 136 patients requiring dialysis, 80 (58.8%) were able to discontinue dialysis during therapy.

Interrater reliability for accuracy ratings was higher for LLM-generated responses (GPT-4 [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.30], Gemini [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.61], and MedLM [intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.58]), with lower agreement for expert responses (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.23). A similar pattern was observed for safety and source discrimination ratings. The agreement was strongest for safety assessments and weakest for source discrimination.Among the 3 tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrated closer agreement to expert decisions, thereby showing greater potential for supporting hypertension management.

This study explored whether large language models (LLMs) - advanced artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human-like text - could help improve the management of hypertension. The researchers created 51 hypothetical patient scenarios and had three different LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, and MedLM) as well as a human hypertension expert provide treatment recommendations. Blinded reviewers then evaluated the accuracy and safety of the recommendations. The results showed that the most advanced LLM, GPT-4, performed the best among the AI systems, with 83% accuracy and 86% safety in its recommendations. However, it still fell short of the expert, who achieved 92% accuracy and 93% safety. The other LLMs performed significantly worse.

We evaluated whether biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion-specifically, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch volume-were associated with recurrent ischemic stroke within 90 days.The BIORISK ICAS (Biomarkers and Recurrence Risk in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis) is a multicenter retrospective international study (35 sites) that included hospitalized patients with symptomatic ICAS (50%-99% luminal stenosis of the intracranial vertebral, basilar, distal internal carotid, or proximal middle cerebral artery) from January 2019 to June 2024. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery within 90 days. In the primary analysis, the exposure was an acute anterior circulation borderzone infarct. In secondary analysis of the subset with presentation within 72 hours of last known normal and perfusion imaging completed, the exposure of interest was prespecified as hypoperfusion mismatch volume at Tmax (time to maximum) threshold of 6 seconds, dichotomized at the Youden index. We performed multivariable Cox regression to test associations between exposure variables and the outcome, adjusting for clinically relevant variables and those associated with the outcome (P<0.1).Of 2050 patients with symptomatic ICAS, 1737 (84.7%) presented within 72 hours of symptom onset, among whom 509 (29.3%) underwent perfusion imaging. The primary analysis included 1891 patients; 174 (9.2%) patients had recurrent ischemic stroke in the symptomatic arterial territory. In adjusted Cox regression models, there was an association between anterior circulation borderzone infarct and recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.02-1.93]). In the perfusion imaging analysis, hypoperfusion mismatch of ≥10 mL was associated with recurrent ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.03-3.28]).Biomarkers of impaired distal perfusion, anterior circulation borderzone infarct, and hypoperfusion mismatch were associated with increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. These findings support the use of perfusion imaging in ICAS as well as future trials investigating early reperfusion in high-risk patients with ICAS.",Stroke,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Shadi Yaghi|Farhan Khan|Skylar Lewis|Ava Stipanovich|Richard Choi|Richard Baker|Sami Al Kasab|Ahmad Abu Qdais|Sridhara S Yaddanapudi|Sabiha Sultana|Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik|James Klaas|Ekaterina Bakradze|Muhammad Aemaz Ur Rehman|Christopher Leon Guerrero|Hadley W Ressler|Faddi G Saleh Velez|Cameron Owens|Camila B Pinto|Margy McCullough-Hicks|Dawson Cooper|Abhiram Parameswaran Pillai|Praveen Hariharan|Shaista Alam|Morgan Mayer|Mirjam R Heldner|Irina Kugler|Kateryna Antonenko|William Almiri|Sheila Martins|Thais L Secchi|Gabriel Mantovani|Aaron Rothstein|Kelly Sloane|Balaji Krishnaiah|Linda Alfred|Cheran Elangovan|Venugopalan Y Vishnu|Meena Chandu|Ayush Agarwal|Michele Romoli|Nicola Marrone|Stefano Vozzi|Malik Ghannam|Mohamed Elshikh|Mahmoud Dibas|Yan Hou|Krithika Peshwe|Ajay Tunguturi|João P Marto|Rui Duarte Armindo|Jennifer Frontera|Lindsey Kuohn|Mohammad AlMajali|Osama O Zaidat|Benan Barakat|Niha Khan|Alexis N Simpkins|Shayak Sen|Mariana Coelho|Joao Sargento Fritas|Joao A Sousa|Diana Aguiar de Sousa|Mafalda Soares|Amanda Cyntia Lima Fonseca Rodrigues|Aditya Jhaveri|Rami Z Morsi|James Siegler|Yasmin N Aziz|Pablo Harker|Sonia Bhati|Sophia Vassilopoulou|Argyro Tountopoulou|Adam de Havenon|Varsha Muddasani|Nils Henninger|Hieu Tran|Johanna Helenius|Mohammad Khasawneh|Ananth Vellimana|Ryan Apfel|Amir Molaie|Marina Mannino|Valeria Terruso|Tarek El Halabi|Mahasen Reda|Christel Tamer|Piers Klein|Liqi Shu|Pooja Khatri|Karen Furie|Thanh N Nguyen|David S Liebeskind|Shyam Prabhakaran,Muhib Khan|Maarij Malik,"Department of Neurology, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI (S.Y., F.K., S.L., A.S., L.S., K.F.).|Department of Neurology, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ (S.Y.).|Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA (S.A., M.

ICAS can increase the risk of having another stroke soon after an initial one. The researchers looked at whether certain brain imaging markers could help predict which ICAS patients are at highest risk of having another stroke within 90 days. 

They analyzed data from over 2,000 ICAS patients across 35 medical centers. The key findings were that two specific imaging markers were linked to a higher risk of recurrent stroke: 1) a type of brain injury called an ""anterior circulation borderzone infarct"", and 2) a mismatch between blood flow and oxygen demand in the brain, known as ""hypoperfusion mismatch"". Patients with these imaging markers were 40-80% more likely to have another stroke within 3 months.

These results suggest that advanced brain imaging could help identify ICAS patients who need urgent treatment to prevent another devastating stroke. This information could guide clinical decision-making and lead to new therapies targeted at restoring blood flow in high-risk ICAS patients",,

The researchers reviewed detailed case files on a large number of suicide deaths across the UK to better understand the relationship between self-harm and completed suicide in this vulnerable population. 

They found that a significant majority of the young people who died by suicide had a history of self-harm, often starting at a very young age. The researchers also identified common factors that contributed to suicide risk, such as mental health issues, trauma, and social/family difficulties. This suggests that early intervention and support for young people who self-harm could be crucial for preventing future suicide deaths. 

However, the study also highlighted gaps in data collection and the need for more comprehensive suicide prevention programs tailored to the unique needs of children and adolescents.

The researchers analyzed data from a large group of patients who had received MG testing as part of their anemia evaluation. They found that about 12% of these patients were diagnosed with a new MG condition through the testing. However, only a very small percentage (0.4%) of the MG test results actually provided clinically significant information that helped identify the underlying cause of the patient's anemia. This suggests that routine MG testing may not be necessary or helpful for most patients with anemia, unless there are other specific symptoms or risk factors present. 

These findings could help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about when MG testing is truly warranted, potentially reducing unnecessary medical procedures and costs. However, the study was limited to a single healthcare system, so more research is needed to confirm these results in other patient",,

Lutetium (Lu)-177 DOTATATE therapy has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with metastatic NET; however, there are limited data regarding the direct impact on cardiac metastases. Patients with intracardiac metastasis from NET were evaluated. Patients were stratified by treatment with Lu-177 DOTATATE. Quantitative assessments of the progression of cardiac metastatic size (maximal diameter) and metabolic activity, as measured by maximal standardized uptake value (SUV max ), were performed on serial 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET imaging. In a cohort of 23 patients, 11 patients (47.8%) received Lu-177 DOTATATE therapy. Through a median of 2.2 years of follow-up, these patients showed some reduction in metastatic burden with a median reduction in maximal diameter of 1.0 mm (IQR: 0.0-3.0) and a median change in SUV max of -1.6 (IQR: -4.4 to 1.5). In contrast, patients who did not receive Lu-177 DOTATATE had some increase in maximal diameter of 0.5 mm (-2.0 to 2.0) and an increase in SUV max of 1.4 (-6.2 to 2.3). Overall, Lu-177 DOTATATE therapy may result in modest regression of intracardiac metastases as assessed by molecular imaging, whereas patients with cardiac metastases who did not receive therapy appeared to show progression.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

We report a case of a 9-year-old male who presented with a progressively enlarging swelling of the left orbit associated with vision loss with atypical imaging features and an intracranial component with compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma. Histopathological examination subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of GCT. He was managed with a multimodal approach comprising neoadjuvant therapy and surgical excision, which achieved complete tumor removal, with no evidence of recurrence at 1-year follow-up.

It is also a type of functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), which are disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). The underlying mechanism is thought to involve a complex interaction between the gut and central nervous system (CNS), where altered gut signaling may lead to visceral hypersensitivity, while CNS dysregulation may cause hyper-vigilance, potentially contributing to motor disturbances. There is no standardized approach to the evaluation of FD and historically, it has been considered a diagnosis of exclusion. There is also no standardized treatment algorithm, and most FD treatments are garnered from other FGIDs. As our field gains a deeper appreciation of FGIDs, it is also clear that the management of suspected FD patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. This narrative review not only 1) provides an overview of FD including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, associated disorders, multidisciplinary assessment, and treatment, but also 2) details our unique multidisciplinary approach to FD patients from the perspective of gastroenterologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and GI psychologists at the Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders at the University of South Florida (USF CSD).",Gastro hep advances,2026,2026.0,,,Jaimie Anderson|Wojciech Blonski|Joy Gaziano|Camille Thélin|Rebecca Klam|Samuel Slone|Rene L Utianski|John Jacobs,Rene L Utianski,"Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, Speech Language Pathology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Division of Gastroenterology, James A Haley Veterans Affairs, Hospital, Tampa, Florida.|Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Swallowing Disorders, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Neurogastroenterology and Motility Center, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Jaimie Anderson, Wojciech Blonski, Joy Gaziano, Camille Thélin, Rebecca Klam, Samuel Slone, Rene L Utianski, John Jacobs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127144/,"Functional dysphagia is a condition where people have difficulty swallowing solid or liquid foods, but there is no clear physical cause like a blockage or muscle problem.

Metastatic breast cancer, where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, is a serious and often life-threatening condition. Accurately predicting how long patients with metastatic breast cancer may live is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and setting appropriate expectations. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer to test a novel ""prognostic staging system"" - a way of classifying patients into different risk groups based on factors like the extent of metastatic spread. They found that this new system was able to accurately predict overall survival as well as cancer-specific outcomes, meaning it could reliably identify patients with better or worse prognoses. This validation of the system's performance is an important step towards implementing it in clinical practice.

If further validated, this prognostic staging system could help doctors have more informed discussions with metastatic breast cancer patients about their likely disease course and treatment options. It may also enable more personalized and effective care by allowing doctors to tailor treatments based on a patient's predicted outcomes",,
41117176,2026-01-02,What Is Clinical Anatomy?-A Consensus Statement From the American Association of Clinical Anatomists.,"At the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA) in Bellevue, Washington, June 2025, two inaugural events-the Clinical Anatomy Fireside Chat (CAFC) and the Clinical Anatomy Symposium: Head and Neck 2025 (CAS)-fostered rich dialogue on the evolving role and operational definition of clinical anatomy. Experts from various clinical and anatomical disciplines explored the meaning of clinical anatomy, highlighting the absence of a universal definition despite its frequent use in education and research. Through these interdisciplinary discussions, a consensus emerged: clinical anatomy is not defined solely by the possession of clinical credentials but by the integration of anatomical knowledge and clinical relevance, achieved most effectively through collaboration. Clinical anatomy education and research require different depths of clinical knowledge depending on the audience and objective, and meaningful collaboration can bridge gaps in expertise. The symposium further illustrated that high-quality clinical anatomy emerges from mutual respect and reciprocal insight between clinicians and anatomists. This article presents a consensus statement developed by AACA representatives and invited speakers, affirming that collaboration is not only foundational to the practice of clinical anatomy but also fundamental to its definition. These conclusions aim to guide future educational models, research strategies, and interdisciplinary partnerships in the field of clinical anatomy.© 2025 The Author(s).

41177002,2026-01-02,Menstrual irregularities and cardiometabolic risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Menstrual cycle irregularities have been linked to several health hazards; it is unclear how these risks relate to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compile data regarding the relationship between irregular menstruation and women's cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes.A systematic search of online databases was conducted for studies comparing cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes between women with irregular and regular menstrual cycles. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated adopting a random effects model.Eight observational studies comprising 354,419 women were included. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a significantly increased risk of overall cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.01 to 2.03) compared to those with regular menstrual cycles. Subgroup analyses for specific cardiovascular outcomes demonstrated increased risks of coronary artery disease (RR: 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.14-1.46), hypertension (RR: 1.50, 95 % CI: 1.23-1.82) and heart failure (RR: 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.89) in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles. Additionally, the risk of cerebrovascular disease was higher in women with irregular cycles compared to those with regular cycles (RR: 1.62, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.40), Notably, patients with irregular menstrual cycles were found to have a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus (RR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.31-2.34) and hypercholesterolemia (RR: 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.52).Menstrual irregularities are associated with greater risks for several cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, highlighting the importance of regular check-ups to prevent disease occurrence in these patients.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers analyzed the medical records and genetic data of these 91 patients to see how the low mutation levels correlated with their clinical symptoms and disease progression over time. They found that even very low levels of the JAK2 V617F mutation can be associated with blood disorders like myeloproliferative neoplasms, which cause the overproduction of blood cells. However, the specific symptoms and disease course varied widely among patients, suggesting these low mutation levels don't always indicate a clear diagnosis. The study also revealed that the mutation levels can change over time, sometimes increasing or decreasing, which further complicates interpretation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve diagnostic performance, but robust benchmarks and reliable comparison to radiologists' performance are scarce. We established an open-source benchmark with the aim of investigating AI systems for PDAC detection on CT and compared them to radiologists' performance, at scale.In this international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory, observational study (PANORAMA), the AI system was trained and externally validated within an international benchmark, with a cohort of 2310 patients from four tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the USA for training (n=2224) and tuning (n=86), and a sequestered cohort of 1130 patients from five tertiary care centres (the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway) for testing. A multi-reader, multi-case observer study with 68 radiologists (40 centres, 12 countries; median 9·0 [IQR 6·0-14·5] years of experience) was conducted on a subset of 391 patients from the testing cohort. The reference standard was established with histopathology and at least 3 years of clinical follow-up. The primary endpoint was the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system compared to that of radiologists at PDAC detection on CT. The study protocol and statistical plan were prespecified to test non-inferiority (considering a margin of 0·05), followed by superiority towards the AI system. This study is registered with Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10599559) and is complete.Of the 3440 (1511 [44%] female, 1929 [56%] male; median age 67 [IQR 58-74] years) included patients (Jan 1, 2004 to Dec 31, 2023), 1103 (32%) received a positive PDAC diagnosis. In the sequestered testing cohort of 1130 patients (406 with histologically confirmed PDAC), AI achieved an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·90-0·93). In the subset of 391 patients (144 [37%] with histologically confirmed PDAC) used for the reader study, AI achieved statistically non-inferior (p<0·0001) and superior (p=0·001) performance with an AUROC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·89-0·94), compared to the pool of 68 participating radiologists, with an AUROC of 0·88 (0·85-0·91).AI demonstrated substantially improved PDAC detection on routine CT scans compared to radiologists on average, showing potential to detect cancer earlier and improve patient outcomes.European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

41236415,2026-01-02,Advances in echocardiography for cardiac amyloidosis and restrictive cardiomyopathies.,"Cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with characteristic echocardiographic findings. Echocardiography is the initial imaging test to identify restrictive cardiomyopathies, and timely diagnosis is important for treatment and prognosis. This review outlines key echocardiographic ""red flags,"" structural and functional findings, and emerging diagnostic tools that enhance early recognition and monitoring of cardiac amyloidosis.Classic echocardiographic red flags for cardiac amyloidosis include increased ventricular wall thickness, biatrial enlargement, pericardial effusion, and a granular myocardial appearance. Tissue Doppler imaging shows reduced mitral annular velocities, while advanced disease presents with restrictive filling patterns. Global longitudinal strain with apical sparing is a hallmark finding that distinguishes cardiac amyloidosis from other cardiomyopathies. Left atrial strain has been proposed as a prognostic marker for thromboembolism in cardiac amyloidosis. Evidence shows variability in strain measurements across different vendors, which is an important consideration when comparing results between institutions in both research and clinical practice. Echocardiography can be used in conjunction with multimodal imaging techniques in order to monitor disease progression.Echocardiography is the initial diagnostic test of choice and several findings can suggest cardiac amyloidosis.

Care coordination (CC) may strengthen SBIRT by supporting brief interventions, improving referral follow-through, and enhancing continuity. CC models and outcomes vary, however, and no prior scoping review has synthesized these.A comprehensive search of 10 resources, including Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, was conducted on 4/15/2025. Eligible studies described outpatient SBIRT models adding CC for any age group. Articles were excluded if they lacked CC, presented no original data, or were not in English. Relevant implementation and patient-level outcomes were extracted to describe CC models and their impact.Of 737 abstracts and 50 full texts reviewed, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Studies spanned primary care, specialty care, and age ranges. CC models included embedded behavioral health providers, centralized linkage managers, and remote coordinators using phone or digital platforms. CC was associated with higher screening completion, brief intervention delivery, referral initiation, and treatment engagement. Successful integration incorporated structured communication, follow-up protocols, and accessible technology. Barriers included limited billing infrastructure, weak electronic record integration, and unclear roles.CC appears to enhance SBIRT implementation and treatment engagement across outpatient settings. Embedded approaches offer relational benefits, while remote and digital strategies show promise for scalability.

A distinct intermuscular fascial border aids in delineating the separation between the brachioradialis (BR) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) muscles. However, this border may be absent, making correct needle placement complex and assessment more difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe the presence and absence of this fascial border in healthy individuals to help with accurate EMG needle placement.Twenty healthy patients underwent sonographic examination by a single sonographer physician of the ECRL and BR to identify the presence or absence of the intermuscular fascial border.The fascial border that routinely separates the ECRL and BR was absent in at least one arm in 20% of subjects (12.5% of upper limbs). One subject had an absent fascial border in both upper limbs.US can assess for the presence or absence of intermuscular fascial borders.

When a patient receives an artificial hip or knee, the body can sometimes react by breaking down the surrounding bone, a condition known as periprosthetic osteolysis. This can lead to the implant becoming loose and failing, requiring additional surgery. 

The researchers investigated how FSTL1 influences this bone-destroying process. They found that FSTL1 promotes the development of osteoclasts, specialized cells that break down bone. FSTL1 activates a cellular signaling pathway called JNK, which drives osteoclast formation and accelerates periprosthetic osteolysis around the implant. 

These findings suggest that targeting FSTL1 or the JNK pathway could be a promising approach to prevent or slow down this complication in joint replacement patients. This could help improve the long-term success of these common surgeries and reduce the need for revision operations. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and develop effective therapies based on this discovery.",,
41263784,2026-01-02,Relationship between aerobic fitness and adipose tissue insulin resistance.,"Aerobic fitness is associated with greater skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity with regard to glucose uptake. Whether fitness is associated with an improvement in the insulin regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis is unknown. We collated adipose insulin sensitivity, body composition, and fitness data from six of our previously published and two of our unpublished protocols. Adipose tissue insulin resistance index of palmitate (ADIPO-IRpalmitate) data were available for 340 volunteers, and the insulin concentration resulting in a 50% suppression of palmitate rate of appearance (FFApalmitate IC50) measured using the insulin clamp technique was available for 108 volunteers. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the independent variables of aerobic fitness [peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak), mL kg·FFM-1·min-1], age, sex, body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), body fat, percent body fat, and the dependent variables ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Factors that were univariately correlated (P < 0.001) with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 were BMI, percent body fat, body fat, and VAT. Fitness correlated negatively with ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50. Stepwise regression analysis showed that fitness independently predicted ADIPO-IRpalmitate and FFApalmitate IC50 after adjusting for the other significant factors. These findings suggest that aerobic fitness may promote metabolic health through positive effects on adipose tissue. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00254371; the other protocols were not considered clinical trials at the time they were conducted.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Greater degrees of aerobic fitness are associated with greater insulin-mediated muscle glucose uptake. Insulin regulates adipose tissue lipolysis, whether aerobic fitness affects insulin's ability to regulate lipolysis is unknown. We found that greater fitness is associated with improved adipose tissue insulin responsiveness independent of age, sex, BMI, visceral adipose tissue, body fat (kg), percent body fat, and adipocyte size.

Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and fat metabolism. When someone is less responsive to insulin, it can lead to conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity. 

The researchers looked at data from over 300 volunteers, measuring their aerobic fitness (how efficiently their body uses oxygen during exercise), body composition, and how sensitive their fat tissue was to insulin. They found that people with higher aerobic fitness tended to have fat tissue that was more responsive to insulin, even after accounting for factors like age, sex, and body mass index. This suggests that improving aerobic fitness through exercise may have benefits beyond just muscle function - it could also help the body better regulate fat metabolism and storage. 

These findings are important because they indicate that exercise and improved fitness may have wide-ranging metabolic benefits, not just for muscles but also for fat tissue. This could have implications for managing conditions like diabetes and obesity.

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of severe pain during the 1-week period after RCT among consecutive patients requiring RCT and to identify pre-operative and intra-operative predictors of post-RCT severe pain in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network.This prospective cohort study enrolled patients across 153 general and endodontic practices. Eligible adults undergoing RCT completed surveys before and 1 week after treatment. Severe post-RCT pain was defined as patient-reported worst pain ≥7 on a 0-10 scale in the prior 7 days. Demographic, clinical, procedural, and psychosocial characteristics were collected and analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, accounting for clustering by practice.Among 1,059 patients, mean worst pain scores declined significantly from 5.3 pre-RCT to 2.6 post-RCT (p<.001). However, 14% reported severe pain at 1 week. Female sex, severe pain at time of RCT, screening positive for temporomandibular disorders, diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and having taken pain medication for tooth pain in the 7 days prior to RCT, were each significantly associated with severe post-RCT pain. Neither age, tooth type, provider specialty status, or psychosocial characteristics were independently predictive. Presence of a draining sinus tract and use of over 5x magnification were protective.One in seven patients reported severe pain in the first week after RCT, primarily associated with pre-operative pain factors and patient sex, underscoring the value of targeted pain management for high-risk patients.Despite overall pain reduction after RCT, 14% of patients experience severe pain at one week.

These diseases are associated with bowel disturbances, which should be evaluated preferably with questionnaires, and with anal weakness and/or DD, often evident on a thorough digital rectal examination. Fissures and DD are closely linked to constipation, whereas FI is typically associated with diarrhea. For most patients with mild symptoms, lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and/or pharmacotherapy suffice. Some patients require tests to rule out serious diseases; assess anorectal functions, which are discussed in detail; and to identify structural abnormalities, such as rectoceles, which are occasionally clinically significant. Treatments are applied stepwise, starting with conservative therapy with simpler treatments when feasible (eg, rubber band ligation for grade I-II hemorrhoids), with surgery, usually excisional hemorrhoidectomy, being reserved for more severe disease; for anal fissures, topical therapy using a calcium channel antagonist or nitroglycerine, followed by botulinum toxin and, less frequently, lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic fissures. Anorectal biofeedback therapy is effective for managing DD and, together with bowel modifiers tailored to the specific symptoms (ie, constipation and/or diarrhea), is also used for FI. Biofeedback therapy is not widely accessible, and many patients are treated by pelvic floor physical therapists. For FI, minimally invasive options include sacral neuromodulation and anal dextranomer injection, with colostomy or anal sphincteroplasty now rarely required.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have drawn attention for their impact on obesity. With a dense population of receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract, it is critical to understand the way that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists impact gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.To evaluate the expanding role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity and gastrointestinal disease, with a focus on therapeutic applications, impact on gastrointestinal cancers, safety profile, and implications for gastroenterology practice.We conducted a narrative review of recent clinical trials, cohort studies, and guideline updates through 2025. Evidence was synthesised on efficacy, safety, and clinical implications across gastrointestinal disorders including steatotic liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, and obesity-associated cancers.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists induce substantial and durable weight loss and improve obesity-related gastrointestinal outcomes. They are approved for steatotic liver disease, with demonstrated histologic and biochemical benefits. Evidence suggests a reduced incidence of several gastrointestinal cancers. The most common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and delayed gastric emptying, which may affect peri-endoscopic management. Discontinuation rates remain substantial but can be mitigated by careful titration and specialist oversight.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a critical therapy for obesity and several related gastrointestinal conditions.

Recent structural biology advances have significantly improved our understanding of GPCRs activation mechanisms and their interactions with G-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways, where they regulate neurotransmission at synapses and maintain neuronal homeostasis by activating heterotrimeric G-protein (Gαβγ). Evidence from preclinical studies suggests that GPCRs enhance neuronal excitability, especially in epilepsy, a condition impacting about 1-2% of the global population. Currently approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) mainly target ion channels but fail to address key pathological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, synaptic remodelling, and imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission. These unresolved mechanisms, combined with the side effects of AEDs, present a significant therapeutic gap in seizure treatment and drug-resistant seizures. This gap in therapy highlights the need for ongoing research into novel molecular targets for more effective epilepsy treatments. The keywords GPR39, GPR40, epilepsy, seizure, convulsive, and GPCRs were used to search PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This review explores recent insights into the roles of specific GPCR families in initiating, spreading, or attenuating seizures. It also discusses challenges in developing GPCR-targeted therapies and suggests strategies to overcome these obstacles. A particular focus is placed on GPR39 and GPR40, highlighting their roles in seizure modulation and their potential to prevent epileptogenesis and neuroinflammation. However, more research is necessary to clarify uncertainties regarding how ligand interactions with GPCRs affect physiological and therapeutic outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects around 1-2% of the global population, and current medications often have significant side effects or fail to control seizures effectively. The researchers reviewed existing scientific evidence to understand how these receptors, which are part of a larger family of receptors called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), may play a role in the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy. 

The review suggests that activating or modulating GPR39 and GPR40 could help regulate neuronal excitability, reduce neuroinflammation, and restore the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain - key factors that contribute to seizures. While more research is still needed to fully understand how these receptors function and how they could be targeted therapeutically, the findings indicate that GPR39 and GPR40 represent promising new avenues for developing safer, more effective epilepsy treatments.

We aimed to evaluate the association between serum Hcy levels and the risk of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis in a large, diverse population, accounting for clinical confounders and effect modifiers such as sex and reproductive status.We analyzed 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 8253 adults (≥18 years) without hepatitis B/C, excessive alcohol use, or pregnancy. MASLD was defined using the fatty liver index (≥30), and fibrosis risk was assessed using age-adjusted Fibrosis-4 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score among MASLD subjects (N = 5328). Associations between serum Hcy and MASLD/fibrosis risk were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for confounders, with stratification by sex and menopausal status.Serum Hcy levels were higher among those with MASLD (fatty liver index ≥30), though the association was attenuated after covariate adjustment. Among MASLD individuals, those at higher fibrosis risk (based on Fibrosis-4 or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score) had significantly elevated Hcy levels. This association remained significant in men and postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women.Elevated serum Hcy is independently associated with hepatic fibrosis risk in MASLD, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.

MASLD is a common condition where excess fat buildup in the liver can lead to inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), which can progress to more serious liver damage. 

The researchers analyzed data from a large, diverse group of adults in the United States, looking at their blood homocysteine levels and signs of liver fibrosis. They found that people with MASLD who had higher homocysteine levels were more likely to have a higher risk of advanced liver fibrosis. This association was particularly strong in men and women after menopause, but not in women before menopause. 

These findings suggest that elevated homocysteine may be an important factor contributing to the development of liver fibrosis in MASLD. Understanding this relationship could help identify individuals at higher risk and guide potential treatments targeting homocysteine to prevent or slow the progression of liver disease. However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and determine if lowering homocysteine levels can actually improve liver health,",,

Similarly, AI has been applied to surgical education research, creating a need to assess the relevance and applicability of existing guidelines in this context. This narrative review synthesized guidelines and checklists related to AI in surgical education, providing researchers with an introductory roadmap for conducting rigorous, reproducible studies and identifying gaps for future framework development.In April 2024, the authors conducted a search using Ovid (Embase and MEDLINE(R)) from 1946 to 2024 to identify guidelines and checklists related to AI research in healthcare and surgical education. Search teams included ""artifical intelligence"" and related terms, as well as ""checklist"", ""recommendations"", and terms related to evaluation, reporting, and guidelines. Titles and abstracts were screened and the authors reviewed eligible full-text articles for inclusion through consensus discussions.From 200 studies identified, 47 full-text articles were reviewed, and 16 guidelines and checklists were included. These were grouped into six thematic categories: AI research with health education applications, Generative AI and Large Language Model studies, machine learning/prediction models, AI in imaging, and forthcoming guidelines. Key findings highlighted the diversity in purpose, methodology, and scope. Although gaps were identified in existing guidelines and checklists for surgical education, with only one tailored to AI research in healthcare education, the authors demonstrated how these other resources could be applied.This review highlighted that while existing guidelines and checklists could be applied in certain contexts, significant gaps remained in education-specific research guidance. Future efforts should focus on developing tailored guidelines to address the unique challenges and opportunities of AI integration in surgical education, ensuring rigorous and reproducible research.Copyright © 2025 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

41193370,2026-01-02,Comparative Survival in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer by Volume of Disease and Timing of Metastasis: A Living Network Meta-analysis.,"We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of contemporary systemic treatment options across patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) across clinically relevant prognostic subgroups (synchronous high [SHV] and low [SLV] volume, and metachronous high [MHV] and low [MLV] volume).This living network meta-analysis was conducted using the living interactive evidence (LIvE) synthesis framework. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing treatment intensification with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), docetaxel (D), or both were included. Mixed treatment comparisons were conducted for overall population and for each prognostic subgroup (SHV, SLV, MHV, and MLV). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were assessed.The current report of a living systematic review includes a total of 11 trials (12 668 patients and 12 unique treatments). In the overall population, the results were consistent with those of a previous report. An analysis of OS by prespecified subgroups included nine clinical trials (8990 patients and eight unique treatments). In the SHV subgroup (N = 5171; 57%), ARPI + D + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with D + ADT (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.83) and ARPI + ADT (0.71; 0.53-0.97). In the SLV subgroup (N = 2455; 27%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.65; 0.52-0.80). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.08; 0.65-1.79). In the MHV subgroup (N = 589; 6.5%), no statistically significant improvement was observed with ARPI + D + ADT compared with ARPI + ADT (0.89; 0.43-1.85) and D + ADT (0.90; 0.60-1.36). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + ADT and D + ADT (1.02; 0.45-2.28). In the MLV subgroup (N = 775; 8.5%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with ADT alone (0.43; 0.29-0.64) and D + ADT (0.41; 0.24-0.70). There was no statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.56; 0.40-6.25). Inherent limitations of this analysis include the inability to account for all relevant variables such as the patient- and cancer-related factors that likely influenced the decision of physicians to offer docetaxel to patients.Current evidence suggests that triplet systemic therapy is preferred for patients with SHV mHSPC who are fit for docetaxel. Androgen receptor pathway doublet therapy is preferred for all other patient subgroups compared with ADT alone. There is no role of docetaxel doublet in patients with access to ARPI therapy and if they are able to receive it.Copyright © 2025.

41189469,2026-01-02,Senotherapeutics for metabolic disease and diabetic complications.,"Metabolic diseases, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome, are increasingly prevalent worldwide, driven by sedentary lifestyles, aging populations, and complex genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally understood as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, a growing body of evidence now implicates cellular senescence as a central, age-related contributor to metabolic dysfunction. Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in key metabolic tissues where they disrupt tissue function through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic secretome. SASP factors exacerbate insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and tissue remodeling, advancing the progression and complications of metabolic diseases. These insights have catalyzed the development of senotherapeutics, a class of interventions that includes senolytics (to eliminate SCs), senomorphics (to suppress SASP), and senosensitizers (to render resistant SCs more vulnerable to clearance). Although preclinical studies show promise, translation into clinical practice faces significant challenges, including identifying reliable biomarkers, understanding SC heterogeneity, and optimizing treatment timing and safety. As research advances, senotherapeutics may offer a transformative approach not only to managing metabolic diseases but also to mitigating associated comorbidities. The recognition that antidiabetic agents already in clinical use can modulate key features of senescence highlights a unique translational opportunity, suggesting that prevention of age-related metabolic disorders may be achievable with therapies already available in routine clinical practice. Medicine is poised to enter a new era in which targeting cellular senescence could fundamentally reshape the prevention and treatment of age-related metabolic disorders, offering the potential for improved healthspan and reduced disease burden across the lifespan.© 2025 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.",Journal of internal medicine,"Jan, 2026",2026.0,Jan,,Allyson K Palmer|Rosa Spinelli|Larissa GL Prata|Selim Chaib|Masayoshi Suda|Tamar Tchkonia|Ulf Smith|James L Kirkland,Allyson K Palmer,"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.|Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.|Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.","Allyson K Palmer, Rosa Spinelli, Larissa GL Prata, Selim Chaib, Masayoshi Suda, Tamar Tchkonia, Ulf Smith, James L Kirkland",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41189469/,"Metabolic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are becoming more common worldwide due to factors like sedentary lifestyles and aging populations.

41187859,2026-01-02,Frequent EPHA2 receptor mutations in cholangiocarcinoma disrupt receptor forward signaling supporting a tumor suppressor role.,"Although EPHA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase widely expressed in many cancers, it exhibits a uniquely high frequency of coding sequence mutations in cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the biliary tract with dismal prognosis. EPHA2 is extensively studied, but very little is known about the role of EPHA2 cancer mutations. To define the functional significance of EPHA2 mutations in biliary tract cancers, we generated representative EPHA2 mutants and monitored major receptor autophosphorylation sites as indicators of kinase activity-dependent signal transduction (known as forward signaling). We found that missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain abrogate ephrinA ligand binding, while missense mutations in the kinase domain abrogate kinase activity. The effects of missense mutations in other domains were less pronounced and varied depending on the phosphosite. The majority of the EPHA2 mutations are nonsense or frame-shift mutations that introduce early stop codons. They generate EPHA2 truncated forms that lack an intact kinase domain or, in some cases, most of the coding sequence. Several EPHA2 mutants tested inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of co-expressed EPHA2 wild-type, indicating the ability to exert dominant negative effects. We show that EPHA2 forward signaling in cholangiocytes inhibits the ERK oncogenic pathway and cell proliferation, suggesting that loss-of-function mutations facilitate tumor development in the biliary tract. Indeed, an EPHA2 kinase-inactive mutant, but not EPHA2 wild-type, induced proliferative masses consistent with well differentiated cholangiocarcinoma in a validated mouse model of cholangiocarcinogenesis. Thus, EPHA2 has the attributes of a driver gene with tumor suppressor activity in biliary tract cancers.Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The median age at cyst detection and removal were 4.8 months (IQR 3.6-9.6) and 1.8 years (IQR 0.9-5.3), respectively. In 42 patients, parents have noticed the presence of the cyst immediately after birth. Cyst wall rupture during surgical removal was reported in 15.4%. The median follow-up time was 1.3 months (IQR 0.5-12.2). Three patients experienced recurrence. No postoperative complication was reported. The regions with the highest prevalence of ICE were the forehead, frontotemporal scalp, and nasal region. The lateral frontal/temporal scalp had a 33.3% rate of ICE. Midline forehead/scalp lesions demonstrated a higher risk of ICE compared to their lateral equivalents (54.5% vs 17.5%, P = .03).

41364602,2026-01-02,Weekly Comprehensive Assessments for Optimizing Care of Patients With a Discharge Delay.,"The purpose of this project was to explore patient safety, quality outcomes, and staff satisfaction related to decreasing comprehensive patient assessments to once weekly for patients with a discharge delay.The project involved piloting once-weekly comprehensive assessments for medically stable patients on a general medical-surgical unit and a long-stay unit. The pilots aimed to reduce the frequency of comprehensive assessments while maintaining patient safety, reducing patient interruptions, and improving staff satisfaction.The pilot for the general medical-surgical unit had low compliance and was discontinued. However, the pilot in the long-stay unit was successful, saving nurses an estimated 3534 minutes per week. Several measured quality indicators improved, although there were small increases in hospital-acquired pressure injuries and Clostridioides difficile infections.

The researchers piloted a program where medically stable patients received comprehensive assessments just once per week, rather than the usual daily or every-other-day schedule. The study was conducted on a general medical-surgical unit and a long-stay unit. While the medical-surgical pilot was discontinued due to low compliance, the long-stay unit pilot was successful. It saved nurses an estimated 3,500 minutes per week, and several quality measures improved, though there were small increases in some hospital-acquired infections. Importantly, 87.5% of nurses supported continuing the weekly assessment schedule. This suggests that reducing assessment frequency can benefit both patients and staff, without compromising safety, for individuals who are medically stable but experiencing delays in being discharged from the hospital. The findings indicate this approach could be implemented in other healthcare settings, as long as appropriate patient monitoring is maintained. This research highlights an opportunity to improve efficiency and staff satisfaction in hospital care, which could have meaningful impacts for patients and the healthcare system.",,
41289513,2026-01-02,Sustainability of Complex Interventions: Recommendations From a Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Manage Cancer Symptoms.,"Sustained implementation of evidence-based practices and interventions in clinical settings is essential to ensure patients receive the best evidence-informed care. Information to guide sustainment of complex, multicomponent interventions in routine clinical practice after grant funding ends has had limited attention in the literature.The purpose of this article is to describe the efforts of our multidisciplinary trial team to foster sustainment of key components of a complex electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated symptom surveillance and management intervention for people receiving cancer care at a Midwestern quaternary medical center or community practice settings.The parent Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial assessed the effectiveness of a multicomponent EHR-facilitated, collaborative care model-based intervention for management of SPPADE symptoms (sleep interference, pain, impaired physical function, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit/fatigue) and its implementation in medical oncology and community practice settings. The dynamic sustainability framework (DSF) posits the need for on-going efforts to continuously optimize the fit of an intervention within dynamic and evolving delivery contexts. This brief report uses the DSF to describe our team's efforts to optimize the fit of the core E2C2 intervention components to the practice setting and broader ecological system during the conduct of the trial. These activities were designed to achieve sustained implementation of the intervention in routine care delivery as the funded research activities concluded.Core intervention components to be sustained were symptom surveillance using electronic patient-reported outcome measures, clinician alerts for severe symptoms, access to a registered nurse symptom care manager (RN SCM) for severe symptoms, patient education materials to support symptom self-management, access to a website of cancer-related materials, and the training and supervision of the RN SCMs.Sustainability is dynamic and multidimensional, and emphasizes the importance of optimizing the fit of key intervention components to the care delivery context as it evolves time. Investigators are advised to plan sustainability efforts early, embrace change inherent in dynamic settings, and carefully track adaptations of intervention components to maximize intervention fit in real-world clinical practice to ensure patients continue to derive benefit from evidence-informed care.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

The researchers studied a complex intervention that used electronic health records and a nurse care manager to help cancer patients better manage symptoms like pain, fatigue, and anxiety. The study was a ""pragmatic clinical trial"" - a real-world test of the intervention in medical oncology clinics and community practices. The researchers used a framework called the ""dynamic sustainability framework"" to guide their efforts to adapt the intervention to fit the needs of each clinic over time. This helped ensure the key components, like symptom tracking and nurse support, could be sustained in routine clinical care. The findings show that proactively planning for sustainability, embracing changes in the healthcare setting, and tailoring the intervention are crucial for maintaining the benefits of evidence-based practices long-term. This is important because it helps cancer patients continue receiving the best possible care, even as healthcare systems and funding sources evolve. A limitation is that the study was conducted at a single healthcare system, so more research is needed to see if the approach works in other settings.",,
38349134,2026-01-02,The Association and Utility of Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure in Predicting the Development of and in Managing Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a significant complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography, and its development is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) provides one index of left heart filling status. An elevated LVEDP can reflect volume overload or abnormal diastolic function and indicates a cardiac disorder. Data on the association between an elevated LVEDP and CIN are limited and have had conflicting results. We systematically searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for full-text articles from database inception to May 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated the association between a high LVEDP and the incidence of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The study was registered in the PROSPERO CRD42022334070. A second search in PubMed identified randomized controlled trials using LVEDP to guide fluid administration during coronary procedures. Four studies were identified that used LVEDP to classify patients into groups to determine the association between the level and the development of CIN. In these studies, 240 patients of 2441 patients (9.8%) developed CIN. One study found no association between LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. Two studies found an increased frequency of CIN in patients with elevated levels using 2 cutoff points for LVEDP, ≥20 mm Hg and >30 mm Hg. One study found that lower LVEDP levels (5-14 mm Hg) were associated with the development of CIN. Three randomized control trials used LVDEP levels to manage fluid administration in patients undergoing coronary procedures; only one study found that the use of these levels to guide fluid administration resulted in better outcomes. In patients undergoing coronary angiography, an elevated LVEDP was not consistently associated with increased risk of CIN, and using LVEDP levels to guide fluid administration during these procedures did not always improve outcomes in comparison to other protocols. The use of LVEDP levels can help classify patients with cardiac disorders but does not necessarily provide an adequate description of the hemodynamic patterns in these patients to predict or prevent CIN in patients undergoing angiography.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This research looked at whether measuring a specific heart function marker, called left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), could help predict and manage the risk of CIN in these patients.

The researchers reviewed several studies that examined the link between high LVEDP levels and the development of CIN. They found mixed results - some studies showed a higher risk of CIN in patients with elevated LVEDP, while others found no association or even a link between lower LVEDP and CIN. The researchers also looked at studies that used LVEDP to guide fluid management during coronary procedures, but again the results were inconsistent, with only one study showing improved outcomes.

Overall, this research suggests that while LVEDP can provide information about a patient's heart function, it does not reliably predict or prevent the occurrence of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

38230923,2026-01-02,Endocardial Fibroelastosis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Endocardial fibroelastosis emerged as a challenging clinical phenomenon in the 1940s. It is characterized by an atypical proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue within the heart and is primarily observed in childhood, occasionally displaying familial inheritance. While the precise cause remains elusive, various factors, including genetic, infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, oncologic, and medication-related influences, appear to play a role in its pathogenesis. The coexistence of endocardial fibroelastosis with multiple cardiac structural abnormalities manifests in symptoms of congestive heart failure and rhythm abnormalities. Despite its challenging diagnosis, various findings from ECG and imaging have proven beneficial in further evaluation of this condition. Finally, the treatment approach to endocardial fibroelastosis became complex due to addressing its concurrent cardiac abnormalities. Strategies for managing and preventing this condition are still under investigation. In this review, we intend to highlight the existing knowledge and illuminate future considerations regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To investigate this, we interrogated 44 whole genome and exome sequencing data from 34 patients with t(11;14) MM treated with venetoclax. The presence of mutations in the RAS pathway was strongly associated with shortened progression-free survival (PFS) and was validated in an independent cohort of 21 MM patients. Presence of 1q gain was also associated with shorter PFS in patients without RAS mutations. In 10 patients with paired, pre- and post-venetoclax treatment samples, post-venetoclax progression was recurrently driven by the selection of genomic events in BCL2/MCL1 and RAS pathways and of high-risk features (e.g., loss of TP53 and CDKN2C).

41481368,2026-01-03,The Renal miRNA Expression Profile of Pkd1RC/RC Mice Changes Longitudinally with the Progression of the Disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of bilateral kidney cysts, which often leads to kidney failure. This study comprehensively characterized the expression profile of miRNAs and their target genes in Pkd1RC/RC mice and further compared them with other murine models of PKD and a model of CKD, and individuals with ADPKD.Pkd1RC/RC and WT mice (n=10 each, 5 males and 5 females) were studied at 1, 6, and 12 months. At each time point, kidney volume was determined in vivo (MRI), followed by ex vivo histomorphometric analyses. In randomly selected Pkd1RC/RC and WT mouse kidneys (n=5/genotype, at 1 and 12 months), miRNA-sequencing (seq) was performed, followed by mRNA-seq, integrated (miRNA-seq/mRNA-seq analysis), and functional analysis of miRNA target genes. Venn diagrams were constructed to identify overlapping and novel differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in Pkd1RC/RC and other commonly used murine models of PKD, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and individuals with ADPKD.miRNA-seq analysis identified 41 and 181 miRNAs DE in Pkd1RC/RC versus WT kidneys at 1 and 12 months, respectively, which were confirmed by qPCR. Target genes of miRNAs DE in Pkd1RC/RC at early stages encoded for proteins mainly implicated in cell proliferation and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) transport, whereas those DE at late stages encoded for transport proteins involved in pro-inflammatory and metabolic processes. Urine α-KG concentration (1H NMR spectroscopy), its fractional excretion, and tissue levels were higher in Pkd1RC/RC during the entire course of the disease and associated with decreased protein expression of α-KG transporters NaDC3 and Oat1. We further identified common DE miRNAs among murine models of PKD, DKD and previous reports in individuals with ADPKD, as well as several novel miRNAs DE in early and late Pkd1RC/RC kidneys, which have not been previously reported in either other murine models of PKD or patients with ADPKD.Our study demonstrates that the renal miRNA expression profile changes longitudinally with the progression of the disease, and might suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of α-KG transport could represent a novel early feature of the disease.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

41290367,2026-01-03,Outcomes of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE in Patients with Metastatic Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has emerged as a promising treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (mPPGL). This study aimed to evaluate PRRT outcomes in patients with mPPGL in a single institution. Methods: Records of patients with mPPGL who received PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes of interest were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), symptomatic benefit, hypertension control, and treatment-related toxicity. ORR included complete response and partial response, whereas DCR encompassed complete response, partial response, and stable disease, determined using RECIST 1.1. Symptomatic benefit was defined as patient-reported symptom improvement relative to baseline. Hypertension control was assessed on the basis of adjustments in antihypertensive medication requirements. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Overall survival and progression-free survival were also evaluated. Results: Of the 15 patients included in our study, 7 (47%) had paraganglioma and 8 (53%) had pheochromocytoma. The mean follow-up duration was 28.4 ± 19.3 mo. PRRT was the initial systemic therapy in 2 patients (13%), and 2 treated with PRRT (13%) underwent retreatment, receiving 8 cycles. Two patients (13%) discontinued PRRT because of disease progression, and the remaining 13 patients (87%) completed all 4 cycles. The ORR was 27%, and the DCR was 73%, including 7 patients with stable disease and 4 with a partial response. The mean PRRT response duration was 16.2 ± 14.2 mo. A reduction in dose or no escalation of antihypertensive therapy was observed in 13 patients (87%). Ten patients (67%) reported symptom improvement. The most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 anemia and leukopenia (40%). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities occurred in 2 patients (13%), including 1 with thrombocytopenia (7%) and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome (7%). No moderate or severe nephrotoxicity was observed. Hypertensive crises occurred in 2 patients (13%), 1 with a prior history of such events. The median overall survival was 54.8 mo (95% CI, 6.8-102.8 mo), and the median progression-free survival was 26.9 mo (95% CI, 13.3-40.5 mo). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PRRT remains a therapeutic strategy for mPPGL, is well-tolerated, and may improve cancer-related symptoms.

These cancers develop in the body's hormone-producing glands and can spread to other organs. The researchers looked at the outcomes of using a specialized radiation therapy called peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 15 patients with these metastatic cancers. 

The PRRT treatment involves injecting radioactive molecules that target and destroy cancer cells. The researchers found that PRRT was generally well-tolerated, with most patients experiencing only mild side effects like anemia and low white blood cell counts. Over two-thirds of patients showed disease stabilization or partial shrinkage of their tumors, and many reported improvements in their cancer-related symptoms. The treatment also helped control high blood pressure, a common complication of these cancers. While the overall survival time was variable, the results suggest PRRT could be a valuable option for managing metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma when other treatments fail.

41206919,2026-01-03,A proposed path to explaining the unexplained anemia of aging.,"Approximately 17% of people aged 65 years and older are anemic, and 10% of death certificates report anemia as a secondary cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, anemia remains unexplained in 30%-50% of older adults. This unexplained anemia of aging (UAA) is a diagnosis of exclusion. The mechanism, impact, and progression of UAA remain unknown. At older ages, anemia adds to pre-existing co-morbidities with significant adverse health consequences, representing a compelling unmet clinical concern. The National Institute on Aging held a workshop in 2024 to discuss current knowledge and research opportunities. Topics included the epidemiology of anemia at older age and its clinical implications; probable mechanism(s) underlying UAA, that is, low-grade inflammation's effects on erythropoiesis; the role of microbiota in iron regulation in bone marrow; the importance of ruling out a diagnosis of leukemic clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which is more prevalent in older age; the role of senescence and aging governing hematopoiesis; and the effects of sex hormones on hematopoietic stem cell aging. Understanding the roles of these factors could reduce the proportion of the older anemic population whose anemia remains unexplained and offer insights into new potential diagnostic and intervention strategies. Speakers reviewed previous clinical trials in patients with UAA and CH. They discussed lessons learned and future research priorities, including efforts to develop new diagnostic algorithms and potential uses of machine learning.© The Author(s) 2025.

The researchers studied a family with several members who developed a unique syndrome characterized by loss of body fat (lipodystrophy), abnormal fat deposits (lipomatosis), severe liver inflammation in infancy (infantile steatohepatitis), and low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). By analyzing the genetic makeup of this family, the researchers identified a specific mutation in the ACAA2 gene as the underlying cause of this disorder. 

The ACAA2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in fat metabolism. This genetic variant appears to disrupt the normal function of this enzyme, leading to the accumulation of certain fat byproducts in the body and the development of the observed medical problems. Understanding the genetic basis of this rare syndrome is an important step towards improving diagnosis and potentially developing targeted treatments for affected individuals. While more research is needed, this discovery provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetics, fat metabolism, and liver health that can manifest as a debilitating condition during childhood and adulthood.",Gastroenterology,
41484090,2026-01-04,Elevated non-clonal bone marrow plasma cell fraction at diagnosis is associated with improved outcomes in multiple myeloma.,"In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), current risk stratification relies on cytogenetics and disease burden, but emerging immune parameters may refine prognosis. While a higher non-clonal plasma cell fraction (NCPF) predicts favorable outcomes in smoldering myeloma, its relevance in NDMM remains unexplored. We retrospectively analyzed 798 patients with NDMM where baseline bone marrow aspirates were tested to determine the NCPF, defined as the proportion of non-clonal plasma cells among total plasma cells. An NCPF ≥ 5% defined the NCPF-Enriched group. NCPF-High was observed in 124 patients (15.5% of all cohort). Compared to NCPF-Low, NCPF-Enriched patients had lower overall bone marrow plasma cell burden (median 20% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001), higher rates of hyperdiploidy (71% vs. 59%, p = 0.025), and similar cytogenetic risk. Six-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in NCPF-Enriched (70.3% vs. 56.5%, p = 0.0096), with independent prognostic value in multivariable analysis (HR 0.64, p = 0.03). Progression-free survival was also superior (HR 0.69, p = 0.006) in the NCPF-Enriched cohort in the setting of comparable treatment approaches. A higher non-clonal plasma cell fraction at diagnosis is independently associated with improved outcomes in NDMM, highlighting its potential as a novel immune prognostic biomarker warranting further investigation.© 2026.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against children (SVAC) are two major forms of such abuse. Despite their wide-reaching effects on individual and community health, these risk factors have not been adequately prioritised as key drivers of global health burden. Comprehensive x§and reliable estimates of the comparative health burden of IPV and SVAC are urgently needed to inform investments in prevention and support for survivors at both national and global levels.We estimated the prevalence and attributable burden of IPV among females and SVAC among males and females for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2023, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2023. We searched several global databases for data on self-reported exposure to IPV and SVAC and undertook a systematic review to identify the health outcomes associated with each of these risk factors. We modelled IPV and SVAC prevalence using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, applying data adjustments to account for measurement heterogeneity. We employed burden-of-proof methodology to estimate relative risks for outcomes associated with IPV and SVAC. These estimates informed the calculation of population attributable fractions, which were then used to quantify disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to each risk factor.Globally, in 2023, we estimated that 608 million (95% uncertainty interval 518-724) females aged 15 years and older had ever been exposed to IPV, and 1·01 billion (0·764-1·48) individuals aged 15 years and older had experienced sexual violence during childhood. 18·5 million (8·74-30·0) DALYs were attributed to IPV among females and 32·2 million (16·4-52·5) DALYs were attributed to SVAC among males and females in 2023. IPV and SVAC were among the top contributors to the global disease burden in 2023, particularly among females aged 15-49 years, ranking as the fourth and fifth leading risk factors, respectively, for DALYs in this group. Among the eight health outcomes found to be associated with IPV, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder were the leading causes of IPV-attributed DALYs, accounting for 5·43 million (-1·25 to 14·6) and 3·96 million (1·71 to 6·92) DALYs in 2023, respectively. SVAC was associated with 14 health outcomes, including mental health disorder, substance use disorder, and chronic and infectious disease outcomes. Self-harm and schizophrenia were the leading causes of SVAC-attributed burden, with SVAC accounting for 6·71 million (2·00 to 12·7) DALYs due to self-harm and 4·15 million (-1·92 to 13·1) DALYs due to schizophrenia in 2023.IPV and SVAC are substantial contributors to global health burden, and their health consequences span a variety of individual health outcomes. Importantly, mental health disorders account for the greatest share of disease burden among survivors. Investing in prevention of these avoidable risk factors has the potential to avert millions of DALYs and considerable premature mortality each year. Our findings represent strong evidence for global and national leaders to elevate IPV and SVAC among public health priorities. Sustained investments are needed to prevent IPV and SVAC and to implement interventions focused on supporting the complex social and health needs of survivors.Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

Safety data on revaccination among people with previous cardiac AEFIs are lacking. This study assessed outcomes of COVID-19 revaccination among participants assessed for cardiac AEFIs.The Special Immunization Clinic Network database, containing data from consented participants across twelve sites, was analyzed. Cases were classified using the Brighton Collaboration Case Definitions (BCCDs) for mutually exclusive diagnoses of myocarditis, myopericarditis or pericarditis. Subjects with cardiac symptoms not meeting the BCCD and with no alternative diagnosis were categorized as chest pain/other cardiac diagnosis. Revaccination recommendations were based on physician judgment, informed by national guidelines. Participants were followed up to 42 days after revaccination to capture AEFI recurrence.Between January 1, 2021 and February 23, 2023, 114 participants were enrolled, including 46 with myocarditis (40.4 %), 26 (22.8 %) with myopericarditis, 11 (9.6 %) with pericarditis, and 31 (27.1 %) with chest pain/other cardiac diagnosis. Twenty-seven of 71 participants (38.0 %) who required further COVID-19 vaccine doses were recommended for revaccination.

41485178,2026-01-05,Psilocybin and Bipolar Depression: Promise and Prudence.,"Bipolar disorder affects approximately 40 million individuals worldwide, with depression being the most prominent phase of the illness. Owing to limited treatment options, bipolar depression remains a major public health concern, often causing significant functional impairment and increased suicide risk. Current therapies frequently lack rapid effectiveness, highlighting the need for novel approaches. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound receiving growing interest for its potential rapid antidepressant effects, is under investigation in clinical trials combined with psychotherapy. Early studies in bipolar II disorder (n = 19) show encouraging results, but evidence is still limited, and important safety concerns such as affective switching and pharmacokinetic interactions persist. Additional challenges include regulatory restrictions, infrastructure demands, and uncertainties about the role of the psychedelic experience, especially given possible interference by common bipolar medications. Cautious, rigorous research is essential to determine psilocybin's safety, efficacy, and practical application in bipolar depression, particularly for bipolar I disorder and long-term outcomes.© 2026.

While some inflammatory responses may originate from mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), nonimmune cells vastly outnumber MNPs and may be an important source of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that highly virulent EBOV induced a high and sustained pro-inflammatory response compared to less virulent ebolaviruses in non-MNPs through TLR4-independent NF-κB activation. We identified the EBOV matrix protein VP40 as a potent activator of NF-κB in non-MNPs, whose intrinsic inflammatory activation ability is higher than VP40 proteins from less virulent ebolaviruses. This suggests that VP40 is a virulence determinant inducing distinct degrees of pro-inflammatory responses among ebolaviruses. Mechanistically, VP40 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, primarily via TNFR1 using a ligand-independent mechanism. These findings reveal mechanisms that may drive systemic inflammation and promote EBOV pathogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate immune dysregulation in severe EBOV infections.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Satoko Yamaoka|Zeineb M'Hamdi|Lin Wang|Vaille A Swenson|Kristin L McNally|Shao-Chia C Lu|Reema Singh|Stephanie L Saundh|Brady N Zell|Sonja M Best|Michael A Barry|Angela L Rasmussen|Hideki Ebihara,Satoko Yamaoka|Lin Wang|Vaille A Swenson|Shao-Chia C Lu|Brady N Zell|Michael A Barry,"Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E3, Canada.|Virology and Gene Therapy Track, Mayo Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, MN 55905.|Laboratory of Virology, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840.|Laboratory of Neurological Infections and Immunity, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E3, Canada.|Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794.|Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan Institute for Health Security, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan.","Satoko Yamaoka, Zeineb M'Hamdi, Lin Wang, Vaille A Swenson, Kristin L McNally, Shao-Chia C Lu, Reema Singh, Stephanie L Saundh, Brady N Zell, Sonja M Best, Michael A Barry, Angela L Rasmussen, Hideki Ebihara",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461033/,"Ebola is a deadly virus that causes severe illness and often leads to death.

41130385,2026-01-06,Comparative performance of Scribe and database search engines in metaproteomic profiling of a ground-truth microbiome dataset.,"Mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics, the identification and quantification of thousands of proteins expressed by complex microbial communities, has become pivotal for unraveling functional interactions within microbiomes. However, metaproteomics data analysis encounters many challenges, including the search of tandem mass spectra against a protein sequence database using proteomics database search algorithms. We used a ground-truth dataset to assess a spectral library searching method against established database searching approaches. Mass spectrometry data collected by data-dependent acquisition (DDA-MS) was analyzed using database searching approaches (MaxQuant and FragPipe), as well as using Scribe with Prosit predicted spectral libraries. We used FASTA databases that included protein sequences from microbial species present in the ground-truth dataset along with background protein sequences, to estimate error rates and assess the effects on detection, peptide-spectral match quality, and quantification. Using the Scribe search engine resulted in more proteins detected at a 1 % false discovery rate (FDR) compared to MaxQuant or FragPipe, while FragPipe detected more peptides verified by PepQuery. Scribe was able to detect more low-abundance proteins in the microbiome dataset and was more accurate in quantifying the microbial community composition. This research provides insights and guidance for metaproteomics researchers aiming to optimize results in their analysis of DDA-MS data. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Metaproteomics requires a balance between high numbers of peptide and protein identification and confidence in the accuracy of the identifications made. We demonstrate the utility of the Scribe search engine for metaproteomics applications, as it was found to detect low-abundance proteins with accurate quantitation than other DDA-MS search engines. This tool has great utility for both novel metaproteomics studies as well as hypothesis-generating experiments using previously acquired open source proteomics raw data.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers wanted to create a 3D computer simulation that generates highly detailed, lifelike ultrasound images from CT scans of the patient's anatomy. 

They used a progressive training approach, starting with basic simulations and gradually increasing the complexity to match real-world conditions. This allowed them to build an advanced simulator that can accurately mimic the appearance and behavior of organs, tissues, and kidney stones during the procedure. By training on this realistic 3D model, doctors can hone their skills and become more confident before operating on a real patient.

Patient osteoporosis status was determined according to the National Bone Health Alliance criteria. We report survival free from revision (implant removal or replacement) and all-cause reoperation (including revisions) in these groups. We used cluster-robust, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to analyze osteoporosis as a risk factor for revision and all-cause reoperation and report subgroup analysis for pyrocarbon and silicone implants.The osteoporosis group included 200 joints (168 silicone, 32 pyrocarbon) in 56 patients with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years. The nonosteoporosis group included 129 joints (93 silicone, 36 pyrocarbon) in 42 patients with a mean follow-up of 10 years. With pyrocarbon implants, the osteoporosis group had lower 10-year survival free from revision (58% vs 100%) and all-cause reoperation (40% vs. 81%) than the nonosteoporosis group. In multivariable analysis of pyrocarbon implants, osteoporosis was associated with increased hazard for revision (HR, 11.0; 95% CI, 1.27-95.8) and all-cause reoperation (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-10.3). With silicone implants, there was no difference in 10-year survival free from revision (88% in osteoporosis, 89% in nonosteoporosis) or all-cause reoperation (85% osteoporosis, 85% nonosteoporosis). Osteoporosis did not affect risk for silicone implant revision or reoperation.Osteoporosis is associated with increased risk for pyrocarbon implant revision and all-cause reoperation in RA patients, though the precise effect size is unknown.

Limited in vitro data suggest compatibility of 0.05% CHG with antibiotic impregnated IPP devices; however, very little clinical research exists to guide use of 0.05% CHG in this population.Assess the relationship of 0.05% CHG and antibiotic impregnated IPP infection in a large multi-institutional cohort.We retrospectively reviewed a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent antibiotic impregnated IPP implantation. We identified cases using intraoperative 0.05% CHG and an equal number of consecutive control cases without 0.05% CHG use from each center for comparison. The primary outcome was IPP infection requiring explantation. Patient demographics and surgical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression to identify variables associated with infection.The primary outcome was IPP infection requiring device explanation.Among 14 participating institutions, 761 cases using an antibiotic impregnated IPP were analyzed. Of these, 348 (45.7%) had 0.05% CHG used during the case. Median follow-up was 4 months (interquartile range 1-12) for the 0.05% CHG group and 8 months (interquartile range 2-21) for the control group.Intraoperative 0.05% CHG utilization was not associated with antibiotic impregnated IPP infection rate (1.9% vs. 2.0%, P = .9). On multivariable analysis, prior IPP infection (OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.32-30.2, P = .021) and prior priapism (OR 10.01, 95% CI 1.18-89.7, P = .039) were associated with increased infection risk.The use of 0.05% CHG irrigation with antibiotic impregnated IPPs was associated with similar infection rates compared to antibiotic irrigation.Limitations include the use of a historical comparator cohort which may introduce unknown confounders, practice variation between multiple sites, shorter follow-up in the 0.05% CHG cohort, and the low incidence of IPP infection which may limit statistical power despite a large sample.

These studies serve multiple epidemiological purposes: characterizing population health, monitoring temporal trends through repeated surveys, and evaluating interventions via interrupted time series designs. They also offer practical advantages for validating self-reported measures and creating diagnostic models. Cross-sectional designs are efficient and well-suited to descriptive epidemiology, but they have limited utility for causal inference. The simultaneous measurement of exposures and outcomes creates temporal ambiguity that fundamentally constrains etiologic interpretation. However, causal inferences can be strengthened under specific conditions-when temporal sequence is unambiguous (e.g., genetic variants preceding outcomes) or when valid instrumental variables are available.

Tissue biopsies involved by ECD are difficult to distinguish from reactive inflammatory infiltrates given the bland appearance of the neoplastic histiocytes. Confirmation of the ECD diagnosis often relies on molecular studies to confirm BRAF V600E mutation or other activating mutations involving MAPK pathway genes. In this study, we examined the diagnostic utility of cyclin D1 and pERK as immunohistochemical markers of MAPK pathway activation in ECD compared with its histopathologic mimics. The cohort included 41 clinically confirmed ECD patients, most with known genetic alterations in MAPK pathway genes (n=38). In 3 cases no mutation was identified. 37 of 41 (90%) of ECD cases showed cyclin D1 overexpression, with frequent staining in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. pERK expression was observed in 32 of 39 (82%) cases. Cyclin D1 staining was negative in histopathologic mimics of ECD, apart from weak patchy staining in fat necrosis and uniform staining in a subset of cases of juvenile/adult xanthogranuloma. While not entirely sensitive or specific, in the proper clinical and radiologic context strong nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin D1 expression within histiocytic infiltrates helps to support a diagnosis of ECD.Copyright © 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41059926,2026-01-07,Discovery and Validation of Molecular Biomarkers for Differentiation of Nondysplastic Barrett's Esophagus from High-grade Dysplasia and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,"Aberrant DNA methylation and copy-number alterations (CNA) drive Barrett's esophagus progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, their combined utility for early detection is unclear. We aimed to identify and validate methylated DNA markers (MDM) and CNAs to distinguish esophageal adenocarcinoma/high-grade dysplasia (HGD) from nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE). In this multiphase, multicenter study, we discovered and validated MDMs and quantified CNAs utilizing whole-genome methylation sequencing of esophageal brushings. DNA biomarkers identified from discovery were further validated in independent patients with paired esophageal brushing and swallowed capsule sponge samples. MDMs were filtered against a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset obtained from independent tissue samples to advance only concordant candidates. CNA burden was quantified using ichorCNA-derived aneuploidy scores (AS). Two hundred MDMs discovered in HGD (N = 18) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (N = 18) versus NDBE brushing samples (N = 18) were tested in independent samples (N = 146). A 52-MDM panel achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.95]; the addition of AS improved discrimination of HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from NDBE to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97) AUC. At 80% specificity, the combined model detected 93% of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 88% of HGD cases. In paired capsule sponge samples, a 58-MDM panel achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.88); a combined 58-MDM and AS model achieved AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.7-0.9). MDMs and AS discerned HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from normal esophagus/NDBE in endoscopic brushing and capsule sponge samples. This approach may improve Barrett's esophagus surveillance.This study demonstrates that combining epigenetic and genomic biomarkers across minimally invasive sampling methods can accurately distinguish HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma from nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, offering promising, less invasive strategies to improve BE surveillance and enable endoscopic therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma prevention and treatment.©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.","Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)","Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Calise K Berger|Caryn E Anderson|Melissa A Passe|Ramona M Lansing|Panwen Wang|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Jeanette E Eckel-Passow|Zhifu Sun|Douglas W Mahoney|D C Codipilly|Cadman L Leggett|Francisco C Ramirez|Allon Kahn|Herbert C Wolfsen|Swathi Eluri|Vani JA Konda|Arvind J Trindade|Prasad G Iyer|John B Kisiel,Caroline L Matchett|Seth W Slettedahl|William R Taylor|Calise K Berger|Caryn E Anderson|Melissa A Passe|Ramona M Lansing|Panwen Wang|Collin E Chalmers|Patrick H Foote|Jeanette E Eckel-Passow|Zhifu Sun|Douglas W Mahoney|D C Codipilly|Cadman L Leggett|Francisco C Ramirez|Allon Kahn|Herbert C Wolfsen|Swathi Eluri|Prasad G Iyer|John B Kisiel,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.|Division of Computational Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor Scott and White Health, Dallas, Texas.|Division of Gastroenterology, Rutgers University School of Medicine, New Brunswick, New Jersey.","Caroline L Matchett, Seth W Slettedahl, William R Taylor, Calise K Berger, Caryn E Anderson, Melissa A Passe, Ramona M Lansing, Panwen Wang, Collin E Chalmers, Patrick H Foote, Jeanette E Eckel-Passow, Zhifu Sun, Douglas W Mahoney, D C Codipilly, Cadman L Leggett, Francisco C Ramirez, Allon Kahn, Herbert C Wolfsen, Swathi Eluri, Vani JA Konda, Arvind J Trindade, Prasad G Iyer, John B Kisiel",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41059926/,"This research aimed to identify and validate new biomarkers that can help distinguish a precancerous condition called high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal cancer from a less severe condition called nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE).

41143601,2026-01-07,Cell-of-Origin Subtype Predicts Response to Polatuzumab Vedotin in Large B-cell Lymphoma.,"Polatuzumab vedotin (polatuzumab) was approved for up-front treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (Pola-R-CHP) based on the POLARIX trial. However, when stratified by cell of origin (COO), polatuzumab seems to have greater efficacy in activated B-cell than germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype disease. Most studies of polatuzumab used RNA expression to assess COO, whereas in routine clinical practice, the immunohistochemistry-based Hans algorithm is used.To assess the impact of COO by immunohistochemistry on polatuzumab efficacy, we conducted a multicenter real-world study of adults with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) receiving polatuzumab from 2015 to 2024, split by receipt of polatuzumab in first-line versus relapsed/refractory settings. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) to polatuzumab-based treatment in GCB versus non-GCB relapsed/refractory LBCL.Of 740 patients, 305 received polatuzumab in the first-line setting and 435 in the relapsed/refractory setting. In the relapsed/refractory cohort, the ORR in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL was 59.7% versus 36.3% [OR, 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-3.84; P < 0.0001], with a complete response rate of 35.7% versus 17.7% (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.66-4.02; P < 0.0001). Progression-free survival was longer for patients with non-GCB versus GCB COO (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.5-0.83; P = 0.0006). In the first-line cohort, ORR, complete response rate, and progression-free survival were similar in non-GCB versus GCB LBCL, as hypothesized based on outcomes in the Pola-R-CHP arm of POLARIX, suggesting that the addition of polatuzumab overcomes the adverse risk of non-GCB COO in patients receiving R-CHOP.Based on these data, COO classification by the Hans algorithm is a strong predictor of polatuzumab efficacy in LBCL, informing real-world treatment decisions.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Edward RS Cliff|Guido D Pelaez|Fei Wan|Varun Iyengar|Jihao Zhou|Kevin Chung|Nayef Abdel-Razeq|Jessica Allen|Ajay Major|John Sharp|Narendranath Epperla|Patrick Gould|Hua-Jay J Cherng|Samin Houshyar|Danielle S Wallace|Ryan C Lynch|Avyakta Kallam|Matthew G Mei|Reid W Merryman|Michelle Fleyshman|Joanna M Rhodes|Adam Kidwell|Timothy S Fenske|Nikita Malakhov|Erin Mulvey|Marcus P Watkins|Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa|Talal Hilal|Grzegorz S Nowakowski|Yucai Wang|Pallawi Torka|David A Russler-Germain,Jihao Zhou|Kevin Chung|Nayef Abdel-Razeq|Samin Houshyar|Danielle S Wallace|Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa|Talal Hilal|Grzegorz S Nowakowski|Yucai Wang,"Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.|Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.|Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.|Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.|Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.|Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California.|Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Brunswick, New Jersey.|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.|Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.|Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.","Edward RS Cliff, Guido D Pelaez, Fei Wan, Varun Iyengar, Jihao Zhou, Kevin Chung, Nayef Abdel-Razeq, Jessica Allen, Ajay Major, John Sharp, Narendranath Epperla, Patrick Gould, Hua-Jay J Cherng, Samin Houshyar, Danielle S Wallace, Ryan C Lynch, Avyakta Kallam, Matthew G Mei, Reid W Merryman, Michelle Fleyshman, Joanna M Rhodes, Adam Kidwell, Timothy S Fenske, Nikita Malakhov, Erin Mulvey, Marcus P Watkins, Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa, Talal Hilal, Grzegorz S Nowakowski, Yucai Wang, Pallawi Torka, David A Russler-Germain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41143601/,"This medical research study looked at how the type of large B-cell lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) affects how well patients respond to a new drug called polatuzumab vedotin.

They found that patients with the non-germinal center B-cell subtype had a much better response to polatuzumab compared to those with the germinal center B-cell subtype when the drug was used to treat relapsed/refractory disease. However, this difference was not seen when polatuzumab was used as an initial treatment. These results suggest that knowing the",Oncology,

The primary objective of this single-arm, open-label phase 2 trial was to determine whether denosumab, a RANKL mAb, improved disease control in recurrent osteosarcoma relative to benchmarks derived from historic Children's Oncology Group clinical trial data.Skeletally mature patients ages 11 to 49 years old with measurable disease were eligible for cohort 1, and those with complete surgical resection of all sites of disease were eligible for cohort 2. Patients received denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The primary endpoints were RECIST response and remaining event-free for 4 months for cohort 1 and remaining event-free for 12 months for cohort 2. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were additional endpoints.Fifteen patients in cohort 1 and 38 in cohort 2 were eligible and evaluable for the primary endpoint. One of 15 cohort 1 patients remained event-free at 4 months. There were no objective responses. Ten of 38 cohort 2 patients were event-free at 12 months. The predefined efficacy criteria were not met in either cohort. The most common ≥ grade 3 adverse events were hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia (8% and 11%, respectively). At steady state, mean serum denosumab trough concentrations were 23.7 to 31 μg/mL in cycles 2 to 7. Serum c-telopeptide and urine n-telopeptide decreased on treatment.Denosumab was well-tolerated with anticipated side effects and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters but had insufficient activity for further development in osteosarcoma.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Katherine A Janeway|Alexander J Chou|Allen Buxton|Joel Reid|Michael S Isakoff|Lisa Kopp|Pooja Hingorani|Jill L Lee|John Doski|Heike Daldrup-Link|Laura Hall|R L Randall|Damon R Reed|Steven G Dubois|Mark Krailo|Holcombe Grier|Richard Gorlick,Joel Reid,"Dana-Farber-Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Weill Cornell Medicine - Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, New York, New York.|Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California.|Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota.|Division of Hematology and Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut.|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.|AbbVie Inc., San Francisco, California.|Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.|UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.|Department of Radiology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Pediatrics (Pediatric Oncology), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University, Stanford, California.|Department of Pediatric Pharmacy, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee.|Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Davis, Davis, California.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.|Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.|Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.","Katherine A Janeway, Alexander J Chou, Allen Buxton, Joel Reid, Michael S Isakoff, Lisa Kopp, Pooja Hingorani, Jill L Lee, John Doski, Heike Daldrup-Link, Laura Hall, R L Randall, Damon R Reed, Steven G Dubois, Mark Krailo, Holcombe Grier, Richard Gorlick",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41159913/,"Osteosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of bone cancer that primarily affects children and young adults.

Clinicopathologic criteria for adjuvant treatment remain imprecise and have not changed for decades. We investigated whether ctDNA in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (""lymph"") 24 hours after surgery identified molecular residual disease (MRD) and compared its performance with time-matched plasma.Using an ultra-sensitive tumor-informed sequencing approach, tumor variants were called in lymph and plasma to classify patients as ctDNA positive or ctDNA negative, trained in an initial cohort of 36 patients, and replicated in an independent cohort of 37 patients. Progression-free survival was compared in ctDNA(+) versus ctDNA(-) patients.Lymph identified MRD in two independent multi-site cohorts (initial cohort sensitivity = 76% and specificity = 63%; log-rank P = 0.01; replication cohort sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 70%; log-rank P = 0.04). Lymph performance was enhanced in locoregional relapse (sensitivity = 78% and specificity = 67%; log-rank P = 0.0004) and generalized to early-stage patients. Analysis of matched plasma collected at this early timepoint was not predictive of recurrence (sensitivity = 35% and specificity = 72%; log-rank P = 0.7). In patients with intermediate-risk pathology, lymph ctDNA was associated with recurrence (sensitivity = 88% and specificity = 67%; log-rank P = 0.0008), suggesting an opportunity for improved stratification of patients who may benefit from additional adjuvant treatment.Postoperative lymph is a novel, proximal, and early source of MRD with the potential to introduce more precision into adjuvant therapy decision-making and improve outcomes, especially for patients with intermediate-risk human papillomavirus-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",Clin Cancer Res,"Jan 06, 2026",2026.0,Jan,6.0,Seka Lazare|Zhuosheng Gu|Noah Earland|Michael A Harmon|Maciej Pacula|Megan Rivera|Ashley Tellis|Damion Whitfield|Adam Benson|Sophie Gerndt|Peter Harris|Lucien Khalil|Ricardo Ramirez|Zhongping Xu|Benjamin Wahle|Sid Puram|Doug Adkins|Wade Thorstad|Daniel Zandberg|Rebecca Chernock|Heath Skinner|Matthew E Spector|Raja Seethala|Robert L Ferris|Joshua D Smith|Amy E Greer|Ellen L Verner|Andrew Georgiadis|Mark Sausen|Shakti H Ramkissoon|Taylor J Jensen|Marra S Francis|Wendy Winckler|Aadel A Chaudhuri|Jose P Zevallos,Aadel A Chaudhuri,"Droplet Biosciences, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.|Labcorp, Baltimore, Maryland.|Labcorp, Durham, North Carolina.|Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.|Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.|Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Seka Lazare, Zhuosheng Gu, Noah Earland, Michael A Harmon, Maciej Pacula, Megan Rivera, Ashley Tellis, Damion Whitfield, Adam Benson, Sophie Gerndt, Peter Harris, Lucien Khalil, Ricardo Ramirez, Zhongping Xu, Benjamin Wahle, Sid Puram, Doug Adkins, Wade Thorstad, Daniel Zandberg, Rebecca Chernock, Heath Skinner, Matthew E Spector, Raja Seethala, Robert L Ferris, Joshua D Smith, Amy E Greer, Ellen L Verner, Andrew Georgiadis, Mark Sausen, Shakti H Ramkissoon, Taylor J Jensen, Marra S Francis, Wendy Winckler, Aadel A Chaudhuri, Jose P Zevallos",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182409/,"This medical research study focused on a common and serious problem in head and neck cancer - the recurrence of the disease after initial treatment.

They compared this approach to analyzing blood samples taken at the same time. 

The researchers found that analyzing the lymph fluid was much better at identifying patients who were at higher risk of their cancer returning, compared to the blood samples. This was true across two separate groups of patients, and was especially helpful for detecting cancer recurrence in the same area as the original tumor. Importantly, the lymph fluid analysis was able to identify high-risk patients even when standard clinical factors suggested an intermediate risk.

41213103,2026-01-07,A Phase II Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Doses of a Folate Receptor Alpha Vaccine in Patients with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"CD4 T-cell immunity is associated with improved survival in patients with breast cancer. We previously reported a phase I trial evaluating a folate receptor alpha (FRα) vaccine administered with cyclophosphamide (CP), demonstrating excellent safety and immunogenicity. To simplify the vaccine strategy for ease of use, we report here the results of a randomized phase II trial evaluating a lower vaccine dose alongside the original dose, administered with or without CP pretreatment.Patients with triple-negative breast cancer who completed all systemic and local therapies were assigned to receive either low-dose (825 μg) or high-dose (2.5 mg) vaccine peptides plus GM-CSF in six 4-week cycles, with or without CP prior to vaccination. Safety was monitored, and immunogenicity was evaluated before and after vaccination.A total of 80 patients were dosed with vaccine, and 58 patients were evaluable for immunogenicity. Vaccination was well tolerated and elicited immunity in 83% of patients. Levels of FRα-specific T cells were high, persistent, and comparable with T-cell levels against tetanus toxoid. No differences in immunity were observed between the two doses. CP pretreatment also did not affect the immune responses. Recurrences occurred in eight evaluable patients and were unrelated to the treatment arm. No patients died during the study because of their disease.The reduced-dose FRα vaccine is as effective as the original dose and does not require CP to generate maximal immunity.

This study aimed to characterize the underlying aetiology, and outcomes of invasively treated young patients with TBAD, with a focus on the impact of heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD).A retrospective multicentre analysis was conducted across 19 international aortic centres, including 139 patients aged ≤30 years with TBAD. Patients with chronic TBAD (n = 42) were excluded for the final analysis. The cohort was classified as uncomplicated (n = 86) or complicated (n = 53) TBAD. Clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected using standardized forms. Outcomes were compared between subgroups defined by TBAD complexity, HTAD status, and surgical strategy. Kaplan-Meier and Andersen-Gill analyses were used for survival and recurrent aortic intervention, respectively.Mean follow-up time was 6.5 years. HTAD was identified in 57% of patients. Most presented with uncomplicated TBAD (62%), while high-risk uncomplicated cases were uncommon. Endovascular repair was predominant in complicated TBAD, while open repair was more frequent in uncomplicated cases. Early mortality was low (n = 3), and mid-term survival was excellent across all subgroups. HTAD was a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions (HR = 3.3, P = .004). No significant differences were observed in survival or reintervention rates between uncomplicated and complicated TBAD or between operative strategies.In young patients, TBAD predominantly occurs in the context of HTAD. Both open and endovascular repair are associated with excellent early outcomes and mid-term survival. However, HTAD remains a significant predictor of recurrent aortic interventions.© The Author(s) 2025.

Associations of demographics, body mass index (BMI), clinical, and biochemical hypercortisolism severity, subtype of hypercortisolism, pre-surgical hypercortisolism duration, glucocorticoid type, and nadir cortisol in relation to duration of AI were investigated.The 242 patients [41% MACS, 46% pituitary CS, 12% adrenal CS, 1% ectopic CS, median age 50 years (IQR: 40-60), 85% women] who developed postsurgical AI were followed for a median duration of 13.7 months (IQR 7.2-26.3). The median time to recovery of AI was shorter in MACS vs. overt CS (3.9 months (95% CI: 3.3-6.2) vs. 13.5 months (95% CI 11.3-18.3), P value < .001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and glucocorticoid type, moderate to severe biochemical severity score (β = 11, P value < .001) and moderate to severe clinical severity score (β=8.7, P < .001), were associated with a longer duration of AI.Baseline clinical and biochemical hypercortisolism severity scores may inform individualized counseling on post-operative AI duration in patients treated for CS and MACS.© The Author(s) 2025.

The researchers compared the responses of three different language models, evaluating factors like the accuracy and appropriateness of the content, the quality of the citations used, and the readability of the text. They found that one model, called OpenEvidence, performed the best, providing summaries that were more accurate and cited higher-quality research studies compared to the other models. Interestingly, when the researchers showed the best chatbot-generated summary to experienced colorectal surgeons, the doctors had difficulty distinguishing it from the actual expert consensus document.

The optimal access route-transgastric (TG) versus transduodenal (TD)-remains uncertain. We compared outcomes of TG versus TD EUS-GBD at a high-volume tertiary center.We included patients who underwent EUS-GBD between January 2020 and December 2024. Baseline demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes data were collected. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as resolution of cholecystitis or relief of biliary obstruction. Secondary outcomes included stent misdeployment, adverse events (AEs), and need for endoscopic reintervention. Comparisons were performed using the unpaired T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact test, with significance at p < 0.05.We included 82 patients (mean age 72 years, 48% female). The indication for drainage was cholecystitis for 45 (55%) patients and MDBO with a patent cystic duct and prior failed ERCP for 37 (45%) patients. Sixty-four (78%) patients underwent transduodenal (TD) EUS-GBD and 18 (22%) underwent transgastric (TG) EUS-GBD. There was no difference between the two groups for clinical success (TD 89% vs. TG 94%, p = 0.68) overall nor when evaluated by procedural indication. There were five (8%) cases of stent misdeployment in the TD EUS-GBD group and zero cases in the TG EUS-GBD group (p = 0.58), all of which were salvaged endoscopically. There were no significant differences between groups for AEs (20% vs. 17%, p =  > 0.99) or unplanned endoscopic reintervention (16% vs. 11%, p =  > 0.99).Both TG and TD EUS-GBD are effective and relatively safe, supporting an individualized approach based on technical feasibility and future surgical candidacy. A potential trend toward more misdeployments in the TD EUS-GBD group warrants further study.© 2025.

The researchers analyzed data on over 1 million surgical procedures to see if there were any links between extreme weather and complications like infections, organ failure, or death. They found that certain types of extreme weather, like prolonged heatwaves, were associated with a small but statistically significant increase in negative outcomes for patients. This suggests that extreme weather may indeed have an impact on postoperative health, though the exact mechanisms are still unclear. The findings highlight the need for hospitals to have emergency plans in place to maintain high-quality care during extreme weather events.

41493809,2026-01-07,Senolytic Changes in Murine Arteriovenous Fistulas with CKD.,"Hemodialysis therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requires suitable vascular access, most commonly the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Forty percent of AVFs fail within one year, leading to morbidity and care costs. Failure mechanisms remain unclear and current therapies are inadequate. Cellular senescence may be critical in AVF failure, and ESKD itself may accelerate senescence and subsequent vascular dysfunction. Senescence follows AVF placement in rodents with normal kidney function, but the temporal and spatial features in uremic conditions are unknown. This study aimed to characterize AVF changes in uremic mice over time and versus control vessels.Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL6/J mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy. Twenty-eight days later an AVF was created by cuff anastomosis (right carotid artery to the right jugular vein). Transcriptomic analysis was performed seven days post-AVF, and further samples were collected at fourteen and twenty-eight days post-AVF creation for histological assessment.AVF outflow vein morphometry showed reduced neointimal cell density. Whole transcriptomic analysis of outflow vs control veins at seven days post-AVF placement revealed 1187 upregulated and 3256 downregulated genes. Differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in two established senescence related gene sets, SenMayo (a curated panel of ∼125 genes validated across species to capture senescence and associated proteins) and SenSig (a broader panel assessed to represent fibrotic and stress induced cell response). Histologically, senescence markers p16, p21, and phospho53 increased between day 14 and 28. Genes common to our dataset, SenMayo, and SenSig were validated with qPCR.These data support established markers of AVF failure like matrix-metalloproteinases and monocyte chemokines and identify potential novel modulators of AVF survival that may inform senolytic strategies to improve patency. In summary, this study reveals for the first time the chronological progression of vascular senescence in the AVF of uremic mice.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

The researchers used mice with kidney disease to study what happens in the blood vessels after a fistula is created. They found that the cells lining the fistula's vein start to show signs of ""senescence"" - a state of aged, dysfunctional cells. This cellular senescence increased over time and was accompanied by changes in gene expression patterns associated with aging and stress.

41494644,2026-01-07,Multi-omics Alterations Associated with Tolerance and Response to Simulated Progressive Hemorrhage in Healthy Adult Humans.,"Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of preventable death among military and civilian trauma patients. While caused by severe hypovolemia, the threshold of blood volume reduction that triggers recruitment of compensatory mechanisms varies markedly. Individuals have been classified as having low (LT) or high (HT) tolerance to hypovolemia; however, molecular features contributing to tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate multi-omics correlates of hypovolemia tolerance and molecular responses underlying physiologic compensating mechanisms of blood loss. Healthy adult human subjects (n=133) recruited from two sites underwent lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to simulate progressive hemorrhage. The primary outcome variable was hemodynamic instability accompanied by onset of decompensated shock defined by systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg. Participants were classified into HT (n=90) and LT (n=43) subjects using a Cumulative Stress Index quantifying maximal LBNP tolerance. Genome-wide mRNA, microRNA, whole-exome sequencing, and select protein abundances were assayed using blood samples collected immediately before and after LBNP procedure. LBNP produced extensive transcriptomic response at post- compared to pre-LBNP, including natural killer cell mediated immunity activation and gas transport processes inhibition. Differentially expressed miRNAs also regulated these enriched processes. Tolerance group specific signals include alpha-beta T cell activation and MHC class II protein complex assembly inhibition in HT group. Integrated analysis of multiple molecular layers demonstrated a role of cytokines and epigenetic regulators in molecular mechanisms of compensating to progressive hemorrhage.

Previously we showed that TNFα induces an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response involving autophosphorylation of inositol requiring enzyme 1α at serine 724 (pIRE1αS724) and alternative splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s). XBP1s transcriptionally activates expression of Cyclin dependent kinases 1 and 5 (CDK1 and CDK5). In the present study, we hypothesized that TNFα induced activation of the pIRE1αS724/XBP1s ER stress pathway mediates transcriptional activation of Cyclin B1 and ASM cell proliferation. Human ASM (hASM) cells were dissociated from bronchiolar tissue samples obtained from female and male patients with no history of respiratory disease. Isolated hASM cells were either treated or untreated with TNFα (20 ng/ mL) for 6 h. For loss of function experiments, hASM cells were either treated with 4μ8C, a pharmacological inhibitor of IRE1α endoribonuclease activity or transfected with a non-spliceable XBP1 mutant (δXBP1). The binding site sequences of XBP1s to the CCNB1 (Cyclin B1 gene) promoter was identified by bioinformatic analysis and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. hASM cell proliferation was measured using a CyQuant cell proliferation assay. TNFα induced pIRE1αS724 phosphorylation and XBP1s splicing in hASM cells. XBP1 transcriptionally activates expression of Cyclin B1 mRNA and protein. Nuclear localization of Cyclin B1 increased significantly in TNFα treated hASM cells consistent with the formation of Cyclin B1/CDKs complexes, and increased cell proliferation. Inhibition of pIRE1αS724/XBP1s pathway mitigated TNFα induced Cyclin B1 and CDKs expression and hASM cell proliferation.",American journal of physiology.

41499724,2026-01-08,OCT-Based Differentiation of First Acute Optic Neuritis: An International Study of 111 Patients With NMOSD and MOGAD.,"Severe optic neuritis (ON) is a common clinical manifestation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Given distinct prognoses and often the necessity of early plasma exchange in NMOSD, prompt differentiation is crucial. In this study, we investigated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in differentiating between first acute NMOSD-ON and MOGAD-associated optic neuritis (MOGAD-ON), as well as specific factors associated with disc edema.In this retrospective multicenter study, 111 adult patients with MOGAD or aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD who experienced a first ON and underwent OCT within 2 weeks of symptom onset were included from 14 centers across 8 countries. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in µm was analyzed, including the average of both eyes in cases of bilateral manifestation.Eighty-three patients with MOGAD (51 women; 124 ON eyes; bilateral ON 48.2%) and 28 with NMOSD (24 women; 36 ON eyes; bilateral ON 21.4%) were enrolled. A significant increase in pRNFL thickness (>2SD), suggestive of disc edema, was observed in 73.4% of MOGAD-ON eyes and 11.1% of NMOSD-ON eyes (p < 0.001). The pRNFL thickness cutoff of 117.5 µm provided 92.9% specificity and 71.1% sensitivity in distinguishing between MOGAD-ON and NMOSD-ON (area under the curve = 0.838). There was no association between pRNFL thickening and MOG-IgG titer (high vs low), body mass index, or the delay between ON onset and OCT. Simultaneous bilateral MOGAD-ON was associated with significantly more pronounced pRNFL thickening.Acute-stage OCT contributes to the rapid and accurate differentiation between MOGAD-ON and NMOSD-ON prior to antibody confirmation, which can be critical for timely therapeutic decisions.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,"Mar, 2026",2026.0,Mar,,Thivya Pakeerathan|James Davis|Amanda D Henderson|Elias S Sotirchos|Yana Said|Joachim Havla|Marius Ringelstein|Orhan Aktas|Margit Weise|Jonathan A Gernert|Barbara Kornek|Gabriel Bsteh|Paulus S Rommer|Nik Krajnc|Anne-Katrin K Pröbstel|Athina Papadopoulou|Laila Kulsvehagen|Roxanne Pretzsch|Kean Schoenholzer|Tanyatuth Padungkiatsagul|Heather E Moss|Sylvia E Villarreal Navarro|Marina Herwerth|Madalina Graure|Veronika Kana|Hadas Stiebel-Kalish|Rita Zlatkin|Anthony C Arnold|Laura Bonelli|Jan-Patrick P Stellmann|Natacha Stolowy|Carolin Schwake|Christiane Schneider-Gold|Tania Kümpfel|Philipp Albrecht|Natthapon Rattanathamsakul|Sean J Pittock|Eoin P Flanagan|Sara Carta|Sara Mariotto|Ralf Gold|John J Chen|Ilya Ayzenberg,Natthapon Rattanathamsakul|Sean J Pittock|Eoin P Flanagan|John J Chen,"Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.|Division of Neuro-Ophthalmology, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Department of Neurology, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, LMU University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Center for Neurology and Neuropsychiatry, LVR-Klinikum, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany.|Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.|Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neurosciences and Mental Health, Austria.|Departments of Biomedicine and of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Research Center of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel (RC2NB), University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Center of Neurology, Department of Neuroimmunology, University Hospital and University Bonn, Germany.|German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.|Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Translational Imaging in Neurology (ThINk) Basel, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.|Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, CA.|Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.|Neuro-ophthalmology Division Department of Ophthalmology, Rabin Medical Center and, Laboratory of Eye Research, Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel.|Department of Ophthalmology, UCLA Stein Eye Institute, Los Angeles, CA.|APHM, Hopital de la Timone, CEMEREM, Marseille, France.|Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CRMBM, Marseille, France.|Department of Ophthalmology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de La Timone, Marseille, France.|Department of Neurology, Kliniken Maria Hilf Mönchengladbach, Germany.|Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Thailand.|Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Italy.","Thivya Pakeerathan, James Davis, Amanda D Henderson, Elias S Sotirchos, Yana Said, Joachim Havla, Marius Ringelstein, Orhan Aktas, Margit Weise, Jonathan A Gernert, Barbara Kornek, Gabriel Bsteh, Paulus S Rommer, Nik Krajnc, Anne-Katrin K Pröbstel, Athina Papadopoulou, Laila Kulsvehagen, Roxanne Pretzsch, Kean Schoenholzer, Tanyatuth Padungkiatsagul, Heather E Moss, Sylvia E Villarreal Navarro, Marina Herwerth, Madalina Graure, Veronika Kana, Hadas Stiebel-Kalish, Rita Zlatkin, Anthony C Arnold, Laura Bonelli, Jan-Patrick P Stellmann, Natacha Stolowy, Carolin Schwake, Christiane Schneider-Gold, Tania Kümpfel, Philipp Albrecht, Natthapon Rattanathamsakul, Sean J Pittock, Eoin P Flanagan, Sara Carta, Sara Mariotto, Ralf Gold, John J Chen, Ilya Ayzenberg",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41499724/,"This research study aimed to help doctors quickly distinguish between two serious eye conditions - optic neuritis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD) and optic neuritis associated with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

We evaluated the real-world effectiveness of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D after myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke and examined trends and disparities.Using nationwide Czech registry data (2015-2024), we identified patients with incident nonfatal MI or ischemic stroke and confirmed T2D. GLP-1RA users-initiating therapy within 12 months post-event-were propensity score-matched to non-users. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death); secondary outcomes included individual components and all-cause mortality.GLP-1RA therapy was initiated in only ∼2% of MI and stroke survivors with T2D. Among 126,845 MI survivors, 28,206 had T2D; the matched cohort comprised 2,271 patients (401 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 35 months). GLP-1RA use was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.7; 95%CI:0.52-0.93), all-cause (HR:0.61;95%CI:0.47-0.80) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.54, 95%CI:0.36-0.80). Among 177,115 stroke survivors, 73,750 had T2D; the matched cohort comprised 2,235 patients (385 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 27 months). GLP-1RA use was associated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.71; 95%CI:0.54-0.94), all-cause (HR:0.59;95%CI:0.46-0.76) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.55; 95%CI:0.37-0.81).GLP-1RA therapy after MI or stroke in T2D was associated with substantially lower risks of MACE, cardiovascular and all-cause death in real-world practice. Utilization remained low, particularly among women and older adults, underscoring the need for broader and more equitable implementation in secondary prevention.© The Author(s) 2026.

40884219,2026-01-08,AAV9-mediated KCNH2 suppression-replacement gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of type 1 short QT syndrome.,"Type 1 short QT syndrome (SQT1) is a genetic channelopathy caused by gain-of-function variants in KCNH2, resulting in shortened cardiac repolarization and QT intervals, which predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of KCNH2-specific suppression-and-replacement (KCNH2-SupRep) gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of SQT1.KCNH2-SupRep was developed by combining a KCNH2-shRNA with its corresponding shRNA-immune KCNH2-cDNA into an AAV9 vector, delivered directly into the aortic root (1 × 1010 vg/kg). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo by electrocardiogram, ex vivo by optical mapping, and at cellular levels by patch-clamp, calcium imaging, and qPCR in ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs).In vivo, KCNH2-SupRep normalized the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) in SQT1 rabbits, without affecting repolarization heterogeneity. Ex vivo, KCNH2-SupRep corrected the action potential duration (APD90) and resolved the increased apicobasal APD90 heterogeneity observed in untreated (UT)-SQT1 hearts, supporting an antiarrhythmic effect, which was further validated by reduced re-entry formation in silico. At cellular levels, KCNH2-SupRep prolonged APD90 in VCMs from SupRep-SQT1 rabbits closer to wildtype levels compared with UT- and sham-SQT1. Additionally, KCNH2-SupRep restored the cellular surrogate of the electro-mechanical window and normalized IKr in nearly 50% of VCMs, in line with a 50%-60% suppression of the mutant KCNH2 transcript.This proof-of-concept study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of gene therapy for SQT1 in a medium-sized animal model.

41498509,2026-01-08,Elevated Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Concentrations Poorly Predict VIPoma.,"VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that is challenging to diagnose. While VIP concentrations are elevated in VIPoma, the optimal threshold for diagnostic purposes is not well defined. We aimed to study this in a single institution population. We obtained results from vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) tests from 2011-2023 and reviewed the medical record for patients who had concentrations greater than our established assay-specific reference limit of 75 pg/mL. We compared plasma VIP concentrations between patient cohorts with and without VIPoma and determined the optimal threshold for VIP concentrations to predict a VIPoma in this population.76 patients met the selection criteria. Of these, nine cases of VIPoma were diagnosed. All patients had chronic diarrhea, and five patients had a previous diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). VIP concentrations drawn for acute/episodic diarrhea or flushing/diaphoresis did not lead to a diagnosis of a VIPoma. Mean VIP concentration was increased in patients with a VIPoma relative to those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (508 pg/mL vs 223 pg/mL, p=0.31). Using the threshold of 75 pg/mL, the positive predictive value for a VIPoma was 12%. The optimal VIP threshold was 442 pg/mL (OR: 11.96, 95% CI: 2.00-79.69, p=0.01) with statistically significant odds ratios starting at 200 pg/mL.

41498520,2026-01-08,Cuff conundrum: inflatable penile prosthesis surgery in men who have transcorporal artificial urinary sphincters.,"Concerns exist regarding inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) placement after transcorporal artificial urinary sphincter (TC-AUS) surgery due to potential risk of damaging the AUS cuff during corporal dilation and device placement.To evaluate perioperative complications, infections, revision rates, and device longevity in patients undergoing IPP placement following prior TC-AUS surgery.We present a case series of men who underwent IPP surgery with an existing TC-AUS in place. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent TC-AUS placement at a single tertiary institution between 2015 and 2025. Patients who subsequently received IPP surgery were identified. Standard IPP techniques were used with additional precautions to protect the AUS, including use of electrocautery instead of sharp dissection and contralateral reservoir placement. Demographics, operative details, complications, infections, revision events, and device survival were collected through review of operative notes and patient records.Primary outcomes included intra-operative difficulties, perioperative complications, infection and erosion rates, and revision or failure rates for both the TC-AUS and IPP devices.Among 757 TC-AUS placements, 17 patients subsequently underwent IPP surgery. Seven patients (41%) had a history of pelvic irradiation. The median operative time for IPP placement was 83 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 68-87), and median follow-up was 31.5 months (IQR 11.2-40.6). All reservoirs were positioned contralateral to the AUS reservoir. A 12 Fr catheter was left postoperatively in 10 patients (59%) for <24 hours. Proximal corporal dilation was noted to be challenging in 3 patients (18%) but dilation was completed without cuff injury or corporal perforation. One patient (6%) had TC-AUS cuff erosion 9.5 months after IPP surgery; one patient (6%) experienced TC-AUS device infection 11.5 months after IPP surgery when his AUD pump eroded through the scrotum. Four patients (24%) developed AUS mechanical failure due to cuff leak at a median of 31.9 months after IPP placement (39.9 months post-AUS).IPP implantation following TC-AUS can be performed safely using careful surgical technique, though vigilance for later AUS mechanical failure is warranted.This study represents one of the largest single-institution series evaluating IPP after TC-AUS and includes detailed operative and follow-up data. However, its retrospective design, small cohort size, and limited follow-up duration restrict generalizability.IPP placement after TC-AUS appears safe, with low infection and erosion rates, though AUS cuff leaks may occur more frequently than when either device is implanted alone.© The Author(s) 2026.

41498526,2026-01-08,Functional and transcriptional senescence profiles of CD8+ T cells associate with the presence of carotid plaques in people living with HIV.,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the immunological mechanisms driving plaque formation remain unclear. This study investigated the association between peripheral immune cell subsets and carotid atherosclerotic plaques in PLHIV without prior clinical ASCVD.In this multi-center cross-sectional study, virally suppressed PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy were enrolled from two Dutch cohorts: a discovery cohort (n= 994) and a validation cohort (n= 200). Between November 2019 and October 2021, participants underwent carotid ultrasound imaging to assess plaques using standardized criteria. Immune profiling was performed using high-dimensional flow cytometry of 355 immune cell populations. Associations with plaque were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for relevant confounders, and key findings were validated in the second cohort. Transcriptomic profiles of main cell populations were evaluated using deconvoluted bulk RNA sequencing to identify differential expression and pathway enrichment.Carotid plaques were present in 584 participants (49%) - 502 of 994 (51%) in the discovery and 82 of 200 (41%) in the validation cohort. Plaques were associated with higher counts of several CD8+ T cell subsets, particularly PD-1-expressing cytotoxic T cells with an interferon secretion profile (CD8TC1PD1+). Transcriptomic analysis of CD8+ T cells revealed downregulated mitochondrial function and upregulated type 1 interferon and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, indicating a senescent phenotype.CD8+ T cell senescence may contribute to early atherosclerotic plaque formation in PLHIV.

41498716,2026-01-08,Emerging Diagnostic Indications for Endoscopic Ultrasound.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a diagnostic imaging tool into a versatile platform that enables high-precision access, sampling, and therapy across gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases. This review summarizes recent advances that are reshaping diagnostic practice and theragnostics. In chronic pancreatitis, EUS remains central when cross-sectional imaging is equivocal; secretin-stimulated endoscopic pancreatic function testing can complement morphology, although discordant results limit standalone certainty. For pancreatic cancer, secretin-stimulated duodenal pancreatic-juice collection enables ""liquid biopsy"" analyses-including methylated DNA markers and extracellular-vesicle microRNAs-that augment carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and may enhance early detection and cyst surveillance. In endohepatology, EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement and liver biopsy offer accurate, same-session assessment with strong safety profiles. Adjunctive imaging-contrast-enhanced EUS and elastography-improves lesion characterization and targeting. Tissue acquisition has shifted toward end-cutting fine-needle biopsy needles, optimized by fanning/torque techniques, wet-suction, and macroscopic/visual on-site evaluation, reducing passes while preserving molecular adequacy. Artificial intelligence is emerging across workflows-from differentiating pancreatic lesions and staging to automating standardized photodocumentation and reporting-and is being explored for needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy image interpretation. For pancreatic cysts, glucose, selected genomics (eg, KRAS/GNAS and targeted panels), and through-the-needle biopsy refine diagnosis. Finally, EUS-obtained tissue now seeds organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and organotypic slice cultures to test individualized therapies. Collectively, these innovations move EUS beyond ""see and biopsy"" toward detect, predict, and personalize.Copyright © 2025 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For pancreatitis, EUS can provide important information when other imaging tests are unclear. EUS can also collect pancreatic fluid samples, which can be analyzed for biomarkers that may help detect pancreatic cancer earlier. In liver disease, EUS can measure pressure in blood vessels and obtain liver tissue samples, providing valuable data in a single procedure. The researchers also highlight how new technologies like artificial intelligence, specialized biopsy needles, and 3D tissue cultures are enhancing EUS's capabilities to characterize lesions, guide treatment",Gastroenterology,Radiology

This research paper examines a rare type of skin cancer called mycosis fungoides, which is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The researchers looked at cases where this cancer undergoes a transformation, becoming more aggressive with larger cancer cells that express a protein called CD30. Understanding this aggressive subtype of mycosis fungoides is important, as it can be challenging to diagnose and treat effectively. 

The researchers reviewed medical records to identify patients with mycosis fungoides who had this large-cell transformation and CD30 positivity. They analyzed the clinical features, treatment approaches, and outcomes for these patients. The key finding was that this aggressive subtype was associated with a poorer prognosis compared to typical mycosis fungoides, with many patients requiring intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. However, some patients did respond well to targeted therapies that block the CD30 protein.

Rectal NSAIDs are guideline-recommended for PEP prophylaxis, yet direct evidence comparing different NSAIDs remains scarce. This study systematically evaluates head-to-head evidence to compare the efficacy of rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin in the prevention of PEP.This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251107055). Eligible studies directly compared rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for PEP prevention in adults undergoing ERCP. A comprehensive search of five databases was performed through July 2025. Pooled risk ratios with 95% CIs were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models based on heterogeneity, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Four studies (three RCTs, one observational; n = 2,917) compared rectal diclofenac (n = 1,275) and indomethacin (n = 1,642) for PEP prevention. Baseline characteristics were comparable, except for less frequent balloon dilatation with diclofenac (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89; p < 0.001). No significant differences were found for overall PEP (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92-1.49; I2 = 0%), mild PEP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94-1.63; I2 = 0%), moderate PEP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.21-1.73; I2 = 0%), severe PEP (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.32-3.77; I2 = 1%), or moderate-to-severe PEP (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46-2.05; I2 = 0%). Secondary outcomes, including mortality and complications, were also similar, with low heterogeneity, indicating equivalent efficacy and safety.Diclofenac and indomethacin demonstrate equivalent efficacy and safety, allowing cost and availability to inform the choice of PEP prophylaxis.© 2026.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded the Alliance reference set study to assess MCDs for use in future trials.Individuals with cancer and controls were recruited; blood specimens were collected prior to cancer treatment. A performance evaluation study was designed utilizing reference set samples. Companies (n = 6) were selected to participate based on review of performance data and ability to utilize the blood collection tube. Companies received samples from cancer types their assay was designed to detect (""targeted""), plus additional ""non-targeted"" and control samples. Companies reported positive/negative calls, risk scores, and tissue-of-origin (TOO) predictions. Sensitivity was computed for early (I-II) and late (III-IV) stage cases, based on positive/negative calls (SEPN) and at fixed 98% specificity (SE98). Specificity and TOO accuracy were computed.549 cases (encompassing 13 cancer types) and 413 controls from the reference set were included in the study. Companies assessed samples from median 6 (range 5-9) targeted cancer types and median 8 (range: 7-11) overall cancer types. Median (range) specificity was 92.3% (76.5%-98.5%). Median (range) SEPN was 32% (25%-42%) for early stage 73% (48%-89%) for late stage; while median (range) SE98 was 19% (8%-35%) for early stage and 66% (13%-79%) for late stage. Median sensitivity for non-targeted types was 40% (early stage) and 52% (late stage).

40873195,2026-01-08,Recent-onset atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly diagnosed early, close to its first occurrence due to: (i) increased public awareness with self-screening; (ii) health care initiatives including population screening and opportunistic case finding; and (iii) increased use and surveillance of implantable cardiac devices. At its onset, AF is often low burden, and cardiovascular co-morbidities may be absent or at an early stage. Thus, the management of recent-onset AF has become an issue of growing importance. Professional guidelines have traditionally focused on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, generally recommending a cautious approach to rhythm control, and priority has been given to rate control to alleviate symptoms. In recent guidelines, the importance of managing lifestyle and co-morbidities has increased. The AF-SCREEN collaboration proposes that a vigorous approach to active management of recent-onset AF may be warranted. This includes addressing co-morbidities and promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent the emergence or progression of AF and associated cardiovascular disease, as well as the initiation of active rhythm control ± anticoagulation to prevent AF-related morbidity and mortality, including stroke and heart failure (HF). Intuitively, intervention early after AF onset would be beneficial since lifestyle and co-morbidity management, plus rhythm control and anticoagulation, are important contributors to improved outcomes in patients with established AF, but robust evidence is lacking for recent-onset AF. There is a delicate balance between achieving favourable outcomes such as preventing strokes, HF and AF progression vs the complications and potential adverse effects of interventions. Given the serious long-term consequences, innovative approaches are necessary to determine the value and risks of initiating active therapy very early in the course of AF. More data are needed to guide the best management of recent-onset AF, bearing AF burden in mind. Long-term studies using large national databases linked to electronic medical records and rhythm monitoring devices offer excellent opportunities. Shorter-term studies focusing on reducing AF burden to slow AF progression and studies focusing on outcomes such as HF could be used in both randomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies.© The Author(s) 2025.

Here, we identified two potent, neutralizing single domain antibodies directed against the tetrameric receptor binding (H) protein of CDV. Structural analyses spotlighted two vulnerable sites within the H protein. While the first overlaps with the receptor binding site, the second encompasses amino acid residues of two protomers located at the distal dimeric head interface, which supports distinct mechanisms of neutralization. Upon application of an engineered tetravalent and biparatopic antibody, ferrets were protected at a remarkably low antibody dose (1 mg/kg) administered intra-peritoneally on days 3 and 7 post-exposure of a lethal CDV challenge.

The Importance of Clinical Specificity and Challenges of Diagnostic Evolution in Progressive Speech-Language Disorders.,"This viewpoint addresses the complexity of the nomenclature of progressive speech-language disorders, which often exists at the intersection of descriptive symptoms, clinical syndromes, and underlying neuropathology. Using primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) as an example, we explore how overlapping diagnostic frameworks employed by speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other clinicians and researchers can lead to different diagnostic labels that may evolve throughout disease progression. These discrepancies and changes can complicate patient understanding, clinical care, and affect eligibility for clinical trials. We highlight the importance of diagnostic specificity, flexibility, and multidisciplinary collaboration in improving patient counseling, prognostication, treatment planning, and clinical research alignment, particularly in the context of the growing number of clinical trials and specialized, multidisciplinary clinics.This viewpoint explores how symptom-based, syndrome-based, and pathology-based diagnoses can work together to support patient care and research. Accurate and specific diagnosis of speech-language disorders has important implications for patient understanding of their condition, identity, prognostic accuracy, access to care, clinical trial enrollment, and treatment planning and efficacy. Misdiagnosis or vague labeling can result in inappropriate interventions, delayed support, and skewed research findings. We argue that multidisciplinary collaboration and flexibility in recognizing evolving symptom-based and syndrome-based labels over the disease course-and as the fields learn more-is essential to empower patients with accurate, actionable information.

41499701,2026-01-08,Probable Stricturing in Small Bowel Crohn Disease: In Support of SAR Consensus Recommendations.,"Crohn disease is a chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder affecting nearly one million people in the United States. Despite therapeutic advances, many patients do not achieve durable intestinal healing, and stricture-related complications, including internal penetrating disease, remain frequent. Disease often progresses radiologically from isolated active inflammation (characterized by bowel wall thickening), to associated luminal narrowing (i.e., >50% diameter reduction), to associated upstream dilatation (i.e., overt stricture, with obstruction risk). The intermediate stage of wall thickening with luminal narrowing is associated with distinct biomarker profiles, microbial signatures, gene expression patterns, imaging features, and prognostic outcomes. Accordingly, consensus statements from the Society of Abdominal Radiology Inflammatory Bowel Disease Disease-Focus Panel indicate that patients with bowel wall thickening and fixed luminal narrowing without upstream dilation should be considered to have probable strictures. Yet, current clinical classification systems do not fully incorporate this radiologic entity. For example, the Montreal and Paris classifications have historically classified patients with wall thickening and luminal narrowing as having the inflammatory rather than stricturing phenotype. This Perspective summarizes evidence supporting probable strictures as a distinct biologic and clinical entity that could aid individualized care and argues for integrating probable stricturing into radiology reports, clinical classification schemes, and treatment pathways.",AJR.

Moreover, the typically prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) correlates inconsistently with overall survival (OS), underscoring the importance of examining other surrogates. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24), an established early endpoint, delineates functionally high-risk patients in other indolent lymphomas. This international study evaluated 253 patients receiving frontline fixed-duration bendamustine-rituximab (BR), a common chemoimmunotherapy for WM. At median follow-up of 5.9 years, 5-year PFS and OS were 65% and 87%, respectively; 5-year PFS was similar between MYD88L265P (90%) and MYD88wild-type (WT) subcohorts (64% each, p=0.4). Among 89 patients with known CXCR4 status, the subcohort with CXCR4mutation (28%) had shorter PFS (median, 3.3 versus 8.8 years; HR 2.8, p=0.0036) and OS (HR 2.6, p=0.036) compared to CXCR4WT. POD24 occurred in 11.5% of patients who demonstrated inferior subsequent OS (5-year OS: 71% versus 86%; HR 3.1, p=0.005) and higher mortality (SMR 3.7), unlike the non-POD24 group, whose mortality was comparable to the matched general population (SMR 1.1). In conclusion, BR is effective, irrespective of the MYD88 status, but CXCR4 mutations and POD24 portend worse outcomes. Non-POD24 patients represent a cohort with distinctly favorable outcome.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Jan 07, 2026",2026.0,Jan,7.0,Saurabh Zanwar|Jithma P Abeykoon|Shirley D'Sa|Damien Roos-Weil|Dirk R Larson|Colin L Colby|Eric Durot|Efstathios Kastritis|Encarl Uppal|Oliver Tomkins|Pierre Morel|Patrizia Mondello|Lydia Montes|Jonas Paludo|Sikander Ailawadhi|Shayna Sarosiek|Olabisi Ogunbiyi|Pascalle Cornillet-Lefebvre|S V Rajkumar|Anne Quinquenel|Angela Dispenzieri|Rafael Fonseca|Morie A Gertz|Shaji K Kumar|Meletios A Dimopoulos|Stephen M Ansell|Steven P Treon|Jorge J Castillo|Prashant Kapoor,Saurabh Zanwar|Jithma P Abeykoon|Dirk R Larson|Colin L Colby|Patrizia Mondello|Jonas Paludo|Sikander Ailawadhi|S V Rajkumar|Angela Dispenzieri|Rafael Fonseca|Morie A Gertz|Shaji K Kumar|Stephen M Ansell|Prashant Kapoor,"Mayo Clinic, rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|UCLH Centre for Waldenströms Macroglobulinaemia and Related Conditions, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Pitié-Salpêtrière, paris, France.|Hôpital Robert Debré CHU de Reims, Reims cedex, France.|Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.|University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Tryst, London, United Kingdom.|CHU Amiens Picardie, Amiens, France.|CHU Amiens, Amiens, France.|Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, United States.|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|UCLH Center for Waldenstroms, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.|Hopital Robert debré, Reims, France.|Hopital Robert Debré, CHU Reims, Reims, France.|Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States.|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.","Saurabh Zanwar, Jithma P Abeykoon, Shirley D'Sa, Damien Roos-Weil, Dirk R Larson, Colin L Colby, Eric Durot, Efstathios Kastritis, Encarl Uppal, Oliver Tomkins, Pierre Morel, Patrizia Mondello, Lydia Montes, Jonas Paludo, Sikander Ailawadhi, Shayna Sarosiek, Olabisi Ogunbiyi, Pascalle Cornillet-Lefebvre, S V Rajkumar, Anne Quinquenel, Angela Dispenzieri, Rafael Fonseca, Morie A Gertz, Shaji K Kumar, Meletios A Dimopoulos, Stephen M Ansell, Steven P Treon, Jorge J Castillo, Prashant Kapoor",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41499755/,"This research examines a new way to predict outcomes for patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, a rare type of blood cancer.

Unlike with TP53 mutations, where mechanisms of progression are defined, pathways underlying clonal fitness and transformation in PPM1D mutant cells remain unclear. In collaboration with 5 academic institutions, we analyzed the clinical and molecular landscape of 337 patients with clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) across four genotypes: PPM1Dmt/TP53wt (n= 170 [50%]), PPM1Dmt/TP53mt (n= 25 [7%]), TP53mt/PPM1Dwt (n=17 [5%]), and TP53wt/PPM1Dwt (n= 125 [38%]). All PPM1D variants were truncating, located in exon 6 of the gene, with a median variant allele frequency (VAF) of 6% (0.3-64%). The PPM1Dmt/TP53mt genotype was most frequently encountered in therapy related (t)CH/CCUS (80%, 66.5%, 76.5% and 19%; p= <0.001) and had a shorter time interval to detection from last genotoxic exposure (6.2, 5.9, 11.25, and 24.5 months; p= <0.001), in comparison to PPM1Dmt/TP53wt, TP53mt/PPM1Dwt and TP53wt/PPM1Dwt genotypes, respectively.

We investigated oxidative stress and hypoxia pathways in term placentae from Alaska Native women who did (commercial or iqmik; n=10) or did not (n=18) use ST during pregnancy. Despite substantial maternal exposure to nicotine, placentae of women who used ST had similar mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and markers of hypoxia compared to those who did not use tobacco. Although mRNA levels of angiogenesis markers vegf and vegfr2 were similar between groups, vegfr1 mRNA levels are increased in placentae of women using ST compared to women who did not use tobacco.

Biological age may better capture ageing's impact on MS and might accelerate due to MS itself. Establishing accelerated biological ageing in adults is complicated by normal ageing and comorbidities. Telomere length, a well-recognised biological ageing marker, is shortened in adults with MS and associated with disability. Demonstrating accelerated biological ageing in paediatric-onset MS (POMS) would strengthen the hypothesis that MS drives premature biological ageing. This study aimed to determine if telomere length differs in POMS compared to age-similar healthy controls.We performed a cross-sectional case-control study of whole blood samples and clinical data from The US Network of Pediatric MS Centers. Real-time quantitative PCR measured telomere length, expressed as a telomere to somatic DNA ratio (T/S ratio). T/S ratio was compared between cases and age-similar healthy controls using multivariate regression analysis adjusting for chronological age, sex, race, ethnicity, tobacco exposure, socioeconomic status and body mass index.We analysed 300 POMS cases and 200 controls. The unadjusted mean T/S ratios were 1.66 (SD 0.32) for cases and 1.71 (SD 0.29) for controls (mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.01, p=0.08). After adjusting for key covariables with face validity, POMS participants had a mean 0.086 shorter T/S ratio than controls (95% CI 0.015 to 0.157, p=0.018).POMS participants demonstrated shorter telomeres than age-similar controls in a multivariable model adjusting for sociodemographic variables, suggesting that MS may contribute to accelerated biological ageing.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

A significant issue hindering GBM therapeutic development is intratumor heterogeneity and plasticity. GBM tumors contain neoplastic cells within a fluid spectrum of diverse transcriptional states. Identifying effective therapeutics requires a platform that predicts the differential sensitivity and resistance of these states to various treatments. Here, we develop scFOCAL (Single-Cell Framework for -Omics Connectivity and Analysis via L1000), to quantify the cellular drug sensitivity and resistance landscape. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM tumors, we identify compounds from the LINCS L1000 database with transcriptional response signatures selectively discordant with distinct GBM cell states, and leverage this capability to predict combination synergy. We validate the significance of these findings in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and identify a combination of an OLIG2 inhibitor and Depatux-M for the treatment of GBM. Our studies suggest that scFOCAL identifies cell states that are sensitive and resistant to targeted therapies in GBM using a measure of cell and drug connectivity, which can be applied to identify new synergistic combinations.© 2025.

41499543,2026-01-08,Unbiased inference for echocardiogram urgency prediction using double machine learning.,"The increased utilization of echocardiography in clinical practice has witnessed a substantial rise, underscoring its pivotal role as a diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular conditions. However, due to the relative scarcity of echocardiography tests, challenges persist in efficiently prioritizing patients for echocardiographic assessments. In this study, we develop a model to assess the urgency of appointments by considering both clinical and administrative variables extracted from Electronic Health Record data. We use double machine learning techniques to analyze these variables and improve our predictions of patient urgency. Traditional methods for estimating variable effects have limitations, particularly in our research context, where clinical and administrative variables may influence one another while also directly impacting the outcome (i.e., the urgency of appointments). In this work, we address this issue by developing an urgency stratification model using double machine learning, which disentangles the complex relationships between variables. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms traditional machine learning methods in predicting appointment urgency but also provides robust estimations of variable effects. Specifically, our results underscore the critical roles of administrative variables and cancer-related comorbidity variables in patient prioritization and appointment urgency prediction. By leveraging double machine learning techniques, our method can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of echocardiography utilization in clinical practice. It provides clinicians with actionable insights for patient prioritization, facilitating the timely identification of urgent cases and the optimal allocation of resources. Our work contributes to the advancement of healthcare practices by leveraging sophisticated analytics to improve patient care delivery and streamline clinical workflows in echocardiography laboratories.

Participants obtain their assigned medication through their health insurance and complete semi-annual study assessments.We engaged multiple partners to develop a centralized text message-based program to facilitate adherence and retention in PRECIDENTD and evaluated its performance from April 2024 to April 2025.The PRECIDENTD study team applied best practices in digital health tool design and built the program with technology company MEMOTEXT. Patient partners identified program goals, co-wrote message content, and completed internal testing. We then deployed the program to PRECIDENTD participants and analyzed responses.We assessed response rate to interactive text messages, proportion of messages flagging participants needing additional support, and the adherence problems identified.The text messaging program includes interactive messages querying if participants are taking the study medication, as well as one-way study timeline messages. During the first year, 450 PRECIDENTD participants across 20 sites received texts. Interactive message response rate was 80%, and 25% of responses identified problems (ie, trouble getting fills/refills and experiencing a health concern or side effect), prompting an outreach call.We co-designed a digital tool that engaged participants and helped identify study participants needing assistance obtaining and adhering to study medications. Collaborative development of similar centralized tools may augment the capacity of national studies to answer important comparative effectiveness research questions.Copyright © 2026 The Author(s).

PCORnet® Studies can also include institutions that do not participate in PCORnet, and for these organizations, the cost of instantiating a PCORnet® CDM can be prohibitive. Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (FHIR) provides an alternative method of obtaining EHR data.To determine whether data obtained through FHIR might be a viable study solution for those sites that do not participate in PCORnet.® This mixed-methods project had 2 objectives: (1) survey sites participating in PCORnet on the availability of FHIR (FHIR survey); (2) compare the coverage of a FHIR-based data extract using REDCap with one from the PCORnet® CDM across 3 sites (FHIR extract).(1) FHIR survey: A series of questions were asked about the use of FHIR in a production capacity.

Our goal for this study was to develop a pancreas-liver co-culture system suited for mechanistic and therapy testing studies in the context of multi-organ cross talk. To achieve this goal, we developed a co-axial flow-focusing microfluidic device to fabricate multi-compartment hydrogel microcapsules. Each microcapsule contained two aqueous compartments or cores surrounded by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. Each microcapsule had pancreatic β-cells loaded into one compartment and hepatic cells into another compartment. Individual encapsulated cells assembled into pancreatic and hepatic cell spheroids over time. Characterization of microcapsules revealed enhanced hepatic and pancreatic function in microcapsules containing pancreas-liver co-cultures compared to microcapsules with one cell type only. Multicompartment microcapsules represent a novel microphysiological system type and hold the promise of increasing experiment throughput for mechanism discovery and drug development studies.© 2026.

41289012,2026-01-09,Daily locomotor activity declines with tumor growth and disease progression in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor that often progresses despite resection and treatment. Timely and continuous assessment of GBM progression is critical to expedite secondary surgery or enrollment in clinical trials. However, current progression detection requires costly and specialized MRI examinations, which, in the absence of new symptoms or signs, are usually scheduled every 2-3 months. Here, we hypothesized that changes in daily activity are associated with GBM growth and disease progression. We found that wheel-running activity in GBM-bearing mice declined as tumors grew and preceded weight loss and circadian breakdown by over a week. Temozolomide treatment in the morning, but not evening, significantly reduced tumor size and restored daily locomotion in mice. In a pilot study of 6 patients with GBM wearing an actigraphy watch, wrist movement provided a feasible and continuous longitudinal indicator of daily activity with 1-minute resolution. After tumor resection and radiation, daily activity declined in 2 patients 19 and 55 days before detection of progression by MRI but did not change for the 4 patients with stable disease. These results suggest that daily activity tracking using wearable devices may serve as a real-time indicator and potential monitoring tool for GBM progression and treatment efficacy.",JCI insight,"Jan 09, 2026",2026.0,Jan,9.0,Maria F Gonzalez-Aponte|Sofia V Salvatore|Anna R Damato|Ruth G Katumba|Grayson R Talcott|Omar H Butt|Jian L Campian|Jingqin Luo|Joshua B Rubin|Olivia J Walch|Erik D Herzog,Jian L Campian,"Department of Biology, Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery.|Siteman Cancer Center Biostatistics and Qualitative Research Shared Resource.|Department of Pediatrics, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and.|Department of Neuroscience, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.|Arcascope Inc., Arlington, Virginia, USA.|Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.","Maria F Gonzalez-Aponte, Sofia V Salvatore, Anna R Damato, Ruth G Katumba, Grayson R Talcott, Omar H Butt, Jian L Campian, Jingqin Luo, Joshua B Rubin, Olivia J Walch, Erik D Herzog",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41289012/,"Glioblastoma is an aggressive and deadly type of brain cancer that often continues to grow despite treatment.

The initial studies describing this technique used a relatively smooth Br56 kernel. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that the use of the sharpest quantitative kernel on photon-counting CT (Qr89), particularly when denoised with techniques such as quantum iterative reconstruction or convolutional neural networks, enhances the detection of CSF-venous fistulas. In this clinical report, we sought to determine whether the Qr89 kernel has utility in patients with dural tears, the other main type of spinal CSF leak. We performed a retrospective review of patients with dural tears diagnosed on photon-counting CT myelography, comparing Br56, Qr89 denoised with quantum iterative reconstruction, and Qr89 denoised with a trained convolutional neural network. We specifically assessed spatial resolution, noise level, and diagnostic confidence in 8 such cases, finding that the sharper Qr89 kernel outperformed the smoother Br56 kernel. This finding was particularly true when Qr89 was denoised using a convolutional neural network. Furthermore, in 2 cases, the dural tear was only seen on the Qr89 reconstructions and missed on the Br56 kernel. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential value of further optimizing postprocessing techniques for photon-counting CT myelography aimed at localizing dural tears.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

High-quality studies in this population are lacking, with limited data on medications approved to treat IBD during pregnancy. For patients, limited knowledge surrounding pregnancy impacts pregnancy rates, medication adherence, and outcomes. Limited provider knowledge leads to highly varied practices in care affected by local dogma, available resources, individual interpretation of the literature, and fear of harming the fetus. The variations in guidelines by different societies and countries reflect this and lead to confusion for physicians and patients alike. The Global Consensus Consortium is a group of 39 IBD and content experts and 7 patient advocates from 6 continents who convened to review and assess current data and come to an agreement on best practices based on these data.The GRADE process was used when sufficient published data were available and the RAND process in those instances where expert opinion was needed to guide consistent practice. Recommendations were informed by the guiding principle that maternal health best supports infant health.The topics were divided into ten categories with 34 GRADE recommendations and 35 Consensus statements.Overall, the goal of the group was to provide data-driven and practical guidance to improve the care of women with IBD around the globe based on the best available research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

In contrast, carotid involvement and complete occlusions were more frequent in patients with CeADed (p < 0.001 for both). CeADid was associated with a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) toward worse functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-0.92) but the odds for favorable outcomes (mRS = 0-2) did not differ between the groups after appropriate adjustments on multivariate analysis. CeADid was independently associated with higher mortality at 180 days on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.50-5.38).CeADid is associated with more severe clinical presentation, a shift toward less favorable outcomes, and higher mortality rates. These findings suggest that CeADid may represent a high-risk type of CeAD.

41504430,2026-01-09,Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line IV Versus Oral Iron for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding.,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects nearly one-third of women globally, with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) being a significant risk factor among those of reproductive age. Despite the substantial burden of HMB-related IDA, patients often face delays in receiving effective treatment. Oral iron is typically used as first-line therapy, despite frequent gastrointestinal side effects and challenges in treatment adherence. This study evaluated the reproductive lifespan cost-effectiveness of first-line intravenous (IV) versus oral iron therapy for women with HMB and IDA. We developed a Markov model simulating a cohort of women from age 18 to 51, comparing first-line treatment with IV iron dextran, IV ferumoxytol, IV iron sucrose, or oral ferrous sulfate. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from the societal perspective. IV iron dextran was the cost-effective treatment, yielding 19.26 QALYs at a cost of $157,500, compared with 19.10 QALYs at $152,900 for oral ferrous sulfate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for IV iron dextran was $28,600 per QALY. Treatment with IV ferumoxytol and iron sucrose cost $158,300 and $163,500 respectively and did not provide additional QALY benefit compared with IV iron dextran, which remained the cost-effective treatment across a range of scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Our findings indicate that first-line treatment with IV iron dextran is the cost-effective strategy for managing IDA in women with HMB at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. These results support expanding access to IV iron as a first-line option and highlight the need to reduce treatment delays and insurance-related barriers.Copyright © 2026 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Jan 08, 2026",2026.0,Jan,8.0,Daniel Wang|Manraj S Sra|Satoko Ito|Ding Q Ng|Samira Glaeser-Khan|Daniel Y Wang|Sam Hirniak|Alfred I Lee|Adam Cuker|George Goshua,Manraj S Sra,"Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut, United States.|University Of Waterloo, Kitchener, Ontario, Ontario, Canada.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.","Daniel Wang, Manraj S Sra, Satoko Ito, Ding Q Ng, Samira Glaeser-Khan, Daniel Y Wang, Sam Hirniak, Alfred I Lee, Adam Cuker, George Goshua",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41504430/,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common problem, especially for women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

41504793,2026-01-09,Molecular and genetic insights into vestibular schwannoma.,"Vestibular Schwannomas (VS) are benign nerve sheath tumors arising from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve, occurring sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Clinical management of VS is challenging due to the tumor's location adjacent to critical neural and vascular structures. The primary morbidities are hearing loss and facial nerve dysfunction, which significantly affect quality of life. There are no FDA-approved medical therapies, and treatment typically consists of surgery or radiation, with treatment decisions centered on optimizing hearing and facial nerve preservation.This review synthesizes recent advances in the molecular characterization of VS.The loss of NF2 function, leading to Merlin inactivation, is a key driver of VS tumorigenesis, disrupting multiple growth and survival pathways. Beyond NF2 inactivation, emerging genomic studies have revealed additional molecular alterations, including chromatin remodeling defects and oncogenic gene fusions, broadening our understanding of VS heterogeneity. Recent single-cell and multi-omic studies have uncovered distinct tumor subtypes and highlighted the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the interaction between Schwann cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).These findings have important implications for therapeutic development, as they suggest differential treatment strategies based on molecular and immune profiles. While surgery and radiotherapy remain the standard of care, targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and immunotherapies are being investigated to improve patient outcomes.© 2026.

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) previously provided consensus recommendations on the approach to endoscopy in EoE across topics of endoscopic diagnosis, endoscopic grading, and esophageal dilation. Because additional areas of endoscopy still required guidance, we performed an independent modified Delphi process focusing on pediatric considerations, disease assessment, and disease monitoring. A core group of EoE experts reviewed published guidelines and developed a set of patient-centered recommendation statements informed by literature review. A multidisciplinary group of adult and pediatric international EoE experts then voted on the statements over 2 Delphi rounds. All statements with 80% agreement were accepted for inclusion. This process yielded 28 consensus statements. Pediatric-specific statements covered when to suspect EoE and perform endoscopy, how to grade endoscopic severity, and when and how to perform esophageal dilation in children. Statements across all age ranges addressed the role of less-invasive monitoring, performing diagnostic endoscopy off treatment, the need to consider symptoms, endoscopic features, and histologic findings when assessing disease activity, treatment-based monitoring intervals, and the approach to esophageal biopsies during monitoring. Coupled with the original consensus work, we provide a comprehensive endoscopic approach to EoE as well as practical guidance for procedure-related aspects in the field to facilitate high-quality endoscopic care to patients with EoE.Copyright © 2025 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

41505889,2026-01-09,Exploiting harmonic signature of gas vesicles in amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition for ultrafast ultrasound molecular imaging.,"Ultrafast nonlinear ultrasound imaging of gas vesicles (GVs) promises high-sensitivity biomolecular visualization for applications such as targeted molecular imaging and real-time tracking of gene expression. However, separating GV-specific signals from tissue background remains challenging due to tissue clutter and limitations of current methods, which require complex transmit schemes and suffer from incomplete tissue suppression. This study aims to develop and validate harmonic amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (HAM-SVD), a novel technique that represents a shift from current GV imaging methods by exploiting the unique nonlinear pressure-dependence of the GV harmonic signature.&#xD;Approach: HAM-SVD employs single-cycle plane waves transmitted at 9.6 MHz across five tilted angles at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 Hz, under four duty cycles with alternating polarity. Beamformed data are reshaped into a space-pressure Casorati matrix and decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD). Tissue background is suppressed by discarding the first (weakly nonlinear tissue) and lowest (noise) singular modes, yielding images comprised solely of pressure-dependent second-harmonic GV signals. The method was validated through numerical simulations, in vitro phantom experiments, and in vivo rat lower limb imaging.&#xD;Main results: HAM-SVD achieved a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 19.16 ± 1.63 dB in vivo, significantly outperforming pulse inversion (14.19 ± 1.41 dB) and AM-SVD (15.79 ± 1.38 dB). Simulation and phantom studies demonstrated superior spatial coherence in singular vector decomposition and reduced nonlinear artifacts compared to AM-SVD. HAM-SVD enables wide-field, ultrafast imaging without complex transmit sequences while maintaining robust tissue clutter suppression across varying pressure levels.&#xD;Significance: By combining harmonic imaging with AM-SVD's adaptive clutter filtering, HAM-SVD overcomes limitations of conventional nonlinear techniques, including depth restrictions and incomplete tissue cancellation. This approach enhances molecular imaging specificity for GVs and holds translational potential for ultrasound localization microscopy of slow-flowing contrast agents and preclinical disease-targeted molecular imaging.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Physics in medicine and biology,"Jan 08, 2026",2026.0,Jan,8.0,Ge Zhang|Henri Leroy|Nabil Haidour|Nicolas Zucker|Deyver E Rivera|Anatole Jimenez|Thomas Deffieux|Dina Malounda|Rohit Nayak|Sophie Pezet|Mathieu Pernot|Mikhail G Shapiro|Mickael Tanter,Rohit Nayak,"Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, Centre, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, Centre, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, 75015, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, Paris, 75231, FRANCE.|Physics for Medicine Paris, Physics for Medicine Paris, INSERM U1273, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, CNRS, 2-10 rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, Paris, 75231, FRANCE.|Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Pasadena, 91125, UNITED STATES.|Radiology, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905-0002, UNITED STATES.|Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS, INSERM, 1 rue Jussieu, Paris, Paris, 75005, FRANCE.|California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Pasadena, California, 91125-0002, UNITED STATES.|Lab Ondes et Acoustique, Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris, Ville de Paris, Universite Paris VII Denis Diderot ESPCI, 10 rue Vauquelin 75005 Paris, Paris, 75015, FRANCE.","Ge Zhang, Henri Leroy, Nabil Haidour, Nicolas Zucker, Deyver E Rivera, Anatole Jimenez, Thomas Deffieux, Dina Malounda, Rohit Nayak, Sophie Pezet, Mathieu Pernot, Mikhail G Shapiro, Mickael Tanter",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41505889/,"This research explores a new technique called harmonic amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (HAM-SVD) that can improve the imaging of gas-filled structures called gas vesicles (GVs) using ultrasound.

Furthermore, this limited education often contains commonly held myths about facial pain diagnosis. These myths can result in misdiagnoses that lead to ineffective medications, interventions, or surgeries and prolonged pain. Therefore, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Headache and Facial Pain Special Interest Group convened a multidisciplinary group of neurologists, anesthesiologists, and dentists to identify and dispel pervasive myths in facial pain diagnosis.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2026.

41506846,2026-01-09,Multiplanar Reformatted Imaging of the Temporal Bone.,"Multiplanar reformatted imaging is a useful technique in cross-sectional imaging. Multiplanar reformatted imaging allows for the creation of images in planes that are oblique to the original volumetric data. Use of this tool is particularly important in the temporal bone, an anatomically complex structure that is composed of minute osseous landmarks, foramina, clefts, and aqueducts. For example, multiplanar reformatted imaging can be used to assess the integrity and alignment of the ossicles, highlight various pathologic entities, and evaluate the morphology of the inner ear structures.

41507603,2026-01-09,Redox-driven ADAR1 activation promotes Okazaki fragment maturation and DNA replication integrity.,"Okazaki fragment maturation requires efficient removal of RNA primers to form a continuous lagging strand, yet how mismatched primers introduced by error-prone primase are corrected remains unresolved. Here, we show that physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiate a redox-dependent mechanism that drives ADAR1-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing. Oxidation triggers ADAR1 dimerization at replication forks, enhancing RNA editing of mismatched primers-particularly those caused by ATP misincorporation on d(T+C)-rich centromeric DNA. This A-to-I editing step facilitates more efficient RNA primer degradation by RNase H2, thereby ensuring proper Okazaki fragment maturation. Disruption of ADAR1 oxidation results in increased unligated Okazaki fragments, single-stranded gaps and double-strand breaks, most prominently at centromeres. These findings reveal a role for ROS in safeguarding lagging-strand synthesis by coupling ADAR1 oxidation-induced A-to-I RNA editing to replication fork stability.© 2026.

41507664,2026-01-09,A catecholamine-independent pathway controlling adaptive adipocyte lipolysis.,"Several adipose depots, including constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue, resist conventional lipolytic cues. However, under starvation, wasting or cachexia, the body eventually catabolizes stable adipocytes through unknown mechanisms. Here we developed a mouse model of brain-evoked depletion of all fat, including stable constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue, independent of food intake, to study this phenomenon. Genetic, surgical and chemical approaches demonstrated that catabolism of stable adipocytes required adipose triglyceride lipase-dependent lipolysis but was independent of local nerves, the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamines. Instead, concurrent hypoglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia activated a potent catabolic state by suppressing lipid storage and increasing catecholamine-independent lipolysis via downregulation of cell-autonomous lipolytic inhibitors including G0s2. This was also sufficient to delipidate classical adipose depots and was recapitulated in tumour-associated cachexic mice. Overall, this defines unique adaptations of stable adipocytes to resist lipolysis in healthy states while isolating a potent catecholamine-independent neurosystemic pathway by which the body can rapidly catabolize all adipose tissues.© 2026.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on management. This practice advisory aims to fill this critical gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature and providing comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for managing headache patients during hospitalization.In February 2023, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine approved this practice advisory proposal. The steering committee selected committee members based on clinical and research expertise in the field of headache medicine. Nine questions were formulated by the committee, and each question was assigned to a group composed of 3-4 members. A systematic literature search for each question was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science on June 21, 2023. The results from each search were imported into separate Covidence projects for screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Additionally, relevant systematic reviews (SR) were screened. Each group submitted a structured narrative review along with statements and recommendations based on the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) format for grading of evidence. While the USPSTF framework was used, including the language in the recommendations, the formal USPSTF methodology, including the SR with meta-analysis and summary tables with forest plots, was not followed because of low overall evidence quality. The interim draft was shared electronically with each collaborator, who was requested to vote anonymously using two rounds of the modified Delphi approach. A consensus recommendation required >75% agreement.The panel generated 12 statements and 17 recommendations, along with their strength and certainty of evidence. Following two rounds of Delphi voting, a high consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations. Most statements received a low-to-moderate level of certainty, and all but one recommendation received grade B or C, which was consistent with the lack of randomized controlled trials supporting most of the drugs in this document.This evidence-based practice advisory provides a foundational step toward standardizing inpatient headache care and highlights existing gaps in the literature that should be addressed through rigorous prospective randomized studies.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2025.

While clinical guidelines provide treatment recommendations for the most common disease-causing species, they offer limited guidance on managing treatment failures. This study aims to develop a consensus-based decision-making framework for addressing treatment failure in NTM-PD.A panel of 16 international experts used the e-Delphi method to address gaps in NTM-PD management. Initial statements were derived from an open-ended questionnaire, supported by a prior systematic review. Iterative rounds of expert evaluation were conducted until a consensus was reached on treatment failure definitions, decision-making criteria, therapeutic strategies and supportive care measures.Consensus defined treatment failure as the absence of culture conversion after 6 months of appropriate antimycobacterial therapy, while clinical and radiological deterioration were considered additional but non-mandatory criteria. Treatment intensification or de-escalation decisions were based on patient preferences, clinical status, comorbidities, disease severity, antibiotic tolerance, resistance patterns and previous treatment history. Treatment intensification highlighted the necessity for personalised multidrug antibiotic regimens. De-escalation strategies focus on delivering optimal, patient-centred supportive care while minimising pharmacological adverse effects, by opting for simplified antibiotic regimens, intermittent antibiotic courses for symptomatic control or the cessation of antimicrobial therapy.This study offers a structured approach to managing treatment failure in NTM-PD, addressing patient selection, treatment intensification, de-escalation and supportive care, while championing individualised strategies. Future research should concentrate on validating predictive factors for treatment response, refining therapeutic regimens and investigating host-directed therapies to enhance patient outcomes.Copyright ©The authors 2026.

41512208,2026-01-10,Investigating the Frequency and Outcome of Central Vein Sign and Paramagnetic Rim Lesions in Children With MOGAD.,"Central vein sign (CVS) is a common feature in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, but its frequency in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) varies significantly across studies. Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are described in MS, but not in MOGAD. Our goals were to evaluate the prevalence of PRLs and CVS in a large multicenter cohort of pediatric MOGAD. We compared CVS frequencies between acute vs remission phases, as well as with longitudinal dynamics of lesion evolution.In this longitudinal retrospective multicenter study, clinical MRIs were assessed from pediatric patients with MOGAD, who had (1) ≥1 brain lesion, (2) susceptibility-based imaging (SBI), and (3) follow-up MRI at least 3 months apart. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences were analyzed for lesion detection and resolution. SBI was used to assess CVS and PRLs following North American Imaging in MS Cooperative criteria.A total of 65 patients and 130 scans were included. A total of 520 lesions were evaluated. The most common reason for lesion exclusion was size (n = 143, large confluent lesions, n = 122, <3 mm, n = 21). CVS was detected in 97 of 327 (29.7%) lesions, with 32 of 65 (49.2%) patients having at least 1 CVS+ lesion. Patients with ≥1 CVS+ lesion (32/65, 49.2%) had a higher number of lesions (p = 0.002) and lesions suitable for CVS analysis (p < 0.001). Of the 31 patients with ≥3 brain lesions, 11 of 31 (35.5%) had >40% CVS+ lesions and 7 (22.5%) had >50% CVS+ lesions. Only 4 patients had ≥6 CVS+ lesions. The proportion of CVS+ lesions was lower in patients who had SBI acquired during an acute attack vs patients scanned during remission (16% vs 33%, p = 0.015). The rate of lesion resolution was higher in CVS- lesions (177/230, 76%) compared with CVS+ (42/97, 42%, p < 0.001). No PRLs were identified.Lesion pathobiology in MOGAD is heterogeneous. CVS identified persistent rather than transient lesions, with resolution more common among CVS- lesions.

41329901,2026-01-10,FLIPI24: A Modern Prognostic Model and Clinical Trial Enrichment Tool for Newly Diagnosed Follicular Lymphoma.,"Although most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) can expect an indolent course, progressive lymphoma remains the primary cause of death during the first decade after diagnosis. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of starting first-line (1L) immunochemotherapy defines a high-risk population with poor survival, but better risk stratification at diagnosis is needed.The FLIPI24 model was developed and internally validated to predict 24-month event rates using individual data from 4,485 patients treated with 1L immunochemotherapy from 10 observational cohorts of FL. Overall and cause-specific survival was further evaluated in FLIPI24 risk groups. External validation in the 1L immunochemotherapy setting was performed using the prospective observational Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort (N = 565) and three randomized phase III trials (N = 3,192); extension to all patients with FL (any 1L therapy) was performed in the LEO cohort (N = 1,445) and its Molecular Epidemiology Resource subcohort (N = 1,074).The FLIPI24 model uses age and four blood-based variables (hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and WBC count). FLIPI24 showed consistent performance across validation and extension data sets, which was superior to existing prognostic tools. Across the four external immunochemotherapy validation data sets, patients with high-risk FLIPI24 (23%-32% of patients) had significantly higher 24-month event rates (22%-35%) and inferior 5-year overall survival (77%-83%) compared with patients with low-risk FLIPI24 (29%-31% of patients, 24-month event rates: 10%-12%; 5-year OS: 96%-97%). Results were consistent when evaluating lymphoma-related death and when extended to all patients with FL.The FLIPI24 model robustly stratifies, at diagnosis, patients with FL at increased risk of lymphoma-related death versus patients with very low lymphoma-related mortality during the first decade after diagnosis.

41276180,2026-01-10,Microenvironment-targeted strontium delivery system reshapes redox homeostasis to halt degenerative cascades in intervertebral discs.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is mainly caused by oxidative stress, leading to cellular aging and breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Current treatments do not specifically or consistently modify the degenerative environment. To solve this, we developed pH-responsive, strontium-functionalized double-network microspheres (RGD-SA/HA-His-Sr, rSA-HHS) using microfluidic technology. This system combines three key components: RGD-modified alginate for mechanical support and better cell-matrix interaction; histidine-grafted hyaluronic acid for environment-triggered degradation at low pH and reactive oxygen species scavenging; and strontium ions bound through multidentate coordination to control antioxidant responses. The design allows for the controlled release of bioactive ions in acidic disc areas. In vitro tests show sustained ion release over 28 days, reducing cellular aging and inflammation in nucleus pulposus cells while increasing collagen type II and aggrecan production. In vivo rat models of IVDD demonstrate improved disc height and ECM regeneration. The rSA-HHS platform offers a multitarget approach by simultaneously addressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and biomechanical issues. This research highlights important antioxidant mechanisms and presents a new, precise method for disc regeneration that goes beyond single-target biomaterials.Copyright © 2025.

41508901,2026-01-10,Oral rehydration solution for the management of fluid and electrolyte disturbances in patients with an ileostomy: A scoping review.,"Ileostomy creation is common among patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Surgical removal or diversion of the colon can result in nutrition complications, most notably dehydration-a leading cause of hospital readmission-and increased risk of kidney injury. Existing studies on fluid and electrolyte management after ileostomy largely focus on short bowel syndrome or high-output stomas, overlooking the physiological implications of ileostomy creation, even in patients with normal output. Given the absence of standardized oral rehydration protocols and limited interventional data, a scoping review was conducted to map the current evidence on oral rehydration solutions for postoperative fluid and electrolyte management in adults without short bowel syndrome or high-output stoma. Comprehensive searches across five databases identified 5738 articles, of which 6 met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies examined adults with ileostomy for any standard indication in which oral rehydration solution use was a study objective. The included studies were methodologically heterogeneous, encompassing randomized controlled, crossover, double-blinded comparator, retrospective cohort, and qualitative designs. Collectively, available evidence supports a pivotal role for oral rehydration solutions in both short-term and long-term management after ileostomy, improving hydration and reducing complications. This review highlights the need for standardized, evidence-based oral rehydration regimens and underscores opportunities to reduce postoperative morbidity, kidney injury, and hospital readmissions while optimizing long-term outcomes in this growing patient population.© 2026 The Author(s).

In this study, we present a strategy for engineering multifunctional three-dimensional (3D) stem cell spheroids (Sphe-BP-IL4-BMP2) by integrating black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets coloaded with interleukin-4 (IL-4) together with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). BP nanosheets served as a biodegradable scaffold and a delivery vehicle, enabling sustained release of rhBMP-2 and IL-4 to enhance osteogenic differentiation and to promote anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization, respectively. The resulting spheroids exhibited a well-defined morphology, enhanced cell viability, and uniform BP nanosheet distribution. The in vitro studies demonstrated Sphe-BP-IL4-BMP2 has significantly upregulated osteogenic markers and ALP activity alongside potent immunomodulatory effects on macrophages. Further in vivo implantation into a rat calvarial defect model led to increased angiogenesis and accelerated bone regeneration without adverse effects.

This retrospective study aimed to identify the optimal MCIDs for commonly used PROMs in CSM.The CSM database from the Quality Outcomes Database SpineCORe Study Group was analyzed. Baseline, 3-month, and 24-month PROM values for Neck Disability Index (NDI), 5-dimension Euro-quality of life (EQ-5D) in quality-adjusted life years, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, and neck/arm pain numeric rating scale (NRS) were collected. MCIDs were calculated for each PROM using previously validated techniques. MCID values were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) with the North American Spine Society satisfaction scale as an anchor.A total of 1141 patients with CSM undergoing surgery were included in this analysis. Improvement of ≥30% from baseline was the optimal MCID for NDI and neck/arm NRS. At 24 months, the optimal percentage cutoff MCID for these instruments resulted in AUCs of 0.76, 0.72, and 0.67, similar to the 30% improvement method, with AUCs of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.67, respectively. Numeric cutoffs (0.065 at 3 months; 0.149 at 24 months) were the superior MCIDs for EQ-5D. For mJOA score, a severity-adjusted MCID outperformed other methods, yielding an AUC of 0.67 at 24 months. MCIDs were achieved in 63% of patients for NDI, 59% for neck pain NRS, 61% for arm pain NRS, 52% for EQ-5D, and 59% for mJOA score at 24 months.Using the Quality Outcomes Database SpineCORe data set, we defined optimal MCIDs for key PROMs in CSM. A ≥30% improvement from baseline was optimal in NDI and arm/neck NRS. An absolute numeric cutoff was superior for EQ-5D (0.149 at the 24-month follow-up).

This research study looked at a common heart condition called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiff and has trouble filling with blood. The researchers wanted to understand how obesity, a major risk factor for HFpEF, affects the small blood vessels in the heart. 

They examined 125 patients with HFpEF, some of whom were obese and some who were not. The researchers used specialized imaging tests to assess the function of the tiny coronary blood vessels in the heart. They found that patients with HFpEF who were not obese actually had a higher prevalence of coronary microvascular dysfunction - meaning their small heart blood vessels were not working properly. 

This was an unexpected result, as obesity is known to contribute to blood vessel problems. The findings suggest that the mechanisms driving HFpEF may differ between obese and non-obese patients. Understanding",Cardiology,
41512167,2026-01-10,Pomalidomide for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: After Trial Longitudinal Assessment Study (PATH-HHT ATLAS).,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) causes severe recurrent epistaxis, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, solid organ arteriovenous malformations, and a profound anemia burden. It is the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide yet remains without approved therapies. The multicenter U.S. randomized, controlled PATH-HHT trial demonstrated efficacy of short-term pomalidomide treatment of epistaxis in HHT. However, many critical questions regarding long-term safety, effectiveness, and utility for HHT-associated gastrointestinal bleeding remain. The PATH-HHT After Trial Longitudinal Assessment Study (NCT07018401) was a multicenter U.S. longitudinal observational study evaluating patients enrolled in PATH-HHT who continued pomalidomide post-PATH-HHT through a post-study drug access program, with ongoing close monitoring per PATH-HHT protocol and as mandated by FDA. Sixty-two patients treated with pomalidomide for HHT for up to 4.4 years were included. Significant, durable improvements in mean Epistaxis Severity Score (5.55 points [baseline] to 2.80 points [month 12], p<0.0001) and mean Hematologic Support Score (9.11 red-cell unit equivalents [RUEs] during 6 months pretreatment to 5.73 RUEs [months 7-12], p=0.0056) were observed. Pomalidomide was less effective for gastrointestinal bleeding than epistaxis, particularly in patients with high RBC transfusion requirements. Thirty-one patients (50%) dose-reduced from 4-mg daily, primarily due to neutropenia, but most maintained effectiveness at 2- or 3-mg daily. Over 105.2 patient-years of pomalidomide treatment, 0 patients developed peripheral neuropathy, 1 developed venous thromboembolism, and 5 developed serious infections. In conclusion, pomalidomide was highly and durably effective for HHT-associated epistaxis, albeit with nontrivial potential toxicities, and may be considered a routine long-term antiangiogenic therapeutic option for certain patients with HHT.

41511789,2026-01-10,Immune-Driven Expression in Inclusion Body Myositis With T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), reported in up to 58% of inclusion body myositis (IBM) patients, is a rare leukemia of cytotoxic or less commonly helper T cells. The range of myopathies in T-LGLL and the impact of coexisting T-LGLL in IBM are not well understood. Our objectives are to investigate the spectrum of myopathies in patients with T-LGLL and compare the clinical, serological, pathological, and transcriptomic features of IBM patients with and without T-LGLL.We reviewed two Mayo Clinic cohorts: (1) T-LGLL patients evaluated for myopathies (2003-2018), and (2) IBM patients tested for T-LGLL via T-cell receptor gene rearrangement or flow cytometry (2016-2022). We also compared transcriptomic profiles of IBM muscle biopsies with and without T-LGLL.Of 447 T-LGLL patients, 13 (2.9%) had myopathies, IBM being the most common (n = 7). Of 43 IBM patients, 9 (20.9%) had T-LGLL, with 5 diagnosed prior to the onset of weakness. Clinical and pathological features were largely similar between IBM patients with and without T-LGLL, except for milder finger flexor weakness and more frequent neutropenia (55.6% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) in the T-LGLL group. However, transcriptomic analysis of muscle tissues revealed a more immunologically active profile, with upregulation of T-cell and macrophage markers, elevated levels of IFN-γ gene and IFN-γ-inducible genes, heightened cytokine activity, and enhanced immunoglobulin production in IBM patients with T-LGLL.IBM is the most common myopathy in T-LGLL patients. While clinico-sero-pathological features were largely similar, transcriptomic differences suggest IBM with T-LGLL may represent a distinct, more immune-driven subtype.© 2026 The Author(s).

They found that IBM is the most common muscle disease seen in T-LGLL patients. While the outward symptoms of IBM were largely similar whether or not T-LGLL was present, the researchers discovered important differences at the genetic level. IBM patients with T-LGLL showed higher activity of immune system genes and proteins, suggesting their muscle disease may be driven more by an overactive immune response. This could mean IBM with T-LGLL represents a distinct subtype that may require different treatment approaches.

The nineteen studies included were peer-reviewed manuscripts focused on primary spine tumors, excluding abstracts, book chapters, systematic reviews, and metastatic studies.ResultsThe PT-Retro registry compiled data from 1495 patients across 18 primary tumor histologies, offering insights into recurrence, survival, and treatment paradigms. Key findings emphasize the importance of Enneking-appropriate (EA) resection in improving survival and reducing recurrence in tumors such as chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Genetic markers, including hTERT promoter mutations and rs2305089 SNP, were linked to prognosis in specific histologies. Benign tumors, such as giant cell tumors and aneurysmal bone cysts, demonstrated variable outcomes with different surgical approaches and selective arterial embolization.ConclusionsThe AOSKFT registries have significantly advanced knowledge in primary spine tumor management, emphasizing preoperative staging, surgical margins, and multidisciplinary approaches. International, multicentric registries are essential for studying rare diseases like primary spine tumors, enabling robust data collection, improved statistical power, and broader applicability of findings across diverse clinical settings.

41512289,2026-01-10,Postpartum breast cancer: evidence for a distinct phenotype.,"The incidence of early onset breast cancers (BCs) has increased, paralleling rising trends in delayed childbearing. We hypothesize that a distinct postpartum BC subtype (PPBC), identifiable by time since last birth (TSLB) and biomarker expression, contributes to this trend. We applied GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) to measure associations between TSLB and 71 proteins in 640 BCs from women ages ≤40 years included in the Young Women's BC Study. We analyzed data using univariable linear regression and multivariable Sliced Inverse Regression to account for higher order interactions among biomarkers. In keratin-rich segments, PR (p = 1.00x10-4) and PTEN (p = 1.00x10-3) were associated with longer TSLB; multivariable analyses revealed positive associations for GZMB (p = 4.00X10-4), SMA (1.00X10-4) and NF-1 (p = 1.00X10-3). In keratin-poor segments, univariable significant positive associations were found for PR (p = 2.00x10-4) and PTEN (p = 1.00x10-3), whereas CD20 (p = 3.00x10-4) and CTLA4 (p = 4.00x10-5) were negatively associated; multivariable significant associations were found for fibronectin (p = 3.00x10-5) and pan-Akt (p = 1.00x10-3). Associations persisted after adjustment for multiple comparisons and BC molecular subtypes. Associations including for PR, PTEN and CD20 were strongest among women with shortest TSLB. OPAL multiplex immunofluorescence assays for PR, PTEN, CD20, SMA and CTLA4, replicated several DSP findings, particularly when stratified by subtype and with compartment matching. In TCGA, RNA species linked to proteins associated with TSLB correlated strongly with a T cell exhaustion signature previously linked to poor prognosis among premenopausal women. These data support PPBC as a biologically coherent phenotype defined by TSLB and biomarker profile, with potential implications for prevention and therapy.© The Author(s) 2026.

41513883,2026-01-10,Patient-Perceived Overall Side Effect Bother at and After Cancer Treatment Discontinuation: An Analysis Using Commercial Cancer Trial Data.,"There is widespread interest among patients, clinicians, regulators and other constituents in post-treatment patient-reported cancer data. Side effect bother is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) that can capture an important aspect of tolerability. In this study, we examined side effect bother at cancer treatment discontinuation and post-discontinuation in commercial cancer trials. We sought to understand completion rates, the extent of bother and its association with other PROs.Data were evaluated from three trials in patients with solid tumours (renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer). Side effect bother was measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) GP5 item. Symptom items were drawn from FACIT and function items were drawn from the EQ-5D-3L. FACIT items, including the GP5, are on a 0-4 scale (higher = worse symptoms/bother), and were dichotomised as 0-1 (""low"") vs 2-4 (""moderate""). EQ-5D-3L items were characterised as no problems (1) and some problems (2-3). Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted separately for each trial.Among patients who received treatment, completion rates at discontinuation for most items were at least 70%, and 52% to 78% at follow up. More than 20% of patients had high side effect bother at and after discontinuation, and similar percentages were seen for symptom items and functioning problems. GP5 and most items were at least somewhat correlated (≥ 0.2 in nearly all evaluations).Persistent side effect bother and symptomatic and functional detriments at and after discontinuation suggest capturing this information post-treatment can inform understanding of tolerability, particularly with improved PRO completion.© 2025.

Understanding this is important because patients' experiences with side effects can significantly impact their quality of life and willingness to continue treatment. 

The researchers analyzed data from three clinical trials involving patients with solid tumor cancers like kidney and breast cancer. They measured how much patients were bothered by side effects at the time they stopped treatment, as well as in the period after treatment ended. They also looked at how side effect bother related to other symptoms and daily functioning. 

The key findings were that over 20% of patients reported moderate-to-severe side effect bother both during and after stopping treatment. Many patients also reported ongoing problems with symptoms and daily activities. These results suggest that capturing patients' experiences after treatment can provide important insights into the full impact of cancer therapies.

41514053,2026-01-10,A single-cell atlas characterizes dysregulation of the bone marrow immune microenvironment associated with outcomes in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite advances in treatment options. Although tumor subtypes and specific DNA abnormalities are linked to worse prognosis, the impact of immune dysfunction on disease emergence and/or treatment sensitivity remains unclear. We developed an Immune Atlas of MM by generating profiles of 1,397,272 single cells from the bone marrow (BM) of 337 newly diagnosed participants and characterized immune and hematopoietic cell populations. Cytogenetic risk-based analysis revealed heterogeneous associations with T cells of BM, with 17p13 deletion showing distinct enrichment of a type 1 interferon signature. The disease progression-based analysis revealed the presence of a proinflammatory immune senescence-associated secretory phenotype in rapidly progressing participants. Furthermore, signaling analyses suggested active intercellular communication involving a proliferation-inducing ligand and B cell maturation antigen, potentially promoting tumor growth and survival. Lastly, using independent discovery and validation cohorts, we demonstrated that integrating immune cell signatures with known tumor cytogenetics and individual characteristics significantly improves stratification for the prediction of survival.© 2025.

In this study, researchers aimed to better understand the role of the immune system in multiple myeloma by analyzing individual cells from the bone marrow of over 300 patients. They used advanced technology to profile over 1.3 million individual cells, allowing them to map out the different immune and blood cell populations present. 

The researchers found that certain genetic changes in the cancer cells were linked to distinct patterns in the surrounding immune cells. For example, patients with a high-risk genetic change called 17p13 deletion had immune cells that showed a heightened inflammatory response. They also identified signs of ""immune senescence"" - a premature aging of the immune system - in patients whose cancer was progressing rapidly. Importantly, the team discovered potential communication pathways between the cancer cells and immune cells that may promote tumor growth.

41514247,2026-01-10,Effectiveness of tuina and physiotherapy to manage pain for patients with chronic low back pain: a pragmatic randomized clinical trial.,"Chronic non-specific low back pain lacks a defined pathoanatomical cause, leading to diverse treatment methods including physiotherapy and complementary alternative medicine techniques such as Tuina. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tuina for managing chronic non-specific low back pain by comparing it to physiotherapy and a combination of physiotherapy and Tuina.In this randomized, parallel-controlled, single-blind trial, 204 participants aged 21 to 75 with chronic non-specific low back pain were randomly assigned to physiotherapy, Tuina, or combined therapy. Pain intensity and quality of life were measured with the visual analog scale, 36-Item Short Form Survey and the Oswestry Disability Index, alongside trunk range of motion. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, two months, and five months. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for within- and between-group comparisons, and post-hoc tests were applied to between-group comparisons.After two months, all groups had significant improvement in pain scores. Tuina was only significantly better than the combination treatment for reducing pain (p = 0.021; mean difference = - 1.04 [95% CI - 1.85 to - 0.23], Cohen's d = - 0.41). However, no significant difference was observed between Tuina and combined treatment against physiotherapy. Pain scores were not significantly different at five months in all groups. The physiotherapy (p = 0.019; mean difference = - 5.28 [95% CI - 9.44 to - 1.11], d = - 0.44) and combined (p = 0.028; mean difference = 5.59 [95% CI 1.17 to 10.01], d = 0.42) groups showed a significant reduction in Oswestry Disability Index scores compared to Tuina at five months. The combined group had significantly greater 36-Item Short-Form Survey than Tuina (p = 0.012; mean difference = - 71.15 [95% CI - 118.23 to - 24.06], d = - 0.47), but not significantly greater than physiotherapy.All treatment groups demonstrated improved outcomes post-intervention and at five months. Between-group differences in improvement were significant only for Oswestry Disability Index and 36-Item Short-Form Survey scores at five months.

41518136,2026-01-11,Voice and Speech in Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders.,"Motor speech disorders are early, common, and functionally limiting features of atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). These impairments are underrecognized and undertreated in neurology clinics.This review aims to characterize speech impairment in APDs, offer practical guidance for clinical evaluation, highlight the role of Speech-Language pathologists (SLPs) in diagnosis and management, and outline current and emerging management strategies.A narrative review was conducted by the Diagnosis and Treatment Working Group of CurePSP's Centers of Care, integrating literature and clinical experience to summarize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of motor speech disorders in APDs.Speech changes in APDs are often mixed dysarthrias with hypokinetic, spastic, and/or ataxic components, and may include apraxia of speech; these are frequently more severe and progress quicker than in Parkinson's disease. These features can assist in differential diagnosis and should prompt early referral to SLPs. Despite the high prevalence of speech and voice changes, comprehensive assessment of motor speech disorders is uncommon in neurology clinics. Current evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions is mixed. Digital acoustic analysis and neuromodulation offer promising directions for diagnosis and treatment.Early, collaborative management of motor speech impairment elevates care in APDs. Neurologists and SLPs must work together to improve recognition, diagnosis, and care.

41391462,2026-01-11,"Proton versus photon radiotherapy for patients with oropharyngeal cancer in the USA: a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.","Radiotherapy is an integral component of treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. Toxicity from the current state-of-the-art photon radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), has prompted the search for alternative, less toxic therapies. One such alternative that might de-intensify treatment is proton therapy. In this trial, we aimed to directly compare IMRT with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), both concurrent with systemic therapy, hypothesising comparable disease control and survival and lower toxicity.This randomised, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial was conducted in 21 sites (cancer centres or universities) in the USA. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with stage III or stage IV oropharyngeal cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IMPT or IMRT. All patients were treated with radiotherapy to 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the primary tumour site and cervical lymphadenopathy. The type, schedule, and dose of induction or concurrent systemic therapy were chosen locally by each institution's multidisciplinary tumour board and were consistent with international guidelines. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population; safety outcomes were assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, patients who received the assigned therapy). A non-inferiority margin of 9 percentage points for progression-free survival at 3 years was used. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01893307) and is closed to further accrual after prespecified interim analysis.From Oct 10, 2013, to May 1, 2022, 440 patients consented (median age 61 years [IQR 55-68], 399 [91%] male, 409 [93%] White); 221 were allocated to the IMPT group (with 160 [72%] receiving IMPT) and 219 to the IMRT group (136 [62%] receiving IMRT). At a median follow-up time of 3·2 years, progression-free survival rates for the IMPT group were 82·5% (95% CI 76·1-87·3) at 3 years and 81·3% (74·5-86·5) at 5 years; corresponding rates for the IMRT group were 83·0% (76·7-87·7) and 76·2% (68·0-82·6; hazard ratio [HR] 0·88 [95% CI 0·57-1·35]; p=0·005 for non-inferiority of IMPT). Overall survival rates after IMPT were 90·9% at 5 years versus 81·0% after IMRT (HR 0·58 [95% CI 0·34-0·99]; p=0·045). Treatment-related deaths occurred in nine patients; six in the IMRT group and three in the IMPT group. Deaths from disease progression occurred in 27 patients; 18 in the IMRT group and nine in the IMPT group. 5-year disease control rates for IMPT versus IMRT were similar between treatment groups (local recurrences 2·9% vs 5·6%, p=0·474; regional recurrences 3·4% vs 3·2%, p=0·860; and distant metastases 9·1% vs 8·9%, p=0·897). Severe lymphopenia was more common in the IMRT group (89% vs 76%), as were dysphagia (49% vs 31%), xerostomia (45% vs 33%), and gastrostomy tube dependence (40·2% vs 26·8%; p=0·018).IMPT showed non-inferiority to IMRT for progression-free survival, improvement in overall survival, similar disease control, and reduced high-grade toxicity relative to IMRT.

41521187,2026-01-12,"Biologics for bone regeneration: advances in cell, protein, gene, and mRNA therapies.","Bone fractures represent a significant global healthcare burden. Although fractures typically heal on their own, some fail to regenerate properly, leading to nonunion, a condition that causes prolonged disability, morbidity, and mortality. The challenge of treating nonunion fractures is further complicated in patients with underlying bone disorders where systemic and local factors impair bone healing. Traditional treatment approaches, including autografts, allografts, xenografts, and synthetic biomaterials, face limitations such as donor site pain, immune rejection, and insufficient mechanical strength, underscoring the need for alternative strategies. Biologic therapies have emerged as promising tools to enhance bone regeneration by leveraging the body's natural healing processes. This review explores the critical role of conventional and emerging biologics in fracture healing. We categorize biologic therapies into protein-based treatments, gene and transcript therapies, small molecules, peptides, and cell-based therapies, highlighting their mechanisms of action, advantages, and clinical relevance. Finally, we examine the potential applications of biologics in treating fractures associated with bone disorders such as osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, and bone tumors. By integrating biologic therapies with existing biomaterial-based strategies, these innovative approaches have the potential to transform clinical management and improve outcomes for patients with difficult-to-heal fractures.© 2026.

Despite multimodality therapy, the tumor carries poor prognosis. We report cytomorphological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular features of seven cases of DSRCT from four patients.A retrospective review of cytology smears, biopsies and molecular features of cases diagnosed as DSRCT at Department of Pathology, Henry Ford Health System, and Indiana University, USA between 2016 and 2022 were performed. A total of seven cases of DSRCT from four patients were included in this study. The cytological findings were correlated with concurrent or subsequent biopsy findings.All patients were male, with age ranging from 21 to 29 years. Two patients had primary tumor in the abdomen, one in the retroperitoneum, and one in the inguinal region. The tumors measured from 7.5 to 17 cm in size. Six out of seven cases showed typical hypercellular smears of small round cells with inconspicuous nucleoli, scant cytoplasm, and rare nuclear molding. The cytomorphology in Case no. 1 was unusual, showing discohesive pleomorphic tumor cells with large irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, occasional binucleation, and frequent mitotic activity. A subset of tumor cells demonstrated rhabdoid features. The tumor cells were positive for keratins (dot-like), desmin, WT-1, and CD15. In Case no. 4, the immunohistochemistry for desmin and WT-1 was unusually negative reflecting the variability of the staining pattern. Three cases were positive for EWSR1 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and one positive for EWSR1-WTI gene fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All seven cases had concurrent/subsequent surgical pathology diagnosis consistent with DSRCT.Cytologic diagnosis for DSRCT is challenging but can be achieved with appropriate cytomorphology, IHC profiles, molecular studies, and demographic information.

However, the high degree of expertise and manual analysis time required limits the availability of this assay. To overcome this limitation, we developed a data-enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline that accelerates and simplifies MRD analysis. Unaltered FC files from 171 B-ALL MRD-positive and 89 MRD-negative cases were processed through an AI pipeline trained with 31 expert-gated negative controls. Cluster-informed downsampling reduced FC files from 1.2 million to 155 884 cells per case, on average, (87% cellularity reduction), whereas preserving small MRD populations (median, 100% retention for MRD of <1%) and allowing for true percentage MRD estimates using a correction factor. A deep neural network cell classifier automatically identified normal hematopoietic subsets (macro-averaged F1 score of 0.86); and an AI measure of anomaly discriminated B-ALL from benign mononuclear (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.98) or B-lymphoid cells (AUC of 0.94). Manual analysis of AI-enhanced files was completed in only 1.01 minutes per case, on average (standard deviation of ±0.57); with 100% positive agreement with conventional analysis (for MRD of ≥0.01%), 100% negative agreement, and excellent quantitative correlation (R2 = 0.92). Our cloud-based AI-enhancement solution accelerates B-ALL MRD identification without compromising test performance and has the potential of facilitating B-ALL MRD analysis by more clinical laboratories.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

Data from previous outbreaks indicate lasting health problems in survivors. The long-term neurologic impact of EVD remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the neurologic and neurocognitive sequelae of EVD in pediatric survivors of the 2015 outbreak in Liberia.In this cross-sectional observational study conducted in Monrovia, Liberia, pediatric survivors of acute EVD aged younger than 18 years at the time of infection and older than 2 years at the time of the visit, along with their asymptomatic close contacts as controls, were seen at a median of 18 months after EVD. The single clinic visit included a neurologic history and symptom questionnaire, neurologic examination, and neurocognitive testing. Seropositive survivors and seronegative controls were included in analyses, with the t test used for continuous variables and the χ2 or Fisher exact test used for categorical variables.The cohort included 31 EVD cases and 41 controls, with a median age of 11 years (44% female). Neurologic symptoms that were reported significantly more frequently in cases than in controls included arm/leg weakness (67.7% vs 4.9%, p < 0.0001); problems with sitting, standing, or walking (22.6% vs 4.9%, p = 0.031); difficulty seeing (38.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.003); difficulty understanding speech (32.3% vs 0%, p < 0.0001); fecal incontinence (19.4% vs 0%, p = 0.0051); and lack of motivation (22.2% vs 0%, p = 0.0052). EVD cases more often demonstrated disability than controls on the modified Rankin Scale. EVD cases ""either sometimes or often"" faced consequences for poor behavior, became upset for unknown reasons, and had difficulty completing tasks independently more often than controls on executive function assessment. There was no significant difference between groups in individual neurologic examination components, frequency of uveitis, or cognitive test scores.Numerous neurologic symptoms were reported more commonly in EVD cases than in controls, suggesting that EVD may have a lasting effect on the nervous system.

However, there has been limited research on patients' informational preferences, including which elements of AI device labeling enhance patient understanding, trust, and acceptance. Clear and effective patient-facing communication is essential to address patient concerns and support informed decision-making regarding AI-enabled care.We evaluated 3 aims using simulated AI device labels in a cardiovascular context. First, we identified key information elements that influence patient trust and acceptance of an AI device. Second, we examined how these effects varied based on patient characteristics. Third, we explored how patients evaluated informational content of AI labels and their perceived effectiveness of the AI labels in informing decision-making about the use of AI device, building trust in the device, and shaping their intention to use it in their health care.We recruited 340 US patients from ResearchMatch.org to participate in a web-based survey that contained 2 experiments. In the discrete choice experiment, participants indicated preferences in terms of trust and acceptance regarding 16 pairs of simulated AI device labels that varied across 8 types of information needs identified in our previous qualitative work. In the single profile factorial experiment, participants evaluated 4 randomly assigned label prototypes regarding the label's legibility, comprehensibility, information overload, credibility, and perceived effectiveness in informing about the AI device, as well as participants' trust in the AI device and intention to use the device in their health care. Data were analyzed using mixed effects binary or ordinal logistic regression.The discrete choice experiment showed that information about regulatory approval, high device performance, provider oversight, and AI's value added to usual care significantly increased the likelihood of patient trust by 14.1%-19.3% and acceptance by 13.3%-17.9%. Subgroup analyses revealed variations based on patient characteristics such as familiarity with AI, health literacy, and recency of last medical checkup. The single profile factorial experiment showed that patients reported good label comprehension, and that information about provider oversight, regulatory approval, device performance, and AI's added value improved perceived credibility and effectiveness of the AI label (odds ratio [OR] range: 1.35-2.05), reduced doubts in the AI device (OR range: 0.61-0.77), and increased trust and intention to use the AI device (OR range: 1.47-1.73). However, information about data privacy and safety management protocols was less influential.Patients value information about an AI device's performance, provider oversight, regulatory status, and added value during decision-making. Providing transparent, easily understandable information about these aspects is critical to support patient determinations of trust and acceptance of AI-enabled health care. Information elements' impact on patient trust and acceptance varies by patient characteristics, highlighting the need for a tailored approach to address the concerns of diverse patient groups about AI in health care.© Xuan Zhu, Austin M Stroud, Sarah A Minteer, Dong Whi Yoo, Jennifer L Ridgeway, Maryam Mooghali, Jennifer E Miller, Barbara A Barry.

We aimed to determine the risk, associated factors, and clinical impact of recurrent CeAD.The STOP-CAD study was a multicenter international retrospective observational study of patients with CeAD treated between January 2015 and June 2022. Recurrent dissection was defined as a CeAD occurring at least 7 days after the diagnosis of the index event that affects a different artery or a different segment of the same artery. Patients were followed from day 7 up to 2 years. The absolute risk of recurrent CeAD over time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess predictors of CeAD recurrence.Of the 4023 patients included in STOP-CAD, 3836 (median age 46 years, 45% females) were eligible for this analysis. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 295 (97-720) days, 88 (2.29%) patients had a CeAD recurrence. Median time-to-recurrent CeAD was 53 (interquartile range, 18-157) days. The estimated risk of recurrent CeAD at 2 years was 3.22% (95% CI, 2.59%-4.00%). In multivariable analyses, younger age (adjusted odds ratios, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), migraine (adjusted odds ratio, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.14-3.07]), and fibromuscular dysplasia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.66-5.06]) were associated with CeAD recurrence, while presenting with an ischemic stroke was associated with a lower likelihood of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29-0.75]).

In the phase 3 CABINET trial, cabozantinib improved PFS compared with placebo in patients with advanced, previously treated, progressive extra-pancreatic NET (epNET) and pancreatic NET (pNET) of all grades. Here, we evaluate if these results remain consistent in a subgroup of patients with well-differentiated G3 NET.Patients with locally advanced or metastatic epNET or pNET were randomized 2:1 in independent cohorts to receive cabozantinib 60 mg daily vs placebo. We analyzed outcomes of the subset of patients with G3 NETs (Ki67>20%), combining patients in the pNET and epNET cohorts due to small sample sizes.24 patients had G3 NETs, 16 randomized to cabozantinib and 8 to placebo. Primary sites included pancreas (n=12); GI tract (n=7); unknown primary (n=3); lung/ thymus (n=2). Median PFS for patients with G3 NET treated with cabozantinib was 7.9 months vs 3 months with placebo (HR=0.15,95% CI:0.04-0.57, 1-sided log-rank P=0.0034). The confirmed overall radiographic response rate was 25% (4/16) with cabozantinib vs. 0% (0/8) with placebo. Safety outcomes were consistent with published data for the trial as a whole.Subset analysis of the CABINET trial showed improved PFS associated with cabozantinib vs placebo for G3 NETs of pancreatic and extra-pancreatic origin.

41524747,2026-01-13,Optimal timing of anticoagulation after ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Timing for anticoagulation (AC) initiation in atrial fibrillation (AF) after ischemic stroke (IS) remains uncertain. Previous large studies mostly represented high-income countries, with limited representation of severe stroke and low rates of primary outcomes. We aimed to compare AC initiation at different timeframes in a broader and more diverse population.We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinical Trials for trials and observational studies comparing early versus late AC initiation in AF after IS. The study groups were 0-4, 5-14, and ≥ 15 days. Primary endpoints were recurrent IS only and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Secondary endpoints included systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Sensitivity analysis focused on studies using direct oral anticoagulants and timing categories consistent with our classification.Our meta-analysis included 20 studies with 25,884 patients. Mean NIHSS was 6.14, with at least 3204 severe strokes. IS was similar between groups, but the 0-4 days strategy ranked first (P-score = 0.92). Sensitivity analysis showed reduced recurrent IS in the 0-4 days group versus the ≥ 15 days group (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.65; P < 0.01). ICH had no difference across all periods, 0-4 days versus 5-14 days (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.58-2.18; P = 0.14); ≥ 15 days versus 5-14 days (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.65; P = 0.75); and 0-4 days versus ≥ 15 days (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49-1.55; P = 0.63). No differences were observed in all secondary outcomes.Initiating AC 0-4 days after IS appears safe and may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke without increasing ICH, even in a more diverse population with higher-bleeding risk.© 2025.

PERT products composed of pancrelipase (under the brand names Creon, Zenpep, Pancreaze, Viokace, Pertzye) differ in formulation-specific attributes and access/coverage considerations. Multiple factors impact healthcare providers' (HCPs) decision-making when selecting an appropriate PERT. The current study's primary objective is to assess real-world EPI management practice and HCP perceptions of PERT products in the United States.An online survey was carried out with HCPs who had treated patients with EPI for ≥ 3 years and prescribed PERT products to ≥ 10 patients over a 12-month period. The survey collected de-identified data on HCP characteristics, prescribing patterns, and perceptions of PERT products across the domains of efficacy, convenience, and access. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and HCPs' perceptions were compared across PERT products.A total of 250 HCPs were surveyed comprising 124 specialists, 95 generalists, and 31 advanced practice providers. HCPs managed a median of 30 patients with EPI on PERT in the 12 months preceding the survey. The most commonly prescribed PERT products were Creon (84.0%), Zenpep (60.4%), and Pancreaze (59.2%), with fewer HCPs prescribing Viokace (27.2%) and Pertzye (16.0%). Specific factors considered in prescribing decisions included improvement in abdominal and bowel symptoms (83.6%), affordability (72.4%), and formulary/insurance coverage (72.0%). A significantly higher proportion of HCPs reported favorable perceptions of Creon over other PERT products. Perceptions of formulary/insurance coverage across PERT products varied, with 8.0-56.0% of HCPs agreeing or strongly agreeing that a prescribed product had good coverage. These findings were generally consistent across different provider types.HCPs consider multiple factors when prescribing PERT for patients with EPI. HCP perceptions varied across PERT products, and Creon was favorably perceived more often compared to the other therapeutic options. Various factors may contribute to barriers to treatment and should be addressed to improve access.© 2025.

41104834,2026-01-13,ID2 Suppresses Multiple Myeloma Cell Proliferation by Repressing the Activity of the Transcription Factor TCF3.,"Transcription factors and their cofactors are major and selective nononcogene dependencies in multiple myeloma cells. By performing a gain-of-function perturbation screen in human multiple myeloma cell lines, we identified the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) genes as putative suppressors of multiple myeloma cell fitness. Among them, ID2 was found to be downregulated in multiple myeloma patient cells and acted as a tumor suppressor by directly binding and repressing the basic helix-loop-helix factor TCF3, also known as E2A. Lower ID2 expression in multiple myeloma cells conferred a proliferative advantage by increasing TCF3 activity, leading to a dependency on this transcription factor. In contrast, ID2 overexpression reduced TCF3 binding to DNA, which resulted in cell-cycle arrest and a halt in multiple myeloma cell proliferation. The myeloma bone marrow milieu supported this process by further decreasing the expression of ID2 and enhancing TCF3 activity, partly via IL6, revealing a mechanism by which the tumor microenvironment affects multiple myeloma cell behavior.Multiple myeloma cells exploit the oncogenic and proliferative potential of TCF3 by downregulating the transcriptional regulator ID2, a process facilitated by the bone marrow microenvironment.©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",Blood cancer discovery,"Jan 12, 2026",2026,Jan,12,Mariateresa Fulciniti|Yao Yao|Tommaso Perini|Jessica Fong Ng|Anaïs Schavgoulidze|Shuhui Deng|Jian Cui|Jessica Encinas Mayoral|Francesco Ladisa|Ryan M Young|Charles B Epstein|Cassandra M White|Christopher J Ott|Annamaria Gulla|Shannon M Matulis|Adam S Sperling|Eugenio Morelli|Lawrence H Boise|Moritz Binder|Raphael Szalat|Mehmet K Samur|Kenneth C Anderson|Nikhil C Munshi,Moritz Binder,"Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Blood Diseases Institute, Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.|Laboratory of Age Related Diseases, Division of Genetics and Cell Biology and Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.|State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Haihe Laboratory of Cell Ecosystem, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.|Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.|The Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts.|Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology and the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.|Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Candiolo, Italy.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.","Mariateresa Fulciniti, Yao Yao, Tommaso Perini, Jessica Fong Ng, Anaïs Schavgoulidze, Shuhui Deng, Jian Cui, Jessica Encinas Mayoral, Francesco Ladisa, Ryan M Young, Charles B Epstein, Cassandra M White, Christopher J Ott, Annamaria Gulla, Shannon M Matulis, Adam S Sperling, Eugenio Morelli, Lawrence H Boise, Moritz Binder, Raphael Szalat, Mehmet K Samur, Kenneth C Anderson, Nikhil C Munshi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41104834/,"This research examines a potential new way to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow.

41525598,2026-01-13,Anatomic subsets of cholangiocarcinoma: More different than alike.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of biliary tract malignancies. Growing evidence underscores that the three major anatomic subtypes - intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA), and distal (dCCA) - are distinct tumor entities rather than a single disease. Each subtype differs in embryologic origin, carcinogenesis mechanisms, molecular landscape, and immunogenic profile, all of which contribute to variability in diagnosis, treatment responsiveness and prognosis. The importance of understanding these distinctions is reinforced by the rising global incidence of CCA, highlighting precision medicine approaches based on these subtypes. Recent advances have deepened our insight into subtype-specific risk factors, including chronic biliary diseases and metabolic conditions, while artificial intelligence-driven tools are improving diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. Surgical innovations now allow for more tailored resections and perioperative care, and therapeutic strategies are increasingly guided by molecular and immune profiling. Emerging strategies for early diagnosis and chemoprevention in high-risk populations further emphasize the significance of recognizing the unique biology of each subtype. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the distinct anatomic subsets of CCA, integrating their molecular and biological foundations with clinical management to inform practice and guide future research.Copyright © 2026 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Jan 12, 2026",2026,Jan,12,Yawen Dong|Hannah E Stumpf|Rory L Smoot|Patrick P Starlinger|Mark M Yarchoan|Gregory J Gores|Sumera I Ilyas,Yawen Dong|Hannah E Stumpf|Rory L Smoot|Patrick P Starlinger|Gregory J Gores|Sumera I Ilyas,"Department of Surgery, Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, Rochester, USA.|Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Oncology, Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Yawen Dong, Hannah E Stumpf, Rory L Smoot, Patrick P Starlinger, Mark M Yarchoan, Gregory J Gores, Sumera I Ilyas",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41525598/,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of cancer that starts in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine.

41526670,2026-01-13,Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guideline for the gene-drug interaction between CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and tricyclic antidepressants.,"The Dutch Pharmacogenetic Working Group (DPWG) aims to integrate pharmacogenetics into clinical practice by creating evidence-based guidelines to optimize pharmacotherapy based on genetic tests. The current guideline describes the gene-drug interactions between CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and various tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). For CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PM), dose reductions are advised for amitriptyline (reduction to 60% of the normal dose), clomipramine (reduction to 50% of the normal dose for the indication depression or in case of side effects at the normal dose for the other indications), doxepin (reduction to 40% of normal dose), imipramine (30% of the normal dose), and nortriptyline (40%). For CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IM) reduced dose is also recommended for amitriptyline (75%), clomipramine (70%), doxepin (80%), imipramine (70%), and nortriptyline (60%). Also, CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (UM) require tailored dose adjustments: amitriptyline (1.6 times the normal dose), clomipramine (1.5 times), doxepin (2 times), imipramine (1.7 times), and nortriptyline (1.7 times). Additionally, alternative drugs may be needed for CYP2D6 UM due to potential safety concerns. For CYP2C19 PM, a 70% dose reduction is advised for imipramine. For CYP2C19 IM, no action is required for TCAs. For CYP2C19 UM, an alternative medication is recommended for clomipramine prescribed for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The DPWG classifies CYP2D6 genotyping for all five TCAs and CYP2C19 genotyping for clomipramine in patients with anxiety disorders or OCD, and for imipramine as being ""potentially beneficial"".

41526676,2026-01-13,Deep learning-based classification of thyroid nodules using uncertainty-aware multi-modal ultrasound imaging.,"Accurate differentiation of thyroid nodules is crucial for timely diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Most recent studies utilize grayscale ultrasound with deep learning to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. The goal of this study is to effectively boost the performance of classification of thyroid nodules using multi-modal ultrasound imaging combining B-mode, color Doppler (CD), and shear wave elastography (SWE) within a customized deep learning architecture. This study prospectively included 506 thyroid nodules acquired from 422 subjects. The proposed network integrated a pretrained MobileNetV2 backbone with a shallow head composed of depth-wise separable convolutional layers, attention-based mixed pooling, and a tailored self-attention mechanism-applied for the first time in the context of thyroid nodule classification. To further improve robustness, we introduced a patient-level uncertainty-aware fusion strategy that selectively integrates predictions from each modality based on their validation scheme and achieved a classification accuracy of 0.95, a sensitivity (Sen) of 0.98, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99), a specificity of 0.92, and an F1 score of 0.95, on test data. Multi-modal images improved the performance (AUC: 0.97) as compared to uni-modal (AUC range: 0.73-0.90) or bi-modal (AUC range: 0.90-0.97) data. Further comparative analysis showed that the proposed network performed similarly or better to the state-of-art deep learning networks (AUC range: 0.82 -0.97) for thyroid nodule classification while utilizing relatively smaller architecture. Finally, the integration of multi-modal ultrasound imaging with a customized deep learning network effectively and efficiently improved the overall classification of thyroid nodules, which can further enhance diagnostic performance.© 2026.

Diagnosis to ablation time (DAT) was calculated from the date when the initial AF episode was documented. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding or cardiac arrest. Secondary end points included AF recurrence, all-cause mortality, and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalisation. Associations between DAT and post-ablation outcomes were evaluated by restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves based on Cox models.Out of 1145 patients (median age 67.0 years, interquartile range (IQR) 61.0-72.0; 36.7% female) included, 538 (47.0%) underwent early ablation (DAT ≤ 1 year), including 242 (45.0%) who received very early ablation (DAT ≤ 90 days). The overall median DAT was 423 days (IQR 118-1473). The L-shaped association was observed between DAT and the primary outcome (P for non-linear = 0.034). The lowest point was located at a DAT of approximately 1 to 3 years. For AF recurrences, the RCS curve rose progressively with increasing DAT (P for non-linear = 0.062), showing a reduced risk when DAT was less than 1 year. Effects of early ablation on the primary outcome favoured patients with initial AAD use (HR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.73 vs. HR 2.20, 95% CI p-interaction = 0.045).The benefits of earlier ablation in reducing AF recurrence might not equate to improvements in post-ablation cardiovascular prognosis.

In 2017, we implemented a cryptococcal meningitis (CM) diagnosis and treatment program (CM-DTP) designed to improve CM outcomes. In 2021, a meningitis diagnosis and treatment program (MEN-DTP) began to include all etiologies of meningitis to assess the impact of expanded diagnosis and treatment of meningitis. We conducted a retrospective study utilizing clinical records from 1443 adult patients admitted to Lira Regional Referral Hospital (LRRH) over three time periods between 2015-2024. Group 1 included 321 patients in a historical control group; Group 2 consisted of 890 patients during the CM-DTP and Group 3 included 232 patients during the MEN-DTP. Group 1 received routine meningitis care, Group 2 received testing and treatment focused on CM, and Group 3 received expanded diagnostic testing, including gram stain, culture, PCR- and antigen-based testing. Meningitis diagnosis and in-hospital mortality outcomes were assessed to evaluate our programs. A confirmed meningitis etiology was found in 13.7% in Group 1, 20.7% in Group 2, and 42.2% in Group 3. In Group 3, confirmed etiologies were identified based on culture (n = 30), Pastorex LA (n = 23), BioFire PCR (n = 56), GeneXpert Ultra (n = 14), and serum or CSF CrAg LFA (n = 53). Overall, more confirmed etiologies of meningitis were identified among people living with HIV (PLWH) (n = 319) compared to those without HIV (n = 22) in Group 3. Antibiotic use increased with pre-admission antibiotic use doubling from Group 1 to Group 3 (10.6% to 27.2%). Compared to Group 1, mortality improved in Groups 2 and 3. Overall, PLWH had increased mortality compared to those without HIV (32.4% vs. 13.3%).

There are limited prospective, multicenter data available on VBT following US Food and Drug Administration approval. We hypothesize that curve correction on first postoperative standing (first erect, FE) imaging is associated with higher rates of successful correction at final follow-up.All qualifying patients with AIS who underwent thoracic and lumbar VBT between 2019 and 2022 were prospectively enrolled from 9 institutions. Radiographic and clinical data were compared preoperatively, at FE, and at final follow-up with minimum of 2 years. Success was defined as major curve magnitude of ≤35° at final follow-up and no fusion surgery.One hundred twenty-seven patients were enrolled (79.5% female), with mean follow-up 2.4 years. Mean age at surgery was 12.9 ± 1.4 years, most had bone age of Sanders 4 or lower (93/112, 83.0%). In average, 7.6 ± 1.7 levels were tethered. Mean preoperative major curve magnitude was 50 ± 8°, with mean initial correction at FE of 29 ± 8° (% correction, 39 ± 18%). At final follow-up, mean curve magnitude was maintained at 26 ± 11° (% correction, 45 ± 23%) despite 29% of tether breakage. Patients who had mean FE curve magnitude of ≤35° were 88% successful compared with only 60% in those with >35° on FE (p = 0.0021). Patients showed stable sagittal alignment across all timepoints. Scoliosis Research Society-22 scores improved significantly by 2 years (p < 0.0001).This was the first prospective, multicenter study to assess outcomes of VBT for patients with AIS.
