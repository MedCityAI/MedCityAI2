41138264,Evaluating a calcium chloride-elastase combination for creating large aneurysms in the endovascular rabbit elastase model.,"PurposeLarge aneurysms have a higher rupture risk, yet no available in vivo animal model consistently produces large aneurysms for testing endovascular therapies. Recent research suggests that adding calcium chloride (CaCl2) to elastase yields larger aneurysms in a surgical rabbit model. We evaluated whether this effect translates to an endovascular approach by comparing aneurysm sizes created using elastase alone versus a CaCl2-elastase combination.MethodsAneurysms were created in the right common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. One group received 1 mL porcine elastase; the other received elastase plus 0.055 g CaCl2 (0.5 M). After four weeks, patency was confirmed via digital subtraction angiography. Two blinded co-authors measured the neck, width, and height of the aneurysms. Aneurysm volumes were estimated using AngioCalc.com. Statistical analyses were performed using either the Mann-Whitney U-test or t-test based on data distribution.ResultsTwenty-nine (29) New Zealand rabbits were included in the study: six in the CaCl2 and elastase groups, 23 in the elastase-alone group. All induced aneurysms remained patent at follow-up. Mean neck size was significantly larger in the CaCl2 + elastase group than in the elastase-alone group (4.4 ± 1.1 mm vs 3.5 ± 0.95 mm; respectively, p = 0.02). Differences in width (4.1 ± 0.92 mm vs 3.4 ± 0.36 mm; p = 0.06), height (9.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 9.1 ± 2.1 mm; p = 0.46), and volume (83.5 ± 38.35 mm³ vs 53.0 ± 16.94 mm³; p = 0.11) were not significant between CaCl2 + elastase and elastase-alone, respectively.ConclusionsCaCl2 modestly increased neck size but did not significantly enlarge overall aneurysm dimensions. Further studies are needed to assess its utility in endovascular aneurysm models.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Oct 25, 2025",2025,Oct,25,Bilgin C|Bayraktar E A|Ding Y H|El Hajj G|Oliver A A|Senol Y C|Kallmes D F|Kadirvel R,Bilgin C|Bayraktar E A|Ding Y H|El Hajj G|Oliver A A|Kallmes D F|Kadirvel R,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Department of Neurological Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Bilgin C, Bayraktar E A, Ding Y H, El Hajj G, Oliver A A, Senol Y C, Kallmes D F, Kadirvel R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41138264/
41137661,A comprehensive review of aneurysm clip materials and artifact reduction techniques.,"High-resolution imaging is critical for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and postoperative monitoring of cerebral aneurysms, which affect up to 5% of the population and pose a significant risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Surgical clipping remains a definitive treatment option, but metallic clips can introduce substantial imaging artifacts, complicating posttreatment assessment. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impact of aneurysm clip materials and designs on artifact generation and explores strategies for artifact mitigation. Conventional materials like titanium are favored for their biocompatibility and reduced ferromagnetism but still cause beam hardening, streak artifacts, and signal loss in CT and MRI scans. Emerging alternatives, including ceramics, composites, polymers, and bioresorbable clips, show promise in reducing artifacts while maintaining mechanical reliability. Innovations in clip design, such as fenestrated or low-profile models, further aid in minimizing imaging distortion. Advanced imaging methods, including dual-energy CT, iterative reconstruction algorithms, and metal artifact reduction software, demonstrate significant improvements in image quality but may introduce limitations such as increased processing demands or subtle anatomical distortions. Future directions emphasize the development of next-generation clip materials, robotic-assisted surgical approaches, and artificial intelligence-driven reconstruction techniques to further optimize visualization and patient safety. Continued research and multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential to translate these innovations into routine neurosurgical practice.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Oct 25, 2025",2025,Oct,25,Seymour T|Jazayeri S B|Ghozy S|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R,Ghozy S|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R,"University of Colorado Anschutz, Denver, CO, USA.|Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Seymour T, Jazayeri S B, Ghozy S, Rinaldo L, Kadirvel R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41137661/

41136681,Splicing Factor Mutations in Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia: Biological Consequences and Therapeutic Implications.,"This review will summarize recent research into the diverse biological consequences of splicing factor mutations, and possible therapeutic vulnerabilities uncovered by such mutations, with a dedicated focus on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.Splicing factor mutations dysregulate alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. The global nature of such dysregulation has pleiotropic effects on cellular function. Splicing factor mutations can alter NF-κβ and IFN-γ signaling, alter malignant hematopoietic cell differentiation, degrade the function of epigenetic complexes, and predispose cells to DNA replicative stress. Therapeutic strategies to target the altered biology of clones harboring splicing mutations have had varying degrees of success. Because splicing factor mutations are highly prevalent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and many other hematologic malignancies, an understanding of their downstream effects and therapeutic vulnerabilities is of key interest in the field. This review highlights recent developments and opportunities for targeted therapies.© 2025.

41137834,Comparative Outcomes of Intracardiac vs Transesophageal Echocardiographic Guidance for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion: Insights From EMERGE LAA Postapproval Study.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is commonly used to guide left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedures. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is emerging as an alternative imaging modality with potential advantages over TEE.The aim of this study was to compare outcomes from procedures guided by ICE vs TEE vs both for guidance of Amulet implantation in the EMERGE LAA postapproval study.Patients with Amulet implants entered into the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO Registry between August 14, 2021, and December 15, 2023. A safety composite endpoint of all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention through 7 days or hospital discharge was reported. Major adverse events were also reported through 45 days.A total of 11,848 patients were included in this analysis, with 433 (3.7%) using ICE only, 9,793 (82.6%) TEE only, and 1,622 (13.7%) ICE plus TEE. Median follow-up duration was the same in all groups (45.0 days; Q1-Q3: 45.0-45.0 days). Baseline characteristics were comparable across all groups. Similar rates of implantation success (ICE, 95.0%; TEE, 96.1%; ICE plus TEE, 96.2%; P = 0.324) and clinically relevant closure (≤3-mm peridevice leak) at 45 days (>95% for all groups) were observed. Procedural times were longer in the ICE (104.8 ± 44.7 minutes; median 98.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 78.0-122.0 minutes) and ICE plus TEE (98.8 ± 46.6 minutes; median 88.5 minutes; Q1-Q3: 71.0-116.0 minutes) groups compared with the TEE group (82.0 ± 39.2 minutes; median 75.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 57.0-99.0 minutes) (P < 0.001). The safety composite endpoint (ICE, 0.9% [4 of 433]; TEE, 0.9% [93 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 0.7% [11 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.36-2.66]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.43-4.31]; P = 0.585) and 45-day major adverse event composite (ICE, 7.1% [30 of 433]; TEE, 6.7% [651 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 5.7% [93 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 1.08 [95% CI: 0.75-1.57]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.27 [95% CI: 0.83-1.93]; P = 0.336) were similar between imaging groups. Procedural times and adverse event rates decreased as operator experience increased in the ICE groups.In the largest comparison to date, both ICE and TEE are safe and effective for Amulet LAAO guidance, with high acute success and closure rates. ICE was associated with longer procedure times that decreased with operator experience, potentially reflecting a learning curve.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

41134872,BMDD: A probabilistic framework for accurate imputation of zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data.,"Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.Copyright: © 2025 Zhou et al.

41133348,MR Elastography-Based Slip Interface Imaging for Assessment of Myofascial Interface Mobility in Chronic Low Back Pain: A Pilot Study.,"Abnormal restrictions at myofascial interfaces are a key factor in chronic low back pain (CLBP) with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), but no established imaging method exists for quantitative assessment. This pilot study evaluated the clinical feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) for visualizing myofascial mobility in CLBP-MPS patients versus age-/sex-/BMI-matched healthy participants. A new SII biomarker, maximal normalized displacement discontinuity (   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  ), was introduced, and the previously developed normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) map was used for comparison. Preliminary assessments of vibration-frequency effects, repeatability, and group differences in inter-muscular mobility were conducted.MRE was conducted at 30, 60, and 90 Hz to compare   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  with NOSS for visualizing inter-muscular slip interfaces at the quadratus lumborum-erector spinae (QL-ES) and erector spinae-multifidus (ES-M) muscle boundaries at L3-L4. Repeatability of   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  and NOSS was assessed at 30 Hz (identified as the best-performing frequency) using within-subject coefficients of variation and a linear mixed-effects model from within- and between-day scans. Clinical feasibility was then assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests in six CLBP-MPS patients and matched controls.D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  at 30 Hz exhibited superior delineation of slip interfaces compared to higher frequencies and NOSS.   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  demonstrated significantly lower variation and better repeatability than NOSS. Healthy participants showed continuous, well-defined slip interfaces, whereas CLBP-MPS patients displayed disrupted interfaces with significant mobility reduction at L4 ES-M.SII with lower vibration frequency and   D norm  $$ {D}_{norm} $$  map enhances visualization of lower back myofascial mobility and shows potential for assessing differences between healthy individuals and CLBP-MPS patients.© 2025 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",Magnetic resonance in medicine,"Oct 24, 2025",2025,Oct,24,Hojo E|Sui Y|Shan X|Zheng K|Rossman P|Waters T|Manduca A|Powell G M|An K|Ehman R L|Nanda S|Chon T Y|Bauer B A|Yin Z,Hojo E|Sui Y|Shan X|Zheng K|Rossman P|Waters T|Manduca A|Powell G M|An K|Ehman R L|Nanda S|Chon T Y|Bauer B A|Yin Z,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Orthopedics Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Hojo E, Sui Y, Shan X, Zheng K, Rossman P, Waters T, Manduca A, Powell G M, An K, Ehman R L, Nanda S, Chon T Y, Bauer B A, Yin Z",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41133348/
41133522,Risk stratification and early intervention in smoldering multiple myeloma.,"Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a biologically diverse precursor to multiple myeloma (MM), characterized by varying risks of progression. Several validated risk stratification models help identify patients at the highest risk, who may benefit from early treatment at the precursor stage. Current guidelines recommend treatment with lenalidomide, with or without dexamethasone, or participation in clinical trials for patients with high-risk SMM. Recent data also support using daratumumab monotherapy, which has been shown to significantly delay progression to MM. However, uncertainties remain about the long-term benefits of early intervention, especially regarding its effects on overall survival, quality of life, and the risk-benefit ratio in this asymptomatic group. This review discusses current risk stratification models for SMM, summarizes evidence from key clinical trials on prevention strategies, and highlights the evolving landscape of ongoing research.",Leukemia & lymphoma,"Oct 24, 2025",2025,Oct,24,Sra M S|Kumar S,Sra M S|Kumar S,"Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Sra M S, Kumar S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41133522/
41134013,Parameters Associated With Renal Recovery and Survival in Myeloma Patients With Acute Renal Failure to Cast Nephropathy.,"Acute renal failure due to cast nephropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we aimed to identify parameters associated with renal outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM patients with CAN-related acute renal failure and to validate the IMWG criteria for renal response. CAN diagnosis was based on biopsy or clinical assessment. Of 787 registered patients, 354 met the inclusion criteria, requiring at least two therapy cycles with documented chemotherapy response, renal response, and eGFR. Baseline free light chain (FLC) levels (median 6825.65 mg/L) decreased below 500 mg/L in 67.8% of patients. According to IMWG classification, renal complete response, partial response, and minimal response were achieved in 33.9%, 19.5%, and 28.0% of patients, respectively. The best eGFR values > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 33.9% of patients, while 33.3%, 22.3%, and 10.5% had best eGFR values of 30-59, 15-29, and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Renal response correlated with baseline FLC levels, IgG kappa, eGFR, and ECOG status in multivariate analysis, as well as with myeloma response and FLC reduction in univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 77.6 months. Survival correlated with age, myeloma response, ECOG status, FLC kappa type, baseline eGFR, standard-risk cytogenetics, and calcium levels, among other factors. A comparison of IMWG renal response criteria with classification based solely on best eGFR showed similar utility. Of 136 patients requiring dialysis, 80 (58.8%) were able to discontinue dialysis during therapy. Bortezomib containing myeloma therapy, along with significant FLC reduction, was associated with favorable outcome.© 2025 The Author(s).

41134301,Assessing Risk of Progression in Barrett's Esophagus Using a Mass-Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Panel.,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a critical precursor of EAC. Patients with BE undergo endoscopic surveillance to monitor disease progression even though only a small fraction develop EAC. These procedures are invasive and have limited accuracy in predicting BE progression. We evaluated the utility of an 8-protein mass spectrometry panel in predicting progression in patients with BE.Eighty untreated controls and 20 cases were selected from our institutional tissue registry. Quantitative mass-spectrometry was performed on micro-dissected tissue sections. Data were split into 80% training and 20% test sets. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized (LASSO) regression to train a logistic classifier on training data. Classifier performance was evaluated in test data.Ninety-two samples had sufficient tissue for mass spectrometry analysis (18 progressors, 74 non-progressors). The multivariable regression model produced a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 39% in the overall cohort, with AUCs of 0.75 and 0.89 in the overall and test cohorts, respectively. Cox proportional hazards time-to-progression (TTP) showed a hazard ratio of 66.1 (95% CI 7.79-561, p=0.00012) for the model prediction.The promising performance of the model generated here suggests that the test may aid in selecting patients most likely to benefit from active BE surveillance. Moreover, the association of this model's prediction with TTP may offer decision support for management of patients likely to progress quickly. These results support continued development of this proteomic panel as a risk stratification tool for patients with BE.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41134675,Compromised pressure-generating capacity of diaphragmatic muscle and its interaction with the lower rib cage at high lung volume during airway occlusion.,"The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm is generally thought to be compromised at high lung volume either due to loss of curvature or loss of its membrane tension. At a state of hyperinflation during airway occlusion at total lung capacity, the diaphragmatic muscle is forced to contract from an initial shorter length, the zone of apposition narrows, insertional force on the chest wall is reduced and abdominal compliance falls. We hypothesize that these altered mechanical conditions at high lung volume lead to a loss of the pressure generating capacity that is mediated by excessive muscle shortening rather than loss of curvature of its muscle fibers. . Using a biplane fluoroscopy, locations of radiopaque markers attached to the diaphragm muscle fibers and the lower three ribs of 10 beagle dogs weighing between 7kg to 10.5 kg were determined. Such measurements were conducted during quiet spontaneous breathing and during forceful inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway at three lung volumes spanning the vital capacity from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). Our data show that transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) at TLC was reduced by nearly 80% and surface area of the midcostal diaphragm muscle at contracted state during airway occlusion at TLC reduced by nearly 35% from its value at end of expiration. In addition, muscle fiber curvature were essentially maintained during the entire vital capacity of airway occlusion. Our data demonstrate that during airway occlusion at high lung volume, the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm is compromised primarily due to a mechanism that involved a combined mechanical effect of hyperinflation and excessive muscle contraction rather than a significant loss of curvature of its muscle fibers.","American journal of physiology.

41135121,Outcomes of distal sternocleidomastoid stump resection following selective denervation as revision surgery in refractory cervical dystonia.,"Cervical dystonia (or spasmodic torticollis) is a neurological condition that results in abnormal movements and head posture, for which initial surgical intervention typically involves selective denervation of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and paraspinal muscles. However, muscle reactivation of the distal SCM stump can result in recurrent symptoms. In this study, the authors present their preliminary experience with distal SCM stump resection following selective denervation, with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the procedure and identifying patients who may benefit from this technique.This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients who underwent SCM stump resection as revision surgery for cervical dystonia.A total of 18 patients (10 males [56%]) were included with a median (range) age of 54 (40-70) years. All patients received selective denervation of the SCM at the authors' institution prior to SCM stump resection at a median (range) time of 12 (3-198) months between surgical procedures. At preoperative baseline, 13 patients (72%) possessed a rotational torticollis component to their head deviation, 12 (67%) possessed a laterocollis component, and 2 (11%) possessed a retrocollis component. At the most recent follow-up (median [range] 16 [4-119] months), 6 patients had complete resolution of their cervical dystonia (33%), while 10 had residual deviation (56%) and 2 had recurrent deviation (11%). However, compared to their post-selective denervation head position, 12 patients experienced improvement in their head position (67%), 4 patients had no change in their head position (22%), and 2 had worsening of their cervical dystonia (11%) following SCM stump resection. Importantly, 12 patients experienced improvement in their pain following SCM stump resection (67%). Patients who had a history of other movement/spasmodic disorders were more likely to have improvement in head position and improvement in pain after SCM stump resection, though neither of these results achieved statistical significance (p = 0.054). Additionally, patients who experienced full resolution of their cervical dystonia had shorter time between initial selective denervation surgery and SCM stump resection, though this result also did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.068).Distal SCM stump resection following selective denervation is a simple, safe, and effective option for many patients in treating refractory cervical dystonia.

41136333,Vessel Wall Imaging at 7T: State of the Art.,"Intracranial vessel wall imaging (VWI) has emerged as a critical tool in neurovascular diagnostics, enabling direct assessment of the vessel wall, which conventional luminal imaging techniques cannot fully address. While commonly available 3T MRI systems have been valuable for VWI, limitations in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio hinder their ability to visualize medium and smaller caliber vessels. Ultra-high-field 7T-MRI, given its improved spatial resolution, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio, can help address these limitations. This review highlights the historical development of VWI at 7T, tracing its evolution from early attempts to key technical advancements, development of pulse sequences such as MPIR-TSE, SPACE, and CUBE, along with the later incorporation of CSF suppression techniques to further enhance lesion conspicuity. It also discusses the pitfalls and clinical applications of 7T-VWI in cerebrovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and aneurysms, demonstrating its ability to improve plaque characterization, monitor disease progression, and assist in treatment planning. Despite challenges, such as B1 field inhomogeneity and the lack of standardized protocols, 7T-MRI's potential for clinical application is evident, with ongoing innovations like deep learning-based reconstructions promising to further improve its feasibility in routine clinical practice.ABBREVIATIONS: VWI＝ Vessel Wall Imaging; CoW＝ Circle of Willis; MPIR-TSE＝ magnetization-prepared inversion recovery turbo spin echo; SNR＝ Signal-to-noise ratio; CNR＝ Contrast-to-noise ratio; SPACE＝ Sampling Perfection with Application-optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolutions; DANTE＝ Delay Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation; ICAD＝ Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease; UIA＝ Unruptured intracranial aneurysm.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41136334,The Incidence of Calcified Pituitary Macroadenomas: Challenging the Craniopharyngioma Assumption.,"Large sellar/suprasellar masses containing calcifications are classically associated with craniopharyngiomas. In our practice, however, we have noticed that some giant pituitary macroadenomas have calcifications. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of calcifications in pituitary macroadenomas.We reviewed an internal database for pathology proven giant macroadenomas (>4 cm). Basic patient demographics were collected, including age and sex. Adenoma subtype and maximum adenoma dimension were recorded. Preoperative CT images were reviewed for capsular (none, thin, coarse, or mixed) and internal calcifications (none, thin, coarse, or mixed). Pre-operative MRI images were also reviewed to further characterize the adenoma (solid, cystic, and mixed; T1 signal).45 macroadenomas were included. The mean size was 47.4 mm (SD: 6.2, Range: 40-70). 44.4% (95% CI 30.9-58.8%) of macroadenomas (20/45) had surrounding calcification. 10 (22%, 95% CI 12.5-36.3%) were from the expanded or destroyed dorsum sella, not the adenoma. 10 (22%, 95% CI 12.5-36.3%) cases had calcification directly from the adenoma. No cases had internal calcification. All were thin capsular calcification: 6 were thin, 3 were coarse, and 1 was mixed.Large sellar/suprasellar masses that contain calcification are classically associated with craniopharyngiomas. We evaluated pathology-confirmed giant adenomas and found that 22% demonstrated presence of calcifications on CT.GPM= Giant pituitary macroadenoma.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41136378,CHFR expression and sensitivity of breast cancer cells to antimitotic agents in vitro and in the I-SPY trial.,"CHFR, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously implicated in regulating the premitotic checkpoint and response to taxanes, is silenced in a subset of breast cancers. Here we assessed the impact of differences in CHFR expression on sensitivity to various antimitotic agents in vitro and on response to neoadjuvant taxane treatment in the clinical setting. Colony forming assays as well as live cell imaging in human breast cancer cell lines indicated that CHFR downregulation is associated with increased sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors as well as paclitaxel in vitro that reflects premature mitotic exit and increased multinucleation. To assess the relationship between CHFR expression and neoadjuvant taxane response, we utilized immunohistochemistry to examine CHFR expression in the inter-regimen biopsy from 81 patients on the I-SPY neoadjuvant breast cancer trial (NCT01042379) who had dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRIs before and after paclitaxel monotherapy. CHFRLow cancers had indistinguishable volumes before taxane therapy but smaller MRI tumor volumes after paclitaxel [median 0.07 cm3 (interquartile range 0-1.1) in CHFRLow versus 1.1 cm3 (0.02-5.0) in CHFRHigh cancers, p = 0.03 by rank sum test]. Moreover, there was a strong association between higher CHFR expression and lower relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative cancers (HR 7.8, p = 0.024). These observations identify CHFR as a potential predictive marker of sensitivity in ER positive breast cancer that warrants further investigation and suggest that CHFR might also be associated with response to certain other mitotic inhibitors.© 2025.

41137448,Treatment of children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia with calcitriol alone: A prospective open label study.,"Preclinical studies demonstrate that treatment with calcitriol attenuates skeletal complications in mice with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).To assess serum markers of mineral metabolism, nephrocalcinosis, skeletal microarchitecture, growth, and evidence of rickets following calcitriol monotherapy in children and adults with XLH.A 1-year prospective single-arm open-label study comparing baseline and 12-month outcomes.Participants were recruited from outpatient endocrinology clinics in the United States. Data were collected in a research unit.Eligible participants were ≥ 4 years old, not pregnant, with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≥20 ng/mL and normal serum calcium.Participants were treated with calcitriol, with dose based on serum and urinary calcium concentrations, for 1 year.The primary endpoints were change in serum phosphate and nephrocalcinosis (all participants) and rickets severity score (children). Secondary endpoints included changes in additional markers of mineral metabolism, skeletal microarchitecture parameters via high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (all participants), and height z-scores (children).Serum phosphate did not change over 12 months of optimized calcitriol treatment. Rickets improved in 2 of 4 children with open epiphyses; height z-scores were unchanged. Nephrocalcinosis scores remained stable. Adults had increased cortical thickness at the radius diaphysis (p=0.012). Serum alkaline phosphatase decreased in children (p=0.021) and parathyroid hormone trended lower in both children (p=0.065) and adults (p=0.063). 4 participants developed mild hypercalcemia and 2 developed hypercalciuria which resolved with calcitriol titration.Calcitriol monotherapy is safe and well-tolerated in XLH, with modest benefits on laboratory indices of mineral metabolism and rickets.© The Author(s) 2025.

40379458,Transvenous Embolization versus Surgical Intervention for CSF Venous Fistulas: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The efficacy and safety profiles of surgical and embolization techniques for CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) are not well-defined because of limited data and a lack of randomized trials.This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment and transvenous embolization for CVFs in patients with SIH.PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to September 2024.Clinical studies involving adults with confirmed CVFs, treated either surgically or through transvenous embolization, were included. End points analyzed included headache response, overall symptom resolution, radiologic treatment response, and complications. Meta-analyses were performed by using R software, applying random-effects models to calculate prevalence rates and their 95% CIs. Subgroups of surgery and embolization were compared by using the χ2 test. The quality of the studies was assessed by using appropriate checklists.""Endpoints analyzed included headache response, overall symptom resolution, radiologic treatment response, and complications. Meta-analyses were performed using R software, applying random effects models to calculate prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroups of surgery and embolization were compared using Chi-squared test. The quality of the studies was assessed using appropriate checklists.""Fifteen studies involving 321 patients and 354 CVFs were included, all of good quality. Both treatment modalities led to over 90% partial or complete headache response, with no significant difference between embolization (93.9%; 95% CI: 88.3% to 96.9%) and surgery (90.1%; 95% CI: 75.6% to 96.4%) (P = .43). Overall symptom resolution (complete response) was also comparable between embolization (59.1%; 95% CI: 50.5% to 67.1%) and surgery (70.7%; 95% CI: 44.7% to 87.8%) (P = .38). Radiologic response, measured by the Bern score, showed significant improvement postembolization, with no corresponding data from surgical literature. The retreatment/recurrence rate was 14% (95% CI: 9.9% to 19.3%), with no significant difference between embolization (15.3%; 95% CI: 10.3% to 22.1%) and surgery (11.3%; 95% CI: 5.7% to 20.9%) (P = .63). There was no publication bias among the reported end points.Lack of direct comparative effectiveness and small sample sizes heighten the risk of selection and confounding bias.Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both surgical treatment and transvenous embolization for CVFs in patients with SIH provide comparable efficacy and safety profiles. Future research should employ uniform definitions, standardized radiologic and clinical end points, and long-term follow-up to more rigorously evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of these approaches.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.
