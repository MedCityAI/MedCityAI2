40892609,Effect of Vericiguat on Total Heart Failure Events in Compensated Outpatients With HFrEF: Insights From VICTOR.,"In the VICTOR (Vericiguat Global Study in Participants With Chronic Heart Failure) trial, in a contemporary ambulatory cohort with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and no recent hospitalization, the primary outcome of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and cardiovascular death was not statistically significantly reduced with vericiguat. Vericiguat reduced risk of mortality but not HHF. In this ambulatory compensated cohort, time to first HHF may underestimate the overall worsening HF burden by failing to consider the high proportion of outpatient worsening HF events.This study aimed to determine the effect of vericiguat on the overall risk of worsening HF by incorporating the entire patient experience of worsening outpatient and inpatient HF episodes.VICTOR was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of vericiguat in ambulatory patients with HFrEF who had not experienced recent worsening (defined as HHF admission within 6 months or outpatient intravenous diuretic use within 3 months) and were on a background of high use of contemporary guideline therapy. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death or HHF. The current analysis provides detailed effects of vericiguat on overall worsening HF in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, including urgent care visits for intravenous diuretics or outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification.A total of 6,105 participants were randomized. Outpatient worsening HF was more common as the first worsening HF event (n = 851, 59.3%), compared with HHF (n = 507, 35.4%) or urgent HF visits (n = 76, 5.3%). Outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification was associated with increased mortality (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.47-1.94; P < 0.001). Overall worsening HF occurred in 686 participants (22.5%) in the vericiguat group and 748 participants (24.8%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-1.00; P = 0.047). The composite of all-cause death and overall worsening HF occurred in 917 participants (30.0%) in the vericiguat group and 1,004 participants (32.9%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; P = 0.016).In compensated patients with HFrEF on contemporary guideline therapy, worsening HF in outpatients was more common than HHF and was associated with higher risk of mortality. Exploratory analyses suggested a potential reduction in overall worsening HF events when both inpatient and outpatient settings were considered.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41159979,Tricuspid Regurgitation Across the Spectrum of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is linked to more advanced stages with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), but it may also develop at earlier stages of HFpEF, such as those with isolated exercise-induced congestion.This study sought to evaluate the prevalence, distribution, and prognostic significance of STR mechanisms across the spectrum of HFpEF.Cardiac structure, function, hemodynamics, and clinical outcomes were compared among patients with HFpEF phenotypes categorized according to the presence of PVD (pulmonary vascular resistance >2 WU), and elevation in filling pressure at rest vs provocation (leg-elevation or exercise), as well as according to the presence of atrial or ventricular STR (A-STR, V-STR).Of 1,091 patients (median age 65 years, 60.3% women), 669 (61.3%) had HFpEF (20.2% exercise HFpEF - PVD, 38.6% rest HFpEF - PVD, 15.5% exercise HFpEF + PVD, 25.7% rest HFpEF + PVD). Moderate or severe STR was present in 17.4% overall, but increased with PVD (6.7%, 11.6%, 18.3%, and 33.7%, respectively), although moderate or severe STR was still more common in exercise-only HFpEF vs noncardiac dyspnea patients (11.7% vs 6.5%; P = 0.047). Most STR (69%) fulfilled criteria for V-STR, but those individuals had similar atrial fibrillation prevalence and greater atrial remodeling compared with A-STR. V-STR was independently associated with composite of death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization (multivariable HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.10-2.65) as well as death and HF hospitalizations each alone, whereas A-STR was associated with increased risk of HF hospitalizations (multivariable Fine-Gray HR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.12-4.37).STR in HFpEF is associated with PVD and less strongly with higher resting filling pressure. Although V-STR is the more common phenotype of STR in HFpEF, these patients also have substantial atrial myopathy, suggesting a mixed mechanism. TR was more prevalent in exercise HFpEF and exercise pulmonary hypertension than with noncardiac dyspnea; with none in the latter group having moderate-severe or severe TR, highlighting the importance of exercise hemodynamics. V-STR conferred excess mortality and HF hospitalizations, but A-STR conferred only excess HF hospitalizations.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

41359838,Mapping epileptogenic brain using a unified spatial-temporal-spectral source imaging framework.,"Noninvasive electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) is a valuable tool for localizing and imaging brain activity, with significant potential to aid presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy (fDRE) patients. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, including interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures, each offer unique capabilities in estimating the epileptogenic zone (EZ). However, there is a limited quantitative understanding of how these biomarkers differ in source-imaging precision, requiring distinct processing pipelines. Here, we developed a spatial-temporal-spectral imaging (STSI) framework for precision source imaging, and quantitatively evaluated various epilepsy biomarkers for source imaging in 2,081 individual events (spikes, HFOs, and seizures) from a cohort of 42 fDRE patients, comparing results to clinical ground truth such as surgical resection outcomes and intracranial EEG-defined seizure onset zones. The STSI enabled quantitative comparisons across key EEG epilepsy-related biomarkers, with averaged localization errors of 6.67 mm for seizures, 8.73 mm for HFOs overlapping with spikes (pHFO), 10.28 mm for HFO-riding spikes (pSpike), 19.59 mm for general spikes (aSpike), and 36.53 mm for general HFOs (aHFO), respectively, for seizure-free patients. These findings indicate that HFOs overlapping with spikes is the most spatially accurate interictal biomarker for mapping the EZ. The proposed STSI framework not only establishes a unified analysis approach for epileptic biomarkers to enhance presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy, but could also generalize as a versatile tool for mapping event-related potentials, neural oscillations, and dynamic brain states, within a single framework to advance cognitive neuroscience research and clinical management of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Dec 16, 2025",2025,Dec,16,Jiang X|Cai Z|Gonsisko C|Worrell G A|He B,Worrell G A,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.","Jiang X, Cai Z, Gonsisko C, Worrell G A, He B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359838/,"The study developed a unified framework to map the epileptogenic brain using various EEG biomarkers, including interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures.

41399325,Recommendations for the diagnostic work-up of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis - Position Statement of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Vasculitis and Vasculopathy Task Force.,"Small vessel vasculitides (SVV) comprise a heterogeneous group of cutaneous SVV (CSVV) that can be skin-limited or systemic. Given their diverse forms and symptoms and the lack of a standardized diagnostic approach, it is crucial to establish clear and consensus-driven recommendations for diagnosis.To standardize diagnosis for the detection of the type, extent, potential causes or underlying conditions of CSVV.International experts comprised the panel. The Delphi panel data was collected through two rounds of questionnaires. Agreement was measured using an 11-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree). A 7-vote minimum was required for agreement on each statement. Delphi panel statements scoring 3-7 were discussed during the meeting.20 experts participated in the first round of the Delphi panel, while 17 experts took part in the second. They agreed that the diagnosis of CSVV relies on a combination of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and histopathology. Palpable purpura on the lower extremities is recognized as the most reliable hallmark for most SVV and a sign of immune complex vasculitis. When the latter is suspected, a skin biopsy for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) should be obtained from an early, partially blanchable macule because the type of perivascular immunoglobulin is important for further diagnosis. The proper selection of biopsy sites for routine HE biopsy depends on the morphology of lesions. A comprehensive medical history and selected laboratory testing should be conducted to investigate organ involvement, potential causes and associated conditions. The extent of diagnostic procedures should be based on the severity, duration, systemic symptoms and recurrence of SVV.Experts reached a strong consensus on the management of CSVV patients, culminating in the first International Consensus Statement for adult CSVV. This statement proposes a practical management algorithm and underscores the importance of collaboration in rare diseases management.© 2025 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Dec 16, 2025",2025,Dec,16,Alpsoy E|Caproni M|Wetter D A|Goebeler M|Levell N J|Schneider S W|Salavastru C|Velasco M L|Marzano A V|Akyol M|Dutz J|Jachiet M|Kawakami T|Mariotti E B|Maronese C A|Micheletti R G|Monfort J|Piette W|Ratzinger G|Szepietowski J C|Werth V P|Sunderkötter C,Wetter D A,"Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Türkiye.|Rare Diseases Unit, Azienda USL Toscana Centro, Section of Dermatology, Department of Health Sciences, European Reference Network Skin Member, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.|Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, European Reference Network Skin Member, University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.|Dermatology Department, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Norwich, UK.|Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.|Paediatric Dermatology Department, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.|Dermatology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.|Dermatology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.|Department of Dermatology, Sivas Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Medicine, Sivas, Türkiye.|Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.|Dermatology Department, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.|Division of Dermatology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.|Section of Dermatology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.|Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.|Department of Dermatology, Tenon Hospital, Paris, France.|Division of Dermatology, John H.

41400411,Epidemiology of Adult-Onset Nystagmus and Saccadic Intrusions of Central Etiologies: A Population-Based Study in Olmsted County.,"The incidence and clinical characteristics of adult-onset abnormal spontaneous eye movements of central origin remain poorly defined.We conducted a retrospective, population-based study using the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify all adults (age ≥18 years) in Olmsted County, MN, diagnosed with nystagmus or saccadic intrusions between 1970 and 2019. Cases involving childhood-onset nystagmus, physiologic, or peripheral vestibular nystagmus, as well as those with insufficient diagnostic information, were excluded. Demographics, clinical, and imaging data were collected, including nystagmus types, characteristics, and outcomes.A total of 208 patients were identified for the 50-year period, yielding a median annual incidence of 4.65 per 100,000 adults. The mean age at diagnosis was 56.2 ± 19.2 years and 43.3% were female. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (46.2%) was the most frequent subtype, followed by torsional (25.0%), downbeat (11.5%), and upbeat nystagmus (8.7%). The cerebellum was the most commonly affected region on neuroimaging, and strokes/transient ischemic attacks were the leading etiology. Specific lesion-nystagmus correlations included pendular and abducting nystagmus with pontine lesions (P = 0.009 and <0.001, respectively), convergence-retraction nystagmus with midbrain (P = 0.036), and thalamic lesions (P = 0.007). Torsional nystagmus was most frequently associated with ischemic strokes (P = 0.045), downbeat nystagmus (DBN) with central nervous system malformations (P = 0.008), and abducting nystagmus with demyelinating diseases (P < 0.001). At follow-up visits, approximately 60% of cases showed complete or partial improvement. Factors independently associated with nystagmus recovery included skew deviation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.667 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.234-5.768])), toxic-metabolic cause (aHR 3.378 [95% CI, 1.816-6.284]), absence of DBN (aHR 0.142 [95% CI, 0.050-0.407]), and absence of neurodegeneration (aHR 0.050 [95% CI, 0.007-0.372]).This is the first population-based study describing the incidence and characteristics of adult-onset central nystagmus and saccadic intrusions in North America. Distinct anatomical and etiologic associations were identified across nystagmus subtypes. Poorer recovery was linked to neurodegenerative diseases, and DBN, whereas nystagmus improvement was associated with toxic-metabolic cause and presence of skew deviation.Copyright © 2025 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.",J Neuroophthalmol,"Dec 16, 2025",2025,Dec,16,Rattanathamsakul N|Dahl H|Botello-Hernandez E|Tajfirouz D A|Chodnicki K D|Chen J J|Bhatti M T,Rattanathamsakul N,"Department of Ophthalmology (NR, HD, EB-H, DAT, KDC, JJC), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Division of Neurology (NR), Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Neurology (DAT, JJC), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and The Permanente Medical Group and Department of Ophthalmology (MTB), Kaiser Permanente-Northern California, Roseville, California.","Rattanathamsakul N, Dahl H, Botello-Hernandez E, Tajfirouz D A, Chodnicki K D, Chen J J, Bhatti M T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41400411/,"This study found that the incidence of adult-onset nystagmus and saccadic eye movements of central origin is around 4.65 per 100,000 adults.

41400652,Efficacy and safety of intravenous nerinetide in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy without thrombolysis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) nerinetide in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) without prior or concurrent IV thrombolysis (IVT).A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted through March 15, 2025, identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EVT plus nerinetide versus EVT plus placebo without IVT. Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with conflicts resolved by a third. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2.0. Data were synthesized using RevMan 5.4 with random-effects models, and heterogeneity was evaluated via chi-square and I2 statistics.Three RCTs comprising 726 patients in the IV nerinetide group and 668 in the placebo group were included. Nerinetide did not significantly improve functional outcomes: 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: [0.71, 1.47], P = 0.92) and mRS 0-2 (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: [0.93, 1.22], P = 0.35). No significant differences were observed in 90-day mortality (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: [0.60, 1.34], P = 0.59) or adverse events, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: [0.44, 1.45], P = 0.46).Nerinetide administration during EVT in AIS patients without IVT did not significantly improve functional independence, survival, or safety outcomes compared to placebo.

The present study sought to explore the cumulative impact of symptoms, treatments, and healthcare on the quality of life of individuals with NF2-SWN. We interviewed 16 adolescent and adult patients with NF2-SWN enrolled in the INTUITT-NF2 clinical trial and 10 clinicians with NF2-SWN expertise from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Analysis of patient and clinician interviews yielded five overall themes: (1) impacts on daily living, (2) impacts on life roles, (3) impacts on relationships and social integration, (4) impacts on psychological and emotional wellbeing, and (5) burden of treatment and healthcare. Multiple symptom areas contributed to impairments in quality of life across each theme. These findings reveal that quality of life in NF2-SWN is shaped not only by individual symptoms, but by their complex, cumulative impact-highlighting the urgent need for disease-specific tools and holistic care approaches that reflect the lived realities of patients across the lifespan.© 2025.

This manuscript introduces the proposed SRS-Lenke-Aubin 3D classification and evaluates its ability to provide a structured and clinically meaningful 3D characterization of spinal deformities in AIS.To maintain continuity with standard clinical practices, the system builds upon the established Lenke classification and introduces two complementary 3D descriptors: the orientation of the regional plane of deformation (ORPD) and the apical vertebral rotation (AVR). These indices capture transverse plane deformities at the regional and local levels, respectively. Each was independently assessed for the proximal thoracic (PT), main thoracic (MT), and thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) regions using calibrated 3D reconstructions from biplanar radiographs. A population-representative cohort of 285 AIS surgical cases was used to evaluate the system. ORPD and AVR values were translated into categorical modifiers using predefined clinical thresholds.The new SRS-Lenke-Aubin 3D AIS classification adds two transverse plane modifiers per spinal region-the ORPD and AVR-yielding a modular 3-tiered, 4-modifier system: Curve type (1-6), Lumbar spine modifier (A, B, C), Thoracic sagittal profile modifier (-, N, +), Transverse plane regional modifier (ORPD: 1-3) and Transverse plane local modifier (AVR: s, m, l). A broad range of ORPD × AVR combinations was observed across the cohort, reflecting the system's ability to capture transverse plane heterogeneity. Notably, similar coronal curve types often exhibited divergent transverse morphologies, underscoring the added value of these 3D descriptors in identifying clinically relevant variation.The SRS-Lenke-Aubin 3D classification enriches the existing Lenke framework by incorporating practical transverse plane descriptors compatible with standard imaging workflows. This system offers a clinically meaningful step toward more complete 3D characterization of AIS, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, assessing outcomes, and supporting future integration with automated 3D tools.© 2025.

41402269,An unbiased comparison of 14 epigenetic clocks in relation to 174 incident disease outcomes.,"Epigenetic Clocks have been trained to predict chronological age, healthspan and lifespan. Such clocks are often analysed in relation to disease outcomes - typically using small datasets and a limited number of clocks. Here, we present a large-scale (n = 18,859), unbiased comparison of 14 widely used clocks as predictors of 174 incident disease outcomes and all-cause mortality over 10-years of follow up. Second- and third-generation clocks significantly outperform first-generation clocks, which have limited applications in disease settings. Of the 176 Bonferroni significant (P < 0.05/174) associations from fully-adjusted Cox regression models controlling for lifestyle and socioeconomic measures, there are 27 diseases (including primary lung cancer and diabetes) where the hazard ratio for the clock exceeds the clock's association with all-cause mortality. Furthermore, for 32 of the 176 findings, adding the clock to a null classification model with traditional risk factors significantly increases the classification accuracy by >1%. However, there is minimal evidence for interactions between the clocks and sex or smoking (ever/never) status. Second- and third-generation epigenetic clocks show promise for disease risk prediction, particularly in relation to respiratory and liver-based conditions.© 2025.

41402333,Processing of natural scenes in the human pulvinar.,"Theories of high-level visual processing and object recognition have typically focused on ventral visual cortex, often overlooking potential contributions of subcortical structures. The pulvinar, via extensive connections with visual cortex, is well-positioned to play a role in high-level vision. Here, we investigated how the pulvinar represents visual information using a high-resolution 7 T fMRI dataset of responses to tens of thousands of natural scenes. Encoding models targeting different stimulus features revealed a pulvinar region selective for bodies and faces presented in the contralateral visual hemifield. Complementary model-free analyses demonstrated that this region is co-active with body- and face-selective cortical areas during natural scene viewing. These findings challenge cortico-centric models of object vision by demonstrating that principles of cortical organization, including functional clustering and hierarchical organization, also manifest in subcortex. Moreover, they highlight the value of using naturalistic stimuli to probe visual function.© 2025.

41402675,Lean MASLD in U.S. Adults: Undiagnosed Burden and Metabolic Features from NHANES 2017-2020.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), recently redefined from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affects a significant portion of the global population. While typically associated with obesity, MASLD also occurs in lean individuals, a subgroup often overlooked by current screening strategies. Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of lean MASLD is essential to guide appropriate clinical recognition and management.To estimate the national prevalence of MASLD among lean adults in the USA and assess the burden of undiagnosed cases using a nationally representative dataset.We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2017-March 2020, including adults aged ≥ 18 years with valid liver elastography results and without viral hepatitis or significant alcohol use. MASLD was defined by a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥ 274 dB/m on vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). Lean status was defined as BMI < 25 kg/m2 (or < 23 kg/m2 for Asian individuals). Undiagnosed MASLD was determined by imaging evidence without self-reported provider diagnosis. Analyses incorporated survey weights to generate nationally representative estimates.Among 2086 lean adults analyzed, the estimated national prevalence of MASLD was 6.4% (95% CI 4.1%-8.6%), corresponding to 3.8 million U.S. adults. Of these, 34.6%, approximately 1.18 million individuals-were undiagnosed. MASLD individuals had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and BMI within the lean range compared to non-MASLD counterparts (all p < 0.01). MASLD prevalence increased with worsening glycemic status, reaching 33% among lean individuals with diabetes.Lean MASLD affects a substantial number of U.S. adults and is frequently underdiagnosed. These findings underscore the need to refine current screening practices and develop targeted strategies for early detection in lean populations, particularly those with metabolic risk factors. Future research should focus on risk stratification tools to better identify high-risk individuals within this overlooked subgroup.© 2025.

41402904,Sex differences in cognitive decline and impairment: a scoping review in informatics literature.,"A scoping review was conducted to investigate knowledge gaps in the informatics research literature regarding sex differences in cognitive decline and impairment, identifying existing studies and areas requiring further exploration.Our scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA - ScR) guidelines. We searched Ovid and other databases (APA PsychInfo, EMB Reviews, and Embase) for studies on sex differences in cognitive decline and impairment, focusing on peer-reviewed informatics journals and conference proceedings from 2000 to 2025. The selected manuscripts were analyzed based on metadata statistics, study attributes, and thematic content.A total of 17 full articles met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in North America (n = 7) and the European Union (n = 5). More than half of the studies were published after 2020 (n = 10). Our analyses highlight key aspects of selected studies, including bibliometric metadata, study attributes (e.g., study types, methods, and data sources), and thematic findings. Statistical modeling (n = 8) and machine learning (n = 4) are the most widely used study methods. Majority (n = 11) of the publications are single-site studies, while the other multi-site collaborations (n = 6) have emerged among hospitals, academic institutions, and research institutions.Sex-specific disparities in cognitive decline and impairment remain a critical issue in healthcare. Most informatics research has primarily concentrated on identifying generic sex differences in cognitive decline and impairment progression, rather than exploring the complex underlying mechanisms such as observational studies with causal analysis. While these studies are valuable, they lack a holistic approach to understanding sex-specific disparities.There is a significant gap in using informatics to understand how biological, social, and behavioral factors contribute to sex-specific disparities in cognitive decline and impairment. This limitation underscores the need for more comprehensive informatics research that goes beyond mere identification to find the root cause of these disparities in healthcare.© 2025.

41402965,Histologic correlates of background parenchymal uptake on molecular breast imaging.,"Molecular breast imaging (MBI) has shown utility as a supplement to mammography in women with dense breasts. Background parenchymal uptake (BPU), which describes the level of Tc-99 m sestamibi in fibroglandular tissue on MBI, varies among women with similar density. Higher BPU is associated with greater breast cancer risk. The goal of this work is to investigate the histological correlations of BPU that may explain this association with risk.In healthy women with dense tissue on mammography, we prospectively biopsied regions of fibroglandular tissue exhibiting one of the extreme categories of BPU on MBI: either photopenic or marked. Tissue composition of specimens was assessed by measuring area of epithelium, stroma, and fat and counting lobules. Lobular involution status was assessed by an expert pathologist as either none, partial, or complete. Ki-67 index and estrogen receptor-alpha expression were also assessed. Histologic features of photopenic and marked specimens were compared.Biopsies were performed in 48 women (mean age 54.9 years [SD 11.1 years]), including 20 with marked BPU and 28 with photopenic BPU. Women with marked BPU were younger (mean age 49.9 vs. 58.4 years, p = 0.004), had higher body mass index (p = 0.01), and were more likely premenopausal (p = 0.005). Marked BPU specimens had a higher proportion of epithelium (14.5% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001), lower stromal content (44.8% vs. 84.2%, p = 0.005), similar fat (18.9% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.41), and greater lobule counts (15.5 vs. 6.3, p < 0.001) compared to photopenic specimens. Complete lobular involution was less frequent in marked tissue than in photopenic tissue (10.5% vs. 76%, p < 0.001). Ki-67 index was higher in marked BPU tissues (5.4% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.006), though the difference was attenuated after adjustment for epithelial area (p = 0.26). Estrogen receptor-alpha expression did not differ between marked and photopenic groups (25.6% vs. 28.4%, p = 0.12).Marked BPU on MBI is associated with greater epithelial content, less lobular involution, and higher proliferative activity-features characteristic of tissue at elevated risk for malignant transformation. These findings suggest that BPU provides functional information beyond mammographic density, supporting its role as an imaging biomarker for breast cancer risk in women with dense breasts.NCT01240278 || 11/15/2010 and NCT01588834 || 05/01/2012.© 2025.

40864019,Echocardiographic Changes With Mavacamten in Nonobstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Exploratory Insights From the ODYSSEY-HCM Trial.,"Symptomatic nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM) lacks approved therapies. The ODYSSEY-HCM trial (A Study of Mavacamten in Non-Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT05582395), the largest to date in HCM patients, evaluating the efficacy of mavacamten in symptomatic adults with nHCM, did not demonstrate improvements in its primary endpoints (functional capacity and patient-reported health status).This exploratory analysis of the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated echocardiographic changes in nHCM patients from baseline to week 48.Symptomatic nHCM patients were randomized to placebo or mavacamten (5 mg/d, titrated between 1 and 15 mg based on left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]). Echocardiographic assessments of LV systolic/diastolic function and left atrial (LA) function were performed at baseline and week 48.Among 580 randomized patients (mean age 56 ± 15 years, 45.9% women), baseline measures included LVEF (65.8 ± 4%), maximal LV wall thickness (20.8 ± 4 mm), LV mass index (122.3 ± 31 g/m2), average E/e' (13.3 ± 6), and LV-global longitudinal strain (-13.2 ± 4%). LA parameters included volume index (43.5 ± 16 mL/m2), reservoir strain (19.1 ± 9%), and conduit strain (-11.6 ± 6%). At week 48, there was significant placebo-corrected treatment difference with patients on mavacamten demonstrating significant reduction in maximal LV wall thickness (-2.1 mm [95% CI: -2.5 to -1.7 mm]), LV mass index (-3.8 g/m2 [95% CI: -7.1 to -0.5 g/m2]), and E/e' (-1.3 [95% CI: -2.0 to -0.7]), with a -5.3% [95% CI: -5.9% to -4.1%]; P < 0.01) reduction in LVEF. A reduction in LVEF <50% occurred in 62 patients (21.5%) in the mavacamten arm vs 5 (1.7%) in the placebo arm and recovered following drug interruption. Patients in the mavacamten group maintaining LVEF ≥50% throughout the study (n = 212) demonstrated an improvement in LV-global longitudinal strain at week 48 (-0.4% [95% CI: -0.8% to -0.05%]; P < 0.05). LA functional parameters including contractile (-1.1% [95% CI: -1.8% to -0.4%]) and conduit (-1.4% [95% CI: -0.6% to -2.3%]) strain also improved significantly at week 48 (P < 0.05), whereas LA volume was significantly reduced in patients without atrial fibrillation (-2.6 mL/m2 [95% CI: -4.7 to -1.11 mL/m2]; P = 0.009).Symptomatic nHCM patients treated with mavacamten demonstrated directional improvements in markers of LV diastolic and LA function, modest regression in LV hypertrophy-related parameters, but 1 in 5 demonstrated an LVEF <50%, which reversed following therapy interruption.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
