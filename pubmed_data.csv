41139188,"Low Versus High Ligation of Inferior Mesenteric Artery in Rectal and Sigmoid Cancers: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","The optimal level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) ligation in rectosigmoid cancer surgery remains controversial, with ongoing debate about the balance between oncologic adequacy and anastomotic integrity. This meta-analysis compared high ligation (HL) versus low ligation (LL) of IMA in terms of postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).A systematic search of 5 databases (inception-May 2025) identified 15 RCTs comparing LL and HL in rectal or sigmoid cancer. Primary outcomes included 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall complications, and anastomotic leak (AL) rates. Secondary outcomes included lymph node yield, operative time, and blood loss. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were performed.A total of 2576 patients were included. LL significantly improved 5-year OS (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 0.026) and reduced AL rates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51-1.00; p = 0.050), without compromising DFS or lymph node yield. TSA confirmed the OS benefit and robustness of AL reduction, with the cumulative Z-curve crossing both the conventional and trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit. LL was not associated with increased overall complications, operative time, or blood loss. GRADE ratings indicated moderate-to-high certainty for key outcomes.Low ligation of the IMA offers a survival advantage and reduced anastomotic leak risk without compromising oncologic safety. These findings support LL as the preferred approach in rectosigmoid cancer surgery, though further RCTs are warranted to strengthen the evidence for certain outcomes.© 2025.

41139184,Defining the Surgical Oncology Experience during General Surgery Residency: A Multi-Institutional Study from the US ROPE Consortium.,"Surgical oncology operative experience during general surgery residency is poorly characterized. We hypothesized that graduates pursuing the Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowship would have greater surgical oncology exposure and log more surgical oncology relevant (SOR) cases.Demographics, program characteristics, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case logs were collected from 20 general surgery residency programs in the US Resident OPerative Experience (ROPE) Consortium spanning 2010-2020. CGSO matriculants (CGSO group) were compared with graduates entering other surgical fellowships/practice (non-CGSO group). SOR cases included liver, pancreas, breast, endocrine, laparoscopic colorectal, and abdominoperineal resection.Among 1343 graduates, 80 (6%) pursued CGSO fellowships. Demographics, including sex, race/ethnicity, and underrepresented in medicine, were similar between groups (all p > 0.05). CGSO matriculants more often graduated from university-based programs with CGSO-trained faculty (95% vs 86%), dedicated surgical oncology divisions (81% vs 66%), and National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers (85% vs 68%, all p < 0.05). Median total cases were similar between groups; however, CGSO-bound graduates logged greater SOR procedures (162 vs 141), including liver (+4), pancreas (+10), endocrine (+7), and laparoscopic colorectal (+5, all p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with CGSO matriculation included departmental NIH funding (OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.18-19.79, p = 0.02), dedicated research experience (OR 5.62, 95% CI 3.02-10.44, p < 0.001), and increased SOR cases (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.01, p = 0.02).CGSO matriculants have a unique general surgery training experience and log more SOR cases, which could reflect efforts to prepare for fellowship and/or the influence of surgical oncology immersion on career interest. These data highlight opportunities to bolster CGSO recruitment and fellowship preparation.© 2025.

41138264,Evaluating a calcium chloride-elastase combination for creating large aneurysms in the endovascular rabbit elastase model.,"PurposeLarge aneurysms have a higher rupture risk, yet no available in vivo animal model consistently produces large aneurysms for testing endovascular therapies. Recent research suggests that adding calcium chloride (CaCl2) to elastase yields larger aneurysms in a surgical rabbit model. We evaluated whether this effect translates to an endovascular approach by comparing aneurysm sizes created using elastase alone versus a CaCl2-elastase combination.MethodsAneurysms were created in the right common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. One group received 1 mL porcine elastase; the other received elastase plus 0.055 g CaCl2 (0.5 M). After four weeks, patency was confirmed via digital subtraction angiography. Two blinded co-authors measured the neck, width, and height of the aneurysms. Aneurysm volumes were estimated using AngioCalc.com. Statistical analyses were performed using either the Mann-Whitney U-test or t-test based on data distribution.ResultsTwenty-nine (29) New Zealand rabbits were included in the study: six in the CaCl2 and elastase groups, 23 in the elastase-alone group. All induced aneurysms remained patent at follow-up. Mean neck size was significantly larger in the CaCl2 + elastase group than in the elastase-alone group (4.4 ± 1.1 mm vs 3.5 ± 0.95 mm; respectively, p = 0.02). Differences in width (4.1 ± 0.92 mm vs 3.4 ± 0.36 mm; p = 0.06), height (9.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 9.1 ± 2.1 mm; p = 0.46), and volume (83.5 ± 38.35 mm³ vs 53.0 ± 16.94 mm³; p = 0.11) were not significant between CaCl2 + elastase and elastase-alone, respectively.ConclusionsCaCl2 modestly increased neck size but did not significantly enlarge overall aneurysm dimensions. Further studies are needed to assess its utility in endovascular aneurysm models.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Oct 25, 2025",2025,Oct,25,Bilgin C|Bayraktar E A|Ding Y H|El Hajj G|Oliver A A|Senol Y C|Kallmes D F|Kadirvel R,Bilgin C|Bayraktar E A|Ding Y H|El Hajj G|Oliver A A|Kallmes D F|Kadirvel R,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Department of Neurological Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Bilgin C, Bayraktar E A, Ding Y H, El Hajj G, Oliver A A, Senol Y C, Kallmes D F, Kadirvel R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41138264/,"This research aimed to develop a better animal model for testing new treatments for large brain aneurysms.

41137834,Comparative Outcomes of Intracardiac vs Transesophageal Echocardiographic Guidance for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion: Insights From EMERGE LAA Postapproval Study.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is commonly used to guide left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedures. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is emerging as an alternative imaging modality with potential advantages over TEE.The aim of this study was to compare outcomes from procedures guided by ICE vs TEE vs both for guidance of Amulet implantation in the EMERGE LAA postapproval study.Patients with Amulet implants entered into the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO Registry between August 14, 2021, and December 15, 2023. A safety composite endpoint of all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention through 7 days or hospital discharge was reported. Major adverse events were also reported through 45 days.A total of 11,848 patients were included in this analysis, with 433 (3.7%) using ICE only, 9,793 (82.6%) TEE only, and 1,622 (13.7%) ICE plus TEE. Median follow-up duration was the same in all groups (45.0 days; Q1-Q3: 45.0-45.0 days). Baseline characteristics were comparable across all groups. Similar rates of implantation success (ICE, 95.0%; TEE, 96.1%; ICE plus TEE, 96.2%; P = 0.324) and clinically relevant closure (≤3-mm peridevice leak) at 45 days (>95% for all groups) were observed. Procedural times were longer in the ICE (104.8 ± 44.7 minutes; median 98.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 78.0-122.0 minutes) and ICE plus TEE (98.8 ± 46.6 minutes; median 88.5 minutes; Q1-Q3: 71.0-116.0 minutes) groups compared with the TEE group (82.0 ± 39.2 minutes; median 75.0 minutes; Q1-Q3: 57.0-99.0 minutes) (P < 0.001). The safety composite endpoint (ICE, 0.9% [4 of 433]; TEE, 0.9% [93 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 0.7% [11 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.36-2.66]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.43-4.31]; P = 0.585) and 45-day major adverse event composite (ICE, 7.1% [30 of 433]; TEE, 6.7% [651 of 9,793]; ICE plus TEE, 5.7% [93 of 1,622]; OR for ICE vs TEE: 1.08 [95% CI: 0.75-1.57]; OR for ICE vs ICE plus TEE: 1.27 [95% CI: 0.83-1.93]; P = 0.336) were similar between imaging groups. Procedural times and adverse event rates decreased as operator experience increased in the ICE groups.In the largest comparison to date, both ICE and TEE are safe and effective for Amulet LAAO guidance, with high acute success and closure rates. ICE was associated with longer procedure times that decreased with operator experience, potentially reflecting a learning curve.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

41137661,A comprehensive review of aneurysm clip materials and artifact reduction techniques.,"High-resolution imaging is critical for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and postoperative monitoring of cerebral aneurysms, which affect up to 5% of the population and pose a significant risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Surgical clipping remains a definitive treatment option, but metallic clips can introduce substantial imaging artifacts, complicating posttreatment assessment. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the impact of aneurysm clip materials and designs on artifact generation and explores strategies for artifact mitigation. Conventional materials like titanium are favored for their biocompatibility and reduced ferromagnetism but still cause beam hardening, streak artifacts, and signal loss in CT and MRI scans. Emerging alternatives, including ceramics, composites, polymers, and bioresorbable clips, show promise in reducing artifacts while maintaining mechanical reliability. Innovations in clip design, such as fenestrated or low-profile models, further aid in minimizing imaging distortion. Advanced imaging methods, including dual-energy CT, iterative reconstruction algorithms, and metal artifact reduction software, demonstrate significant improvements in image quality but may introduce limitations such as increased processing demands or subtle anatomical distortions. Future directions emphasize the development of next-generation clip materials, robotic-assisted surgical approaches, and artificial intelligence-driven reconstruction techniques to further optimize visualization and patient safety. Continued research and multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential to translate these innovations into routine neurosurgical practice.",Interv Neuroradiol,"Oct 25, 2025",2025,Oct,25,Seymour T|Jazayeri S B|Ghozy S|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R,Ghozy S|Rinaldo L|Kadirvel R,"University of Colorado Anschutz, Denver, CO, USA.|Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Seymour T, Jazayeri S B, Ghozy S, Rinaldo L, Kadirvel R",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41137661/,"Cerebral aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in the brain's blood vessels that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding.

41136681,Splicing Factor Mutations in Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia: Biological Consequences and Therapeutic Implications.,"This review will summarize recent research into the diverse biological consequences of splicing factor mutations, and possible therapeutic vulnerabilities uncovered by such mutations, with a dedicated focus on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.Splicing factor mutations dysregulate alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. The global nature of such dysregulation has pleiotropic effects on cellular function. Splicing factor mutations can alter NF-κβ and IFN-γ signaling, alter malignant hematopoietic cell differentiation, degrade the function of epigenetic complexes, and predispose cells to DNA replicative stress. Therapeutic strategies to target the altered biology of clones harboring splicing mutations have had varying degrees of success. Because splicing factor mutations are highly prevalent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and many other hematologic malignancies, an understanding of their downstream effects and therapeutic vulnerabilities is of key interest in the field.
