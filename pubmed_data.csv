41350436,The global epidemiology of acute kidney injury: challenges and opportunities.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating complication of acute illness that affects adults and children across multiple settings worldwide and is associated with the development and progression of chronic kidney disease, increased mortality and increased resource utilization. Over the past two decades, standardization of criteria for AKI diagnosis and staging and the publication of multicentre studies have led to improved understanding of the AKI spectrum and provided insights into the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, processes of care and the environmental and sociodemographic factors that influence care delivery and outcomes. Substantial advances have been made in the utilization of electronic health records, biomarkers and care bundles - structured sets of evidence-based treatment practices - to improve the clinical management of AKI. The emerging fields of artificial intelligence and digital health may also provide ways to reduce the burden of this disease. However, these developments have occurred mainly in high-income countries and have yet to improve care delivery or outcomes in low-resource regions. Progress in the development of specific treatments for AKI is limited, and important gaps in knowledge and clinical practice remain, particularly in relation to the 5R framework (risk, recognition, response, renal support and rehabilitation) for managing AKI. An urgent need exists to address the wide variation and inequities in AKI management worldwide.© 2025. Springer Nature Limited.",Nature reviews.

41294777,Phase-1 Cardiac Rehabilitation in Acute Heart Failure: Development of an Early Mobilization Algorithm Through Delphi Consensus.,"Literature on early mobilization and exercise training in patients recovering from acute heart failure (AHF) is promising. However, there lacks uniformity in the time of initiation, exercise prescription, safety criteria, and termination criteria. Thus, the aim was to develop a mobilization algorithm for patients recovering from AHF.A modified web-based Delphi process was undertaken involving 15 panelists from across the globe. In Round 1, new variables, modifications to suggested variables, and agreement-disagreement within the panelists were obtained. In Round 2, agreement on a 5-point Likert scale was obtained. In Round 3, the algorithm was compiled, and excluded statements were discussed via web-based calls. The new variables were grouped into themes via an inductive process. The level of agreement and rating for each statement were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including frequency and percentages. We used Kappa statistics to examine the level of agreement between the panelists for each criterion. The consensus criterion was defined a priori as statements with a mean rating of ≥4 on the 5-point Likert scale by ≥70% of the panelists and Kendall's coefficient of concordance ( W ) of ≥0.3 between panelists.From Round 1, 54 new variables were obtained. More than two-thirds (118/170, 69%) of statements reached consensus and reported a fair level of agreement between panelists ( W ≥ 0.3). The final algorithm with all its criteria received a 100% (13/13) consensus.Physician-referral criteria, physiotherapy assessment process, exercise prescription, safety criteria, and termination criteria were formulated for early mobilization and exercise training for patients recovering from AHF.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41347312,Novel Echocardiographic Staging Classification for Cardiac Damage in Chronic Aortic Regurgitation.,"Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is associated with significant cardiac remodeling, but the prevalence and prognostic impact of extravalvular cardiac damage remain unexplored.Adults with moderate or greater chronic AR identified on echocardiogram between January 2008 and July 2024 were included. Exclusion criteria were acute AR, hypertrophic and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, prior cardiac surgery, and valve stenosis. Cardiac damage was classified into hierarchical stages: no cardiac damage (stage 0), left ventricular damage (stage 1), moderate or greater mitral regurgitation or left atrial damage (stage 2), pulmonary hypertension or moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation (stage 3), and significant right ventricular dysfunction (stage 4). The primary outcome was the association between cardiac damage stages and all-cause mortality under medical surveillance.Of 4026 patients (median age, 72 [61-80] years), 78% had moderate AR, 11% had moderate-severe, and 11% had severe AR. Cardiac damage was present in 87% of patients: 14% in stage 1, 53% in stage 2, 18% in stage 3, and 2% in stage 4. In a multivariable model, including age, sex, AR severity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, cardiac damage stages were associated with mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.04-1.96) for stage 1, 1.58 (95% CI, 1.21-2.06) for stage 2, 2.78 (95% CI, 2.10-3.67) for stage 3, and 5.34 (95% CI, 3.67-7.76) for stage 4. Adding cardiac damage staging to multivariable models improved predictive accuracy for mortality, increasing the concordance statistics from 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.75) to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.77).Cardiac damage is present in nearly 90% of patients with moderate or greater AR and is associated with increased mortality, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac structure and function beyond the aortic valve and left ventricle.",Circulation.

41347694,The use of practice analysis to develop a content outline for a board certifying examination.,"Since the first physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) board certification in 1947, PM&R's board-certifying Part I Examinations have been created by volunteer subject matter experts (SME) in private and academic practices. The American Board of PM&R (ABPMR) relies on the SMEs to create the exam's content outline that is then used as the framework to craft questions for the exam. Although this is a rigorous process with representative specialties across the entire spectrum of PM&R, it relies on the opinions and experiences of these SMEs. Because PM&R has grown in many clinical directions, in 2023, the ABPMR determined that the content outline should more appropriately reflect an updated scope of practice for the specialty. To achieve this goal, ABPMR contracted a psychometric consulting company, with experience in high-stakes professional credentialing, to complete a practice analysis for PM&R.To develop an updated content outline for the PM&R Part I certifying exam that embodied the breadth of the specialty including the knowledge and skills required of a competent PM&R physician upon completion of residency training.Pursuant to this goal, the rigorous research methodology called practice analysis was employed. This article describes the process of practice analysis including project planning; use of focus groups; survey development, dissemination, and analysis; and decision making to determine content and domain weighting for the ABPMR Part I Examination. This information was used by SMEs to assemble a revised content outline to be used for future board Part I Examinations in PM&R.For the first time since its inception, the content outline of the ABPMR Part I Examination was successfully updated using a practice analysis method.

41347934,Cumulative Risk Assessment for De Novo and Recurrent Nonliver Cancer After Liver Transplantation Based on Pretransplant Cancer Experience.,"As cancer therapeutics improve, more liver transplant (LT) candidates will have a history of prior to transplant malignancy (PTM), an established risk for cancer posttransplant.This study provides granular analysis (with focus on nonliver PTM) of posttransplant cancer risk relating to PTM in 1105 consecutive adult LT recipients (2009-2019, N = 542 with PTM).PTM prevalence increased from 37.8% to 63.2% during this timeframe. Post-LT survival was lower (10 y: 61.2% versus 75.1%; P < 0.001) with higher cancer-related mortality (17.6% versus 2.2%; P < 0.001) in patients with any PTM. The higher cumulative incidence of cancer post-LT associated with PTM (59.7% versus 37.6%; P < 0.001) was not attributable to de novo cancer (38.5% versus 37.7%; P = 0.21) but to recurrence. Cancer recurrence rate (10 y) was lowest in nonliver/nonskin (""other"") PTM (10.6%) with mortality rates from recurrence of only 4% in this cohort. De novo cancers may present at more advanced stage in patients with PTM and lung cancer the most common nonskin de novo malignancy (PTM 21%, no PTM 7%). Family history of cancer was an independent predictor for de novo cancer.PTM associated post-LT cancer outcomes are dominated by skin and liver cancer recurrence and not recurrence of ""other"" cancers or de novo cancer. This data supports the guidance proposals for cautious liberalization of ""other"" cancer remission requirements before transplantation. As post-LT cancer is highly prevalent regardless of PTM status, adherence to posttransplant cancer screening and surveillance is critical to identify early cancer after transplant.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41347970,"POEMS syndrome: diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes.","POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, skin changes) syndrome is a complex paraneoplastic syndrome related to a lambda-restricted low-tumor burden neoplasm. The diagnosis must be considered in the context of what might otherwise be believed to be a ""monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,"" with unusual features including, but not limited to, peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytosis, and extracellular volume overload. Once a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is made, besides very specific supportive care, the treatments resemble those of multiple myeloma or solitary plasmacytoma of the bone. Based on case series, autologous stem cell transplant is still a favored therapy with durable remissions even without maintenance therapy. Even before the era of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T-cell engagers, and chimeric antigen receptor antibodies, 10-year overall survival approached 80%. Patients achieving a complete hematologic response have a progression-free survival of 88% even without maintenance therapy. Herein, a case of a patient with a less-than-average outcome is described to highlight some of the long-term challenges and complexities of managing patients with POEMS syndrome.Copyright © 2025 by The American Society of Hematology.",Hematology.

41347984,"JAK2 wild-type erythrocytosis: concept, differential diagnosis, diagnostic steps, and treatment approaches.","JAK2 unmutated/wild-type erythrocytosis is a prevalent condition encompassing a wide spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities. It is conventionally defined by the same hemoglobin/hematocrit thresholds as for polycythemia vera. Incidence has been reported to be between 0.13% and 4.1%. The most clinically relevant step in the workup of erythrocytosis is the exclusion of polycythemia vera through JAK2 mutation screening. Consideration of relative polycythemia, normal outliers, and the influence of erythropoietic drugs and comorbidities is also imperative. Distinguishing long-standing from newly acquired erythrocytosis further streamlines the diagnostic process. Hereditary erythrocytosis (HE) is lifelong and typically associated with a positive family history. Subnormal serum erythropoietin (EPO) suggests an EPO receptor mutation. Otherwise, oxygen tension at 50% hemoglobin saturation (p50) discerns between high oxygen-affinity hemoglobin variants, 3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, methemoglobinemia, and PIEZO1 mutations (low p50) and germline oxygen-sensing pathway/other rare mutations (normal p50). Acquired erythrocytosis results from hypoxia-driven factors (eg, cardiopulmonary, altitude, renal artery stenosis) and other mechanisms of EPO overproduction (eg, EPO-secreting tumors) or hypersensitivity, as well as EPO-independent mechanisms. Drugs (eg, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, testosterone) are also common causes. Idiopathic erythrocytosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, increasingly attributed to underlying genetic mutations/polymorphisms. There are currently no evidence-based treatment guidelines. Low-dose aspirin and/or phlebotomy (with frequency determined by symptom relief) might be considered on an individualized basis in the presence of hyperviscosity symptoms, cardiovascular comorbidities, and/or a history of thrombosis.

41348061,A Radiographic Classification of Capitate Morphology and Its Association With Kienböck Disease.,"Kienböck disease (KD), osteonecrosis of the lunate, has an unclear etiology. While there is a strong and clear association between KD and negative ulnar variance (UV), it is likely not the only mechanical factor. The capitate, which has a large joint surface with the lunate, may play a role in KD pathogenesis. This study investigated the association between capitate morphology and KD. We classified the capitate into three types based on the angle and length ratio of the capitotrapezoid (CT) and scaphocapitate joint lines: type I (short, vertical CT facet), type II (pentagonal with a large, oblique CT facet), and an intermediate type. We hypothesized that type II capitate increases capitate-lunate loading, leading to a higher incidence of KD.A case-control study was conducted, including 80 KD patients who underwent surgery between 2019 and 2024 and 467 controls with radiographs from suspected scaphoid fracture cases. Demographic data, UV, and capitate type were analyzed.The prevalence of type II capitate in the control group was 18%. Patients with KD had considerably higher rates of negative UV (35% vs 7%) and type II capitate (30% vs 18%) compared to the control group. Among 488 non-negative UV patients and 59 negative UV patients, type II capitate remained more common in the KD group (42% vs 17%). Multivariable analysis confirmed negative UV (OR = 9.2, 95% CI: 4.8-17.4) and type II capitate (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.5-5.0) as independent risk factors for KD.Our study introduces a radiographic classification of capitate morphology and establishes its association with KD. These findings suggest that, beyond negative UV, type II capitate is an associated factor, warranting further research into its mechanical and vascular role in KD pathogenesis.Diagnostic III.Copyright © 2025 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Therefore, we investigated the association of prediabetes, diabetes and HbA1c with change in global and domain-specific cognitive scores in cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults, as well as the potential effect modification by sex or age.This longitudinal study included 4236 CU persons aged ≥ 50 years from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ran linear mixed-effect models with baseline prediabetes, diabetes and HbA1c predicting longitudinal global and domain-specific (i.e., memory, language, attention/executive function, and visuospatial skills) cognitive z-scores and raw scores. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, medical comorbidity, repeated cognitive testing, and ApoEɛ4. We additionally ran models with sex and age interactions.Compared to normoglycemic individuals, individuals with prediabetes and diabetes showed poorer performance on cognitive tests, i.e., TMT-B, category fluency, and block design subtest over time. Additionally, the presence of prediabetes, diabetes, longer diabetes duration and higher HbA1c were associated with faster global and domain-specific cognitive decline over a median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 1-19). Three-way interactions showed that the effect of diabetes on decline in global cognition, attention and visuospatial domains was more pronounced in women than in men. Age did not modify the effect of diabetes or higher HbA1c on cognition.The results suggest that prediabetes and diabetes significantly shorten the timeframe before a potentially clinically noticeable change in global and domain-specific cognition is reached. Thus, lifestyle modification to reverse prediabetes and prevent diabetes could potentially reduce the rate of cognitive decline in aging populations. The findings differed by sex (i.e., the effect of diabetes on decline in global cognition, attention and visuospatial domains was more pronounced in women than men).© 2025 The American Geriatrics Society.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Dec 05, 2025",2025,Dec,05,Pink A|Krell-Roesch J|Syrjanen J A|Vassilaki M|Fields J A|Iglseder B|Aigner E|Kremers W K|Jack C R|Racette S B|Petersen R C|Geda Y E,Krell-Roesch J|Syrjanen J A|Vassilaki M|Fields J A|Kremers W K|Jack C R|Petersen R C,"Department of Geriatrics, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.|Institute of Sports and Sports Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|First Department of Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.","Pink A, Krell-Roesch J, Syrjanen J A, Vassilaki M, Fields J A, Iglseder B, Aigner E, Kremers W K, Jack C R, Racette S B, Petersen R C, Geda Y E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41348388/,"This study found that prediabetes and diabetes are associated with faster cognitive decline over time, particularly in the areas of attention, executive function, and visuospatial skills.

41348646,Quantitative Proteomics Links Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Metabolic Changes and Epithelial Differentiation Defects in Hyperoxia-Exposed Neonatal Airway Cells.,"Newborn infants especially those born preterm often require supplemental oxygen therapy, however, exposure to supraphysiological oxygen (hyperoxia) can disrupt normal lung development and contribute to neonatal lung injury, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a contributor to oxidative lung diseases including BPD. However, the effects of hyperoxia on mitochondrial function and mucociliary differentiation in the developing airway epithelium remain poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia impairs neonatal airway mucociliary differentiation by disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Neonatal tracheal airway epithelial cells (nTAECs) from term infants (n=5) were cultured in a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model and exposed to 60% O₂ during the mid-phase of differentiation (ALI day 7-14). Cellular phenotype was assessed using immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analyses. Mitochondrial function was evaluated through Seahorse metabolic flux analysis, and global protein changes were characterized by quantitative proteomics. Hyperoxia significantly impaired terminal differentiation with reduced ciliated and goblet cells. Seahorse assay revealed a decrease in baseline oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ATP production, accompanied by a compensatory increase in glycolytic ATP production. Quantitative proteomics identified disruption of mitochondrial Complex I as a central feature of the hyperoxic response. Downstream proteomic pathway analyses further confirmed the metabolic shift from mitochondrial to glycolytic ATP production and demonstrated altered epithelial differentiation pathways, including NOTCH and TGF-β signaling. These findings reveal that hyperoxia impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and alters metabolic programming, leading to disrupted mucociliary differentiation. Future studies should evaluate mitochondrial oxidative fitness as a therapeutic target in neonatal lung disease.",American journal of physiology.

This metabolic change leads to defects in the cells' ability to fully differentiate into the specialized cell types needed for proper lung function. These findings suggest that targeting mitochondrial health could be a promising approach for treating lung diseases in newborns.
41348898,Foundations of Systems-Based Hematology: Thematic Analysis of Expert Interviews to Guide Curriculums and Promote Growth.,"Systems-Based Hematology (SBH) is an emerging discipline focused on optimizing care delivery for patients with hematologic disorders within complex healthcare systems. Despite growing importance, the field lacks a formal definition, standardized curriculum, and clear career pathway, hindering widespread adoption and training of future SBH experts. We sought to define core principles, competencies, challenges, and future directions of SBH to identify foundational components for a potential educational curriculum. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight SBH experts. Expert participants were identified through their committee involvement with the American Society of Hematology. Five overarching themes emerged: The Accidental Expert: SBH careers have developed organically and reactively in response to pressing institutional needs, not through formal training; Defining the Unseen: experts define the field pragmatically by its function and roles; The SBH Toolkit: success requires a hybrid skillset combining clinical hematology expertise with Health Systems Science (HSS) principles; The Architect's Dilemma: the field's growth is hindered by interdependent challenges of building a curriculum, awareness, and securing resources; Charting the Future: the discipline is poised for growth, driven by increasing healthcare complexity and specialization.SBH represents the nexus of HSS principles and hematology care. Formalizing SBH requires a multi-pronged approach, including developing a standardized curriculum that equips learners with a hybrid skillset, creating clear value for health systems and patients, and fostering a community of practice through professional societies. These findings provide a foundational framework for developing educational resources and institutional support necessary to continue advancing SBH.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Dec 05, 2025",2025,Dec,05,Godby R C|Cogan J C|Cuker A|Garcia D A|Lim M Y|Masias C|May J E|Morton C T|Schaefer J K|Shah S|Zumberg M|Marshall A L,Godby R C|Shah S,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.|University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.|Miami Cancer Institute - Baptist Health South Florida, Coral Gables, Florida, United States.|University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.|Mayo clinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, United States.|University of Florida Health, Gainesville, Florida, United States.","Godby R C, Cogan J C, Cuker A, Garcia D A, Lim M Y, Masias C, May J E, Morton C T, Schaefer J K, Shah S, Zumberg M, Marshall A L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41348898/,"Systems-Based Hematology (SBH) is an emerging field that focuses on optimizing care for patients with blood disorders within complex healthcare systems.

It explores model types, input features, validation strategies, performance metrics, clinical integration, and implementation challenges.A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL for studies published between January 2015 and March 2025.Eligible studies included those developing or validating AI models for adult inpatient sepsis prediction using electronic health record data and reporting at least one performance metric (area under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, or F1 score). Studies focusing on pediatric populations, lacking quantitative evaluation, or unpublished in peer-reviewed journals were excluded.Data extraction followed preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Extracted variables included study design, patient population, model type, input features, validation approach, and performance outcomes.A total of 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most used retrospective designs, with limited prospective or real-time clinical validation. Commonly used algorithms included random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, and deep learning architectures (long short-term memory, convolutional neural network). Input data varied from structured sources (vital signs, laboratory values, demographics) to unstructured clinical notes processed via natural language processing. Reported AUC values ranged from 0.79 to 0.96, indicating strong predictive performance across models.AI models demonstrate significant promise for early sepsis detection, outperforming conventional scoring systems in many cases. However, generalizability, interpretability, and clinical implementation remain major challenges. Future research should emphasize externally validated, explainable, and scalable AI solutions integrated into real-time clinical workflows.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.
