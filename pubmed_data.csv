41294777,Phase-1 Cardiac Rehabilitation in Acute Heart Failure: Development of an Early Mobilization Algorithm Through Delphi Consensus.,"Literature on early mobilization and exercise training in patients recovering from acute heart failure (AHF) is promising. However, there lacks uniformity in the time of initiation, exercise prescription, safety criteria, and termination criteria. Thus, the aim was to develop a mobilization algorithm for patients recovering from AHF.A modified web-based Delphi process was undertaken involving 15 panelists from across the globe. In Round 1, new variables, modifications to suggested variables, and agreement-disagreement within the panelists were obtained. In Round 2, agreement on a 5-point Likert scale was obtained. In Round 3, the algorithm was compiled, and excluded statements were discussed via web-based calls. The new variables were grouped into themes via an inductive process. The level of agreement and rating for each statement were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including frequency and percentages. We used Kappa statistics to examine the level of agreement between the panelists for each criterion. The consensus criterion was defined a priori as statements with a mean rating of ≥4 on the 5-point Likert scale by ≥70% of the panelists and Kendall's coefficient of concordance ( W ) of ≥0.3 between panelists.From Round 1, 54 new variables were obtained. More than two-thirds (118/170, 69%) of statements reached consensus and reported a fair level of agreement between panelists ( W ≥ 0.3). The final algorithm with all its criteria received a 100% (13/13) consensus.Physician-referral criteria, physiotherapy assessment process, exercise prescription, safety criteria, and termination criteria were formulated for early mobilization and exercise training for patients recovering from AHF.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41345797,"Free-Breathing, 3D Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Elastography for Myocardial Stiffness Mapping.","Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) of the heart has predominantly utilized breath-held acquisitions with limited anatomic coverage. This work investigates the feasibility of 3D, free-breathing cardiac MRE.A 3D hybrid radial and EPI acquisition is utilized and combined with retrospective binning of k-space via physiologic monitoring, iterative reconstruction, MRE processing and inversions, and post-processing specialized for cardiac imaging.Feasibility of free-breathing stiffness mapping of the left ventricular myocardium was demonstrated in 11 participants. Myocardial stiffness estimates were obtained throughout the left ventricle for seven temporal states of the cardiac cycle. Stiffness estimates were presented in participant-specific images, 17-segment bullseye plots, and stiffness plots throughout the cardiac cycle. Results indicate increased stiffness in systolic states, with localized stiffness heterogeneity observed between participants, illustrating a key benefit of 3D cardiac MRE acquisition. Mean stiffness estimates obtained through 11 subjects were 4.44 ± 0.68 kPa (begin-systole), 5.74 ± 0.94, 5.42 ± 0.87 (end-systole), 3.84 ± 0.71 (begin-diastole), 3.51 ± 0.74, 3.54 ± 0.52, and 3.55 ± 0.59 kPa (end-diastole). Statistical testing indicated significant differences in stiffness across cardiac states with one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA (p < 0.001) and Friedman's test (p < 0.001). Experiments in scanning three participants with and without applied motion indicated that stiffness changes were more robustly detected in systole than in diastole, although patterns were subject-specific. Comparison of free-breathing stiffness measurements against reference breath-held measurements yielded similar systolic stiffness estimates.This study establishes the feasibility of free-breathing, 3D cardiac MRE in healthy volunteers. With the current framework, stiffness estimation appears more robust in systole, and the reliability of diastolic estimates is limited and subject-specific.© 2025 The Author(s).

40473247,Collapse of interictal suppressive networks permits seizure spread.,"How do brain networks limit seizure activity? In the interictal suppression hypothesis, we recently postulated that high inward connectivity to seizure onset zones (SOZs) from non-involved zones (NIZs) is a sign of broader network suppression. If broad networks appear to be responsible for interictal SOZ suppression, what changes during seizure initiation, spread and termination? For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, intracranial monitoring offers a view into the electrographic networks that organize around and in response to the SOZ. In this manuscript, we investigate network dynamics in the peri-ictal periods to assess possible mechanisms of seizure suppression and the consequences of this suppression being overwhelmed. Peri-ictal network dynamics were derived from stereo electroencephalography recordings from 75 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We computed directed connectivity from 5 s windows in the periods between, immediately before, during and after 668 seizures. We aligned connectivity matrices across seizures and patients, then calculated net connectivity changes from the SOZ, propagative zone and NIZ. Across all seizure types, we observed two phases: a rapid increase in directed communication towards the SOZ, followed by a collapse in network connectivity. During the first phase, SOZs could be distinguished from all other regions (one-way ANOVA, P = 8.32 × 10-19-2.22 × 10-7). In the second phase and post-ictal period, SOZ inward connectivity decreased yet remained distinct (one-way ANOVA, P = 2.58 × 10-10-1.66 × 10-2). NIZs appeared to drive increased SOZ connectivity while intra-NIZ connectivity decreased concordantly. Stratifying by seizure subtype, we found that consciousness-impairing seizures decrease inward connectivity from the NIZ earlier than consciousness-sparing seizures (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01 after false discovery correction). Tracking network reorganization against a surrogate for seizure involvement highlighted a possible antagonism between seizure propagation and the ability of the NIZ to maintain high connectivity to the SOZ. Finally, we found that inclusion of peri-ictal connectivity improved the accuracy of SOZ classification from previous models to a combined area under the curve of 93%. Overall, NIZs appear actively to increase inhibitory signaling towards the SOZ during seizure onset, possibly to thwart seizure activity. Although inhibition appears insufficient to prevent seizure onset, the inability to restrict seizure propagation might contribute to loss of consciousness during larger seizures. Dynamic connectivity patterns uncovered in this work might: (i) facilitate accurate delineation of surgical targets in focal epilepsy; (ii) reveal why interictal suppression of SOZs might be insufficient to prevent all seizures; and (iii) provide insight into mechanisms of loss of consciousness during certain seizures.© The Author(s) 2025.

40533349,Systematic Review of the Predictive Value of Negative Brain or Low Probability Brain MRIs in Patients with CSF-Venous Fistulas.,"Since the discovery of the CSF-venous fistula (CVF), its diagnosis has become more frequent, especially in patients with brain MRIs positive for spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). However, there is a need to understand the likelihood of diagnosis of a CVF in a patient with negative brain imaging.Our aim was to investigate judgment the frequency of CVF in patients suspected of SIH who have negative neuroaxis MRIs.All studies reporting on the incidence of CVF in patients with negative neuroaxis MRIs or low probability scores according to the Bern and Mayo score were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane.Nine studies comprising 898 patients suspected of SIH with 80 CVFs were included.Data were collected on patient demographics, number of patients found to have negative neuroaxis MRIs or low probability scores according to the Bern or Mayo scoring systems, type of imaging used, and number of patients diagnosed with CVF. Analysis was performed by using the standard method for evaluating the negative predictive value (NPV) of a diagnostic test.Of 252 patients found to have negative brain MRIs there were 27 (10.7%) patients with a CVF; there were 15 (18.3%) of 82 patients found to have low probability on the Bern score; and there were 38 (34.8%) of 109 patients found to have low probability on the Mayo score. The NPV of a negative brain MRI was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87) for the Bern score, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.72) for the Mayo score.Our review was limited by heterogeneity of the reference standard and few studies in each subcategory.This review demonstrated that a negative brain MRI is effective in predicting that a patient will not have a CVF, with a high NPV of 89%. However, a patient with a strong clinical suspicion for CSF leak should be considered for more invasive imaging.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40550699,"Pituitary Photon-Counting Detector CT for Cushing Disease: Preoperative Lesion Localization, Intraoperative Findings, and Postoperative Outcomes.","MRI fails to localize a tumor in up to 40% of cases of adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing disease (CD), impacting patient outcomes and creating uncertainty in the diagnosis. Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) is a new CT technology with better imaging performance than conventional CT. PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however, its application to CD remains unknown.We present a cohort of consecutive patients with a preoperative PCD-CT undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for CD at a single institution from September 2023 to January 2025. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced pituitary MRI for baseline work-up and PCD-CT as part of their preoperative planning imaging. Both imaging modalities were used to localize the lesion and guide surgical planning. The accuracies of MRI and PCD-CT were based on confirmation of the lesion location by a combination of intraoperative visualization, pathologic confirmation, and postoperative biochemical remission, and were compared with each other via Fisher exact test.Twenty-five patients with CD were included in this analysis. The cohort's median age was 50 years old, and 88% were women. At diagnosis, 88% had central obesity, 76% had hypertension, 48% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 20% had osteoporosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately identified 56% of lesions, while it was negative in 24% and misleading in 20%. Dynamic contrast-enhanced PCD-CT was superior in localizing CD (P = .01), accurately identifying 92% of lesions, while it was negative in 4% and misleading in 4% of cases. Early postoperative biochemical remission was achieved in 88% of cases, while 84% remained in remission at follow-up.PCD-CT had a high rate of adenoma localization confirmed intraoperatively, even among MR-negative cases, potentially leading to high remission and gland preservation rates. Its role in the clinical workflow of preoperative evaluation for CD requires further investigation, but current evidence supports its value in lesion localization, especially in MR-negative disease.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40550700,Irregular Cervicothoracic Nerve Sheaths on Digital Subtraction Myelography: A CSF-Venous Fistula Mimic.,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) can be caused by CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs), which often require a specialized lateral decubitus examination such as digital subtraction myelography (DSM) for diagnosis. DSM interpretations can be confounded by irregular nerve sheath diverticula at the cervicothoracic junction, potentially mimicking a true CVF. This study aimed to characterize anatomic variations of nerve sheaths at the cervicothoracic junction, in an effort to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.We retrospectively identified 35 patients with low-risk Bern scores who were negative for CVF on DSM. Nerve sheaths at C6-C7, C7-T1, and T1-T2 were classified as normal (<5 mm), elongated linear (≥5 mm), linear-bulbous, linear-branching, or diverticulum. Results were obtained on both the left and right side for each patient.Data were obtained for 34 patients. Among these, 74% (25/34) demonstrated at least 1 variant nerve sheath configuration. The most common site of variation was C7-T1 on the right (seen in 55%, 18/33), and the most frequent morphologic variant overall was an elongated linear sheath (28/198 levels; 40% of all variants).Nerve sheath morphology at the cervicothoracic junction is frequently irregular, and these variants can resemble a CVF on DSM. Recognizing such normal anatomic variations is essential to avoid unwarranted interventions for suspected CVF in patients evaluated for SIH.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40610235,CONSeg: Voxelwise Uncertainty Quantification for Glioma Segmentation Using Conformal Prediction.,"Accurate glioma segmentation has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and treatment planning. Uncertainty quantification methods, including conformal prediction (CP), can enhance segmentation models reliability. CP quantifies uncertainty with statistical confidence guarantees. This study aimed to use CP in glioma segmentation.We used the publicly available University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) glioma data sets, with the UCSF data set (495 cases) split into training (70%), validation (10%), calibration (10%), and test (10%) sets, and the UPenn data set (147 cases) divided into external calibration (30%) and external test (70%) sets. A UNet model was trained, and its optimal threshold was set to 0.5 using prediction normalization. To apply CP, we selected the conformal threshold on the basis of the internal/external calibration nonconformity score, and CP was subsequently applied to the internal/external test sets with coverage. The proportion of true labels within prediction sets was reported for all. We defined the uncertainty ratio (UR) and assessed its correlation with the DSC and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Additionally, we categorized cases into certain and uncertain groups on the basis of UR and compared their DSC and HD95. We also evaluated the correlation between UR and the evaluation metrics (DSC and HD95) of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) fusion model segmentation and compared evaluation metrics in the certain and uncertain subgroups.The base model achieved a DSC of 0.86 and 0.83 and an HD95 of 7.35 and 11.71 on the internal and external test sets, respectively. The CP coverage was 0.9982 for the internal test set and 0.9977 for the external test set. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations between UR and the evaluation metrics for test sets (P value < .001). Additionally, certain cases had significantly better evaluation metrics (higher DSC and lower HD95) than uncertain cases in the test sets and the BraTS fusion model segmentation (P value < .001).CP effectively quantifies uncertainty in glioma segmentation. Using conformal segmentation (CONSeg) improves the reliability of segmentation models and enhances human-computer interactions. Additionally, CONSeg can identify uncertain cases and suggest them for manual segmentation.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40960253,A Randomized Trial of Shunting for Idiopathic Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a neurologic disorder characterized by impaired gait, balance, cognition, and bladder control in older adults. The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of shunting is unclear.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, >400 mm of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence).A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt group (mean [±SD] change, 0.23±0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03±0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P<0.001). A significantly greater improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P = 0.003) but not the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%).Among participants with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or incontinence.

41067911,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Detection of Large Vessel Occlusions on NCCT: A Multi-Institutional Study.,"Imaging triage of stroke patients is primarily based on perfusion imaging. Simplified triage based on non-contrast CT are limited (NCCT). To evaluate the predictive capability of a deep learning algorithm, ""Triage Stroke"" (Brainomix 360) in identifying anterior circulation large vessel occlusions (LVO) on NCCT in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke (AIS).This multi-institutional study analyzed 612 patients with suspected AIS at 3 US comprehensive stroke centers. A balanced cohort of consecutive patients with and without anterior circulation LVO was analyzed. Ground truth was based on concurrent CTA evaluated by site neuroradiologists. The primary outcome was predictive performance for LVO detection. The secondary outcomes were 1) prospective comparison of NCCT LVO detection against general radiologists and subspecialty neuroradiologists, and 2) the influence of NIHSS on the model.Triage Stroke software detected an LVO on NCCT with a 67% sensitivity and 93% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values were 59% and 95%, respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8. The software's sensitivity for LVO detection was significantly higher than the group average of all radiologists (difference = 20.5%; CI, 8.26-32.78; P = .001) and was also higher when separated into general and neuroradiology subgroups. The AUC for NCCT LVO was significantly higher than the group of all readers (difference = 11%; CI, 4%-17%; P < .001), and the nonexpert readers (difference = 13%, CI, 7%-20%; P < .001). The addition of NIHSS to the model yielded a high specificity (99%) and similar sensitivity (65%), resulting in the optimum positive predictive value of all models tested (91%).Triage Stroke software demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for NCCT detection of anterior circulation LVOs outperforming radiologists. Coupled with NIHSS it may simplify identification of endovascular candidates especially in resource-constrained environments worldwide.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41342882,Cell Co-Implantations With Chondrocytes for Cartilage Repair: A Systematic Review of In Vivo Results.,"ObjectivesDamaged articular cartilage cannot regenerate spontaneously. Chondrocyte therapy, the current treatment of choice, requires laboratory expansion, necessitating two surgical procedures. Adding a second cell type to intraoperatively isolated chondrocytes enables single-stage chondrocyte-based repair strategies and has shown promise in vitro. The benefit of this strategy in vivo and in the clinic has not yet been comprehensively assessed. This systematic review assesses the efficacy of cartilage repair by co-implantations of chondrocytes with other cell types over all available in vivo studies.DesignMedline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for studies on co-implantations of chondrocytes with other cell types for hyaline cartilage repair. For each study, extracted data were tabulated and reporting quality and risk of bias were assessed. Studies were categorized based on their control groups for qualitative synthesis.ResultsThe search yielded 48 studies across 46 publications: 44 animal studies (26 ectopic and 18 orthotopic) and four clinical trials. Ectopic studies scored poorly on reporting quality and bias, while orthotopic studies were only moderately better. Twenty-seven of 27 experiments with chondrocyte-only controls demonstrated synergistic cartilage formation through co-implantation. Cartilage formation by co-implantations was also found in 15 of 17 experiments without such control and in four clinical trials.ConclusionCartilage repair by articular chondrocytes is improved by adding a second cell type, like mesenchymal stromal cells. This is likely caused by the second cell types' stimulatory support. Other second cell types and chondrocyte sources have shown promising results too.

41342932,Obstetric and anesthetic management of parturients with intracranial neurovascular abnormalities.,"No definite recommendations exist for anesthetic and obstetric management of pregnant patients with intracranial neurovascular disorders during delivery. This case series describes the management of pregnant patients with intracranial vascular abnormalities during delivery.Information was gathered from institutional databases to include pregnant patients evaluated by neurology or neurosurgery at a single institution between January 2000 and August 2025 for any central nervous system vascular abnormality. Patients were included if evaluation by neurology or neurosurgery occurred either before, during pregnancy, or up to six months post-partum.The study cohort consisted of 26 patients having 31 deliveries. The most common lesions were cavernous malformation (n = 8) and cerebral arteriovenous malformation (n = 8). The remainder had aneurysm (n = 4), dural arteriovenous fistula (n = 2), moyamoya disease (n = 2), venous angioma (n = 1), and carotid dissection (n = 1). Twenty-one deliveries were vaginal and 10 were cesarean delivery (CD). The presence of a neurovascular abnormality was an indication for induction of labor in three individuals and for CD in four deliveries. Neuraxial labor analgesia was used in 14 of the 21 patients who had vaginal delivery. Parturients who underwent CD had spinal anesthesia (n = 8), preexisting labor epidural anesthesia (n = 1), and general anesthesia (n = 1). There were no complications attributed to neuraxial anesthesia.The presence of central nervous system vascular abnormalities in pregnant patients is rare but poses unique challenges to obstetric and anesthetic management. Neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia can be offered to women with central nervous system vascular abnormalities without abnormal neurologic symptoms.© 2025.

Biventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic (ESV) volumes and function during exercise were compared with resting-state real-time cine MRI and conventional cardiac-gated cine MRI under breath holding, and validated against 2D phase-contrast MRI-based estimates of aortic blood flow. Precision was evaluated as the inter-session measurement repeatability.Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV) increased progressively with exercise intensity, which was mediated by a decrease in ESV. Likewise, LV SV estimated with 2D phase-contrast MRI increased from 90 ± 17 mL at rest to 114 ± 29 mL during vigorous-intensity exercise. Repeatability coefficients were 52% and 41% for LV SV at moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise, while RV SV repeatability coefficients were 58% and 42%, respectively.We established an exercise MRI stress testing protocol for quantifying biventricular volumes and function during moderate- and vigorous-intensity steady-state bicycling exercise.© 2025.

41343077,Muscle oxidative capacity does not appear to influence NIRS-VOT outcomes in healthy adults.,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with vascular occlusion testing (VOT) is used to assess skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2) responses. Differences in NIRS-VOT outcomes exist between trained and untrained groups; however, it is unclear whether muscle oxidative capacity is a primary determinant of these differences. Our purpose was to test whether NIRS-VOT outcomes differ between adults with relatively high versus low muscle oxidative capacity, and whether desaturation rates correlate with post-exercise recovery kinetics of muscle oxygen consumption (mV̇O2).Twenty-five adults (12 women) completed assessments of whole-body maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) and vastus lateralis oxidative capacity, as well as a NIRS-VOT. The NIRS-VOT outcomes included downslope, upslope, and maximum StO2 (StO2max). Muscle oxidative capacity (rate constant, k) was quantified following a cycling bout at 50% of peak power at V̇O2max. Participants were divided into two groups based on k values. Independent t-tests and Bayesian estimation were used to compare NIRS-VOT outcomes between the groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient examined the relation between downslope and k.As expected, the high muscle oxidative capacity group showed greater muscle oxidative capacity than the low group (p < 0.01). Independent t-tests revealed no significant (p > 0.05) differences between groups for downslope, upslope, or StO2max. Bayesian analyses supported these findings. No significant (p > 0.05) correlations were found between downslope and k across the total sample or subgroups.Contrary to our hypothesis, muscle oxidative capacity did not appear to yield group differences in NIRS-VOT outcomes. Furthermore, the resting rate of desaturation is unlikely to be a valid indicator of muscle oxidative capacity.© 2025.

41343176,Predictive Role of Circulating Tumor DNA in Stage III Colon Cancer Treated With Celecoxib: A Post Hoc Analysis of the CALGB (Alliance)/SWOG 80702 Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Observational studies have associated use of aspirin and selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors with decreased recurrence and improved survival in patients with colon cancer. While randomized clinical trials have not shown benefit across all patients, these findings suggest that select subgroups may benefit from their use. Despite the well-established prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), its role in guiding treatment remains unclear.To investigate the predictive value of postoperative ctDNA for survival outcomes with adjuvant celecoxib alongside conventional chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer.This was a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (now Alliance)/Southwest Oncology Group 80702 randomized clinical trial (2010-2015) assessing adjuvant celecoxib vs placebo and 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin for stage III colon cancer. Patients consented to biospecimen collection and had ctDNA analysis performed. Data analysis was performed from September 2024 to June 2025.Postoperative ctDNA positivity was determined using a clinically validated, tumor-informed 16-plex-polymerase chain reaction-next-generation sequencing assay (Signatera; Natera Inc) performed between surgery and initiation of adjuvant therapy.Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival by ctDNA status and adjuvant celecoxib use were assessed as part of a post hoc companion study with prespecified statistical analysis plan.Among 940 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.9 [10.8] years; 426 female [45.3%] and 515 male [54.7%] individuals; 222 [23.6%] with prior low-dose aspirin use; and median follow-up of 6.0 [95% CI, 6.0-6.0] years), 767 (81.6%) were ctDNA negative and 173 (18.4%) were ctDNA positive. ctDNA positivity was highly prognostic of worse DFS (reference, ctDNA negativity; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 6.12; 95% CI, 4.66-8.03) and OS (aHR, 5.86; 95% CI, 4.19-8.19). In patients with ctDNA positivity, celecoxib was associated with improved DFS (aHR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89) and OS (aHR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.96) compared to placebo. Among patients with ctDNA negativity, celecoxib did not provide survival benefit (DFS: aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.53-1.09; OS: aHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54-1.36), although the interaction was not significant (P for interaction, .41 and .33 for DFS and OS, respectively). These findings persisted when stratifying patients by microsatellite instability status and PIK3CA mutational status.The findings of this post hoc analysis suggest that ctDNA status has the potential to inform clinical decision-making among patients with stage III colon cancer who should consider adjuvant celecoxib in addition to conventional chemotherapy.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01150045.",JAMA oncology,"Dec 04, 2025",2025,Dec,04,Zhang G Q|Meyerhardt J A|Shi Q|Twombly T|Pederson L|Ma C|Väyrynen J P|Zhao M|Takashima Y|Shergill A|Kumar P|Couture F|Kuebler P|Krishnamurthi S|Tan B|O'Reilly E M|Giannakis M|Ogino S|Jurdi A|Sharma S|Aleshin A|Shields A F|Nowak J A,Shi Q|Pederson L,"Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.|Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Medical Research Center Oulu, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.|Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.|Heartland Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program, Illinois CancerCare, Peoria, Illinois.|Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, Québec City, Québec, Canada.|Columbus National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program, Columbus, Ohio.|Department of Hematology-Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.|Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.|Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Swims were obtained from the Channel Swimming & Piloting Federation database. To minimize variability from noncompetitive crossings, analyses were restricted to the top 100 swimmers of all time within each age and water temperature subgroup. Sex differences were assessed across all finishers, among the top 100 swimmers, within age and water temperature categories, and over consecutive five-year periods. Across all swims, males were 2.2% faster than females (13.54 ± 0.06 hours vs. 13.84 ± 0.10 hours, p = 0.009). Restricting analysis to the top 100 swimmers, the sex difference was 7.2% (9.00 ± 0.08 hours vs. 9.67 ± 0.08 hours, p < 0.001). Sex differences increased with age, ranging from 5.2% in the 20-to-29-year group to 26.5% among swimmers >60-years. Males outperformed females across all water temperature categories, and fastest swims for both sexes were observed at 17-to-17.9 °C. Male swimmers are faster than female swimmers in English Channel crossings, with differences most pronounced among top performers and older athletes. However, sex differences are smaller than those reported in ultra-endurance running, suggesting that the unique environmental and physiological demands of open-water swimming partially attenuate male performance advantages.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Dec 04, 2025",2025,Dec,04,Lacambra L A|Senefeld J W|Joyner M J|Kipp S,Joyner M J|Kipp S,"Carle Illinois College of Medicine, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois.|Department of Health and Kinesiology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois.|Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois.|Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Lacambra L A, Senefeld J W, Joyner M J, Kipp S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41343201/,"The study found that male swimmers are faster than female swimmers in English Channel crossings, with the difference being most pronounced among top performers and older athletes.

41343248,Final Results of the ILLUMINATE-A Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Lumasiran for Primary Hyperoxaluria 1.,"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is characterized by hepatic oxalate overproduction, kidney stones, and progressive kidney disease. Lumasiran is the first approved treatment for PH1.ILLUMINATE-A (NCT03681184) was a 60-month pivotal, phase 3, multinational clinical trial of lumasiran which consisted of a six-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period (6M DB) followed by a treatment extension period of up to 54 months in which all patients received lumasiran. Eligible patients were aged ≥6 years with genetically confirmed PH1, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2, and mean 24-hour urinary oxalate (UOx) excretion ≥0.70 mmol/24h/1.73m2.Of 39 patients enrolled, 24 out of 26 randomized to lumasiran in the 6M DB (lumasiran/lumasiran group) and 13 out of 13 randomized to placebo in the 6M DB (placebo/lumasiran group) completed the study. Sustained reductions in 24-hour UOx were observed in both treatment groups. At Month 60 relative to study baseline, mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) 24-hour UOx percentage reductions were 54% (6%) and 54% (8%) in the lumasiran/lumasiran and placebo/lumasiran groups, respectively, and mean (SEM) plasma oxalate concentrations had decreased by 35% (5%) and 38% (7%). Estimated glomerular filtration rate remained stable through the end of the study in both treatment groups. Kidney stone event rates during the study were 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36, 0.62) and 0.54 (0.37, 0.78) per patient-year in the lumasiran/lumasiran group and placebo/lumasiran group, respectively. Medullary nephrocalcinosis grade improved at the end of the study in 21 out of 28 (75%) patients with nephrocalcinosis at baseline and an end of study assessment. The safety profile of lumasiran was acceptable. Injection site reactions were the most common adverse events during lumasiran treatment. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.Lumasiran treatment for up to 60 months in ILLUMINATE-A was associated with sustained reductions in UOx excretion and plasma oxalate concentration, and encouraging clinical outcomes including stable eGFR in a population that would be expected to show eGFR decline, reduced kidney stone event rates, improved medullary nephrocalcinosis, and indications of improved quality of life.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41343363,2025 Clinical Practice Guideline Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Pharyngitis: Risk assessment using clinical scoring systems in children and adults.,"This publication represents the first part of an update to the clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes or GAS) pharyngitis, developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis by clinician judgement alone is unreliable, and unselective testing incurs cost and inconvenience for individuals at low risk of having GAS infection. Clinical scoring systems have been used to quantify the probability of a positive GAS throat culture based on standardized criteria such as the presence of fever; tonsillar enlargement or exudate; tender and enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes; and the absence of cough. The goal of this paper is to determine whether a scoring system should be used to decide which patients should have a diagnostic test performed by rapid antigen detection test (RADT), molecular methods, and/or throat culture. We performed a systematic review of randomized and non-randomized studies that compared the use of a clinical scoring system to clinician judgement alone in predicting the outcome of a throat culture. Evidence from studies in children and adults suggests the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical scoring system is comparable to or slightly higher than clinician judgement alone. However, the studies are limited due to small size, lack of uniformity in outcome measures, and incomplete data. The consensus of the panel is that the balance of benefits and harms favors use of a clinical scoring system as part of the evaluation of patients with sore throat. The principal utility of using a scoring system is to identify patients with low probability of GAS pharyngitis and to reduce unnecessary testing.© The Author(s) 2025.

41344863,Penile augmentation and cosmetic surgery: recommendations from the Fifth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2024).,"Penile augmentation or penis enlargement surgery refers to any technique aimed at enhancing penile length or girth. These male enhancement surgical techniques can increase total penile length, either flaccid or erect, while others add to the penile shaft's girth and/or glans size. Proposed strategies include physical methods such as various penile exercises, mechanical traction devices, and medical therapy, while surgical interventions include cosmetic and phallic reconstructive techniques and use of fillers, sleeves, grafts, and flaps to augment penile size.The International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM) consensus statements provide evidence-based recommendations and aim to guide a clinical framework in penile aesthetic and augmentation.A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify published literature relevant to penile augmentation or enhancement. Preliminary consensus was presented to the delegates attending the 5th ICSM meeting, and feedback was incorporated into the final document.Twenty new recommendations are provided with corresponding levels of evidence and grades of recommendation.Due to the controversies and lack of longer-term data regarding penile augmentation and cosmetic procedures, comprehensive assessments and careful patient counseling weighing the pros and cons, as well as potential complications, are mandatory before embarking on any treatment. Surgeons should be experienced in anatomy and various surgical techniques, and it is important to individualize surgical options based on patient condition(s) and needs, surgeon expertise, and local resources.© The Author(s) 2025.

41345095,Final OS analyses from the TOURMALINE- MM3 and -MM4 RCTs of ixazomib maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.,"TOURMALINE-MM3 (NCT02181413) and -MM4 (NCT02312258) were phase 3 studies of fixed-duration, single-agent ixazomib maintenance in post-transplant (TOURMALINE-MM3)/transplant-ineligible (TOURMALINE-MM4) patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) that demonstrated improved median progression-free survival (PFS) for ixazomib vs placebo. We present the final overall survival (OS) analyses for each study separately. In both studies, eligible patients were randomized 3:2 to receive ixazomib maintenance (3 mg [cycles 1-4], 4 mg [from cycle 5 if tolerated]) or matching placebo for ≤26 cycles, or until progressive disease/unacceptable toxicity. At median follow-up of approximately 8 years (TOURMALINE-MM3) and 5 years (TOURMALINE-MM4), median OS was not reached in either arm in MM3 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.025; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.789-1.332; p = 0.850), and was 64.8 (ixazomib) vs 69.5 (placebo) months in MM4 (HR, 1.090; 95% CI, 0.861-1.381; p = 0.473). No new safety signals were identified in either study; incidence of new primary malignancies was low. Despite meeting their primary endpoints (PFS), neither final OS analysis of TOURMALINE-MM3/-MM4 showed statistically significant differences between fixed-duration ixazomib maintenance and placebo in patients with NDMM. The growing number of available, highly effective salvage treatments with novel mechanisms of action make demonstrating an OS advantage in front-line myeloma studies increasingly challenging.© 2025.

39880412,Global estimates of prevalence of chronic painful neuropathy and moderate-to-severe neuropathy among patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 29 countries between 2000 and 2024.,"Although the prevalence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has been reported, the proportion of patients with CIPN who report chronic moderate-to-severe neuropathy or chronic painful neuropathy remains poorly understood, despite its significant impact on patients' quality of life and treatment outcomes.A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of chronic (≥3 months) moderate-to-severe CIPN or painful CIPN among patients diagnosed with CIPN. Estimates from each study were transformed using a double-arcsine transformation and pooled in a meta-analysis using an inverse variance heterogeneity model. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on geographical region, sex, chemotherapy regimen, primary cancer type, and funding source; metaregression analysis was conducted based on study design, human development index (HDI), and publication year.76 studies from 29 countries, encompassing 13 635 patients with CIPN, were included. Among patients diagnosed with CIPN, the pooled prevalence of those reporting chronic moderate-to-severe CIPN or painful CIPN was estimated at 47.76% (95% CI 37.50 to 58.08; 95% prediction interval 24.68-71.84). Substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I²=97.45%; 95% CI for I 2 97.15 to 97.72). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients treated with platinum-based agents and taxanes had the highest prevalence of chronic moderate-to-severe CIPN or painful CIPN (44.47% and 55.68%, respectively), and among primary cancers, those with breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and lung cancer reported the highest prevalence of chronic moderate-to-severe CIPN or painful CIPN (61.31%, 53.55%, and 50.85%, respectively). Study design, HDI, and publication year were non-significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Based on our Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation assessment, the certainty of evidence was considered ""very low."" Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies explicitly measuring painful CIPN (40.78%; 95% CI 29.08 to 52.74) or moderate-to-severe CIPN (49.04%; 95% CI 37.16 to 60.95) yielded similar prevalence estimates.This study provides the first comprehensive global estimate of the prevalence of chronic moderate-to-severe CIPN or painful CIPN, highlighting its significant burden on patients worldwide.

41343478,A multi-agent approach to neurological clinical reasoning.,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in medical domains, yet their ability to handle the specialized reasoning patterns required in clinical neurology warrants systematic evaluation. Neurological assessment presents distinctive challenges that combine anatomical localization, temporal pattern recognition, and nuanced symptom interpretation-cognitive processes that are specifically tested in board certification examinations. We developed a comprehensive benchmark comprising 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology and classified each along three dimensions of complexity: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs of varying architectures and specializations using this benchmark, testing base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhancement, and a novel multi-agent system. Our analysis revealed significant performance variation across models and methodologies. The OpenAI-o1 model achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed surprisingly poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG enhancement provided variable benefits across models; substantial improvements for mid-tier models like GPT-4o (80.5% to 87.3%) and smaller models, but limited effectiveness on the highest complexity questions regardless of model size. In contrast, our multi-agent framework-which decomposes neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation-achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy compared to 69.5% for its base model, with particularly substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions across all dimensions. External validation on MedQA revealed dataset-specific RAG effects: while RAG improved board certification performance, it showed minimal benefit on MedQA questions (LLaMA 3.3-70B: + 1.4% vs + 3.9% on board exams), reflecting alignment between our specialized neurology textbook and board examination content rather than the broader medical knowledge required for MedQA. Most notably, the multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into remarkably uniform excellence, effectively addressing the neurological reasoning challenges that persisted even with RAG enhancement. We further validated our approach using an independent dataset comprising 155 neurological cases extracted from MedQA. The results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.Copyright: © 2025 Sorka et al.

41343524,Enhancing the emergency department experience for older adults: Study protocol for the implementation of a comfort menu and cart.,"The aging of the population is a global phenomenon, with projections indicating a significant increase in the proportion of individuals aged 65 years and older by 2050. This demographic shift requires adapting emergency department (ED) services to meet the specific demands of older patients, who often present with multiple comorbidities and face challenges such as sensory and cognitive difficulties. EDs, traditionally designed for acute illness and injury management, may not be adequately equipped to meet the unique needs of this vulnerable population. This can result in suboptimal patient experiences, prolonged ED stays, increased hospitalizations, and poorer outcomes.This study protocol outlines a before-and-after study to evaluate the impact of implementing a comfort menu and cart on the experience and outcomes of older patients treated in the ED. The study will be conducted in the ED of Hospital Sírio-Libanês (HSL), a tertiary private hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged 65 and older who presented to the ED will be eligible for inclusion. Participants will be recruited in two phases: pre-intervention and post-implementation of the comfort menu and cart. Data will be collected through patient and staff interviews, chart reviews, and a 30-day follow-up interview. Patient experience, staff experience, length of hospital stays, hospital costs, ED readmissions, falls, delirium incidence, quality of life, functional status, cognitive performance, and mortality will be assessed.We expect to demonstrate the positive impact of implementing the comfort menu and cart in the ED on patient-centered outcomes. We anticipate improvements in the experience of older patients and medical and multidisciplinary staff, and hope to identify improvements in other exploratory outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06681376.Copyright: © 2025 Ferreira et al.
