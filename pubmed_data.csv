41298658,Elevated Lactobacillus salivarius and genus Akkermansia in fecal samples of Taiwanese patients with parkinson's disease and diabetes mellitus.,"Recent advancements in non-invasive collection methods and technological innovations have significantly enhanced the analysis of human gut microbiota, which has become a key approach for understanding complex disease pathogenesis. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have revealed intriguing connections between Parkinson's disease (PD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, microbial populations from fecal samples of patients with PD and DM were analyzed. The prospective cohorts included four groups: PD only (n = 32), DM only (n = 170), and concurrent PD and DM (n = 10), matched with healthy controls (n = 98) by age and comorbidities. Fecal samples underwent full-length (V1-V9) 16 S rRNA sequencing analysis, and clinical and laboratory variables were collected. The results revealed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus salivarius in patients with PD (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] = 2.58, p value < 0.05) or DM (LDA = 2.20) compared to healthy controls. Similarly, an elevated abundance of the genus Akkermansia was observed in patients with PD (LDA = 4.39) or DM (LDA = 3.92). These findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations, particularly involving L. salivarius and Akkermansia spp., may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD and DM, warranting further investigation into their significance.© 2025.

41298261,Health impact of alcohol use in the USA: a protocol of a systematic review and modelling study.,"Alcohol is consumed by an estimated 137.4 million people in the USA 12 years of age and older and, as a result, is estimated to have caused about 140 thousand deaths among people 20 to 64 years of age each year from 2015 up to and including 2019.The proposed review of the evidence on alcohol's impact on health aims to produce conclusions to inform the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2026-2030. A multi-method approach will be utilised to formulate conclusions on (i) weekly (ie, average) thresholds to minimise long-term and short-term risks of morbidity and mortality, (ii) daily thresholds to minimise the short-term risk of injury or acute illness due to per occasion drinking, (iii) alcohol use among vulnerable populations (eg, pregnant women) and (iv) situations and circumstances that are hazardous for alcohol use. To inform expert decisions, this project will also include a systematic review of existing low-risk drinking guidelines, a systematic review of meta-analyses which examine alcohol's impact on key attributable disease and mortality outcomes, and of estimates of the lifetime absolute risk of alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity based on a person's sex and average level of alcohol use. The systematic reviews were designed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P). The preliminary conclusions produced as a result of this project will undergo public consultation, and data from these consultations will be qualitatively analysed. The results of the public consultations will be used to further revise and refine the project's conclusions.The study was granted an ethics exemption as only secondary data sources and unidentifiable public consultation will be utilised. Systematic reviews are pre-registered with PROSPERO (registration numbers CRD42024584924 and CRD42024584948).This project will establish a scientific consensus concerning alcohol's impact on health. This consensus is imperative for informing the upcoming Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2026-2030, and for better informing individuals about the health risks associated with alcohol use.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

40533349,Systematic Review of the Predictive Value of Negative Brain or Low Probability Brain MRIs in Patients with CSF-Venous Fistulas.,"Since the discovery of the CSF-venous fistula (CVF), its diagnosis has become more frequent, especially in patients with brain MRIs positive for spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). However, there is a need to understand the likelihood of diagnosis of a CVF in a patient with negative brain imaging.Our aim was to investigate judgment the frequency of CVF in patients suspected of SIH who have negative neuroaxis MRIs.All studies reporting on the incidence of CVF in patients with negative neuroaxis MRIs or low probability scores according to the Bern and Mayo score were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane.Nine studies comprising 898 patients suspected of SIH with 80 CVFs were included.Data were collected on patient demographics, number of patients found to have negative neuroaxis MRIs or low probability scores according to the Bern or Mayo scoring systems, type of imaging used, and number of patients diagnosed with CVF. Analysis was performed by using the standard method for evaluating the negative predictive value (NPV) of a diagnostic test.Of 252 patients found to have negative brain MRIs there were 27 (10.7%) patients with a CVF; there were 15 (18.3%) of 82 patients found to have low probability on the Bern score; and there were 38 (34.8%) of 109 patients found to have low probability on the Mayo score. The NPV of a negative brain MRI was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87) for the Bern score, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.72) for the Mayo score.Our review was limited by heterogeneity of the reference standard and few studies in each subcategory.This review demonstrated that a negative brain MRI is effective in predicting that a patient will not have a CVF, with a high NPV of 89%. However, a patient with a strong clinical suspicion for CSF leak should be considered for more invasive imaging.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40577236,Clinical phenotypes and renal outcomes in PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy: a multi-center cohort study with unsupervised cluster analysis.,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) associated with phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in non-diabetic adult patients. This study investigated the relationship between clinical phenotypes and renal outcomes in this population, emphasizing the potential for phenotype-based treatment stratification.We conducted a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of PLA2R-positive MN. Unsupervised cluster analysis grouped patients based on clinicopathological characteristics. Primary outcomes included complete or partial remission within 2 years of biopsy and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death during follow-up.Among 178 patients, three distinct clusters emerged (n = 89, 70, and 19). Within 2 years of biopsy, 102 patients (57%) achieved complete or partial remission. Cluster 1, characterized by the mildest disease markers, including the lowest body mass index, serum anti-PLA2R titer, serum creatinine, proteinuria, and triglycerides, had the highest remission rate of 72%, compared with 50% in cluster 2 and 54% in cluster 3. Cluster 2 had significantly lower remission compared to cluster 1 (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96, P = .03); results were similar in cluster 3, albeit not statistically significant (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23-1.09, P = .08). Elevated anti-PLA2R levels (>100 U/ml) and proteinuria (>8 g/24-hour) predicted reduced remission (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.88, P = .01; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26-0.73, P = .002, respectively), while high high-density lipoprotein levels were protective (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, P = .048). Overall, 21 patients (12%) developed ESKD or died. ESKD-free survival differed significantly across clusters (log-rank test P = .04).Unsupervised clustering identified distinct clinical phenotypes in PLA2R-positive MN, each associated with different renal prognoses. Phenotype-based risk stratification could enhance treatment precision, improve patient outcomes, and potentially reduce treatment-related adverse effects.© The Author(s) 2025.

40610235,CONSeg: Voxelwise Uncertainty Quantification for Glioma Segmentation Using Conformal Prediction.,"Accurate glioma segmentation has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and treatment planning. Uncertainty quantification methods, including conformal prediction (CP), can enhance segmentation models reliability. CP quantifies uncertainty with statistical confidence guarantees. This study aimed to use CP in glioma segmentation.We used the publicly available University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) glioma data sets, with the UCSF data set (495 cases) split into training (70%), validation (10%), calibration (10%), and test (10%) sets, and the UPenn data set (147 cases) divided into external calibration (30%) and external test (70%) sets. A UNet model was trained, and its optimal threshold was set to 0.5 using prediction normalization. To apply CP, we selected the conformal threshold on the basis of the internal/external calibration nonconformity score, and CP was subsequently applied to the internal/external test sets with coverage. The proportion of true labels within prediction sets was reported for all. We defined the uncertainty ratio (UR) and assessed its correlation with the DSC and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Additionally, we categorized cases into certain and uncertain groups on the basis of UR and compared their DSC and HD95. We also evaluated the correlation between UR and the evaluation metrics (DSC and HD95) of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) fusion model segmentation and compared evaluation metrics in the certain and uncertain subgroups.The base model achieved a DSC of 0.86 and 0.83 and an HD95 of 7.35 and 11.71 on the internal and external test sets, respectively. The CP coverage was 0.9982 for the internal test set and 0.9977 for the external test set. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations between UR and the evaluation metrics for test sets (P value < .001). Additionally, certain cases had significantly better evaluation metrics (higher DSC and lower HD95) than uncertain cases in the test sets and the BraTS fusion model segmentation (P value < .001).CP effectively quantifies uncertainty in glioma segmentation. Using conformal segmentation (CONSeg) improves the reliability of segmentation models and enhances human-computer interactions. Additionally, CONSeg can identify uncertain cases and suggest them for manual segmentation.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40622999,Sex-specific clinical presentations and outcomes in ANCA-associated vasculitis presenting with severe kidney disease.,"The impact of sex in the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) with glomerulonephritis (AAV-GN) has not been studied, particularly in patients with severe kidney involvement at presentation (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2).A retrospective cohort study on MPO- or PR3-ANCA positive patients with AAV (MPA or GPA) and eGFR<15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) at presentation. Clinical presentation and renal outcomes were analyzed according to sex.We analyzed 166 patients with biopsy-proven active AAV-GN and eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.7 3m2 at the time of diagnosis: 78 (47%) were females and 88 (53%) were males. Hypertension was more frequently present in males (85.2% vs 70.5%, P = .022). Median serum creatinine (SCr) was higher in males when compared with females [5.2 (IQR 4.2-7.4) vs 3.6 (IQR 2.8-5.1) mg/dl, P < .001]. Males started dialysis within 4 weeks more frequently than female (p = .003) although the median percentage of crescents was similar between groups (35.7% in males versus 36.4% in females, P = .0873). However, the rate of dialysis initiation or progression to ESKD in the first 12 months was not different between males (15, 62.5%) versus females (29, 61.7%) at 12 months. By multivariable logistic regression, factors related with dialysis initiation within the first 4 weeks in our cohort were SCr, alveolar hemorrhage, and PR3-ANCA adjusted for sex.In our cohort, male patients presented with higher serum creatinine (SCr), and dialysis was started within the first 4 weeks more frequently (53.4% vs 30.7%). There were no differences in outcomes of kidney recovery, overall dialysis rates, and progression to ESKD within 12 months in patients with AAV-GN and eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 between groups.© The Author(s) 2025.

40833223,"Physician-in-the-Loop Active Learning in Radiology Artificial Intelligence Workflows: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is being explored for a growing range of applications in radiology, including image reconstruction, image segmentation, synthetic image generation, disease classification, worklist triage, and examination scheduling. However, training accurate AI models typically requires substantial amounts of expert-labeled data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Active learning offers a potential strategy for mitigating the impacts of such labeling requirements. In contrast with other machine learning approaches used for data-limited situations, active learning aims to produce labeled datasets by identifying the most informative or uncertain data for human annotation, thereby reducing labeling burden to improve model performance under constrained datasets. This Review explores the application of active learning to radiology AI, focusing on the role of active learning in reducing the resources needed to train radiology AI models while enhancing physician-AI interaction and collaboration. We discuss how active learning can be incorporated into radiology workflows to promote physician-in-the-loop AI systems, presenting key active learning concepts and use cases for radiology-based tasks, including through literature-based examples.

41237417,Ultrasound urodynamic studies (US-UDS): noninvasive estimation of detrusor pressure through ultrasound.,"Objective.Urodynamic studies (UDSs) are vital for evaluating bladder function but require invasive catheterization to measure detrusor pressure (Pdet). Our purpose is to report on technical developments toward a noninvasive and accurate estimation ofPdetthrough ultrasound (US), a technique we refer to as US-UDS.Approach.The proposed US-UDS technique produces an estimate ofPdetby using US to induce and track elastic waves that propagate within and around the bladder wall. Key components of the US-UDS processing include: an US sequence with dense time sampling; an empirical correction accounting for deviation from a Lamb wave dispersion model; and constrained optimization forPdetestimation. US-UDS analysis for estimation ofPdetwas applied to 533 distinct data points collected from 3 human subjects undergoing concurrent UDS. Concordance analysis was used to evaluate agreement between US-UDS and UDS measures ofPdetwhile response operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate US-UDS for detection of detrusor activity (parameterized as UDSPdet>15 cmH2O).Main results.US-UDS was able estimatePdetwithin 10 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O of UDS measurements with coverage probabilities of 95.7% and 68.8% respectively. Furthermore, US-UDS was able to detect UDSPdetmeasurements greater than 15 cmH2O with a sensitivities and specificities of 0.99 and 0.83 using a fixed threshold (>15 cmH2O for US-UDS) and 1.0 and 0.93 for an optimized threshold (> 11.08 cmH2O for US-UDS).Significance.Our results show that the technical developments of US-UDS put forth in this work are able produce accurate and useful estimates ofPdetas compared to traditional UDS. Although additional research with a large number of subjects is needed to fully characterize the clinical utility of US-UDS, the developments and results from this work demonstrate that clinically useful non-invasive measurements ofPdetare feasible from US measurements.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Physics in medicine and biology,"Nov 26, 2025",2025,Nov,26,Rosen D P|Linder B J|Alizad A|Fatemi M,Rosen D P|Linder B J|Alizad A|Fatemi M,"Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Collage of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, United States of America.|Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic Collage of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, United States of America.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Collage of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, United States of America.","Rosen D P, Linder B J, Alizad A, Fatemi M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237417/,"The study presents a new ultrasound-based technique called US-UDS that can estimate bladder pressure non-invasively, without the need for invasive catheterization.

41291327,"Lorlatinib and neurocognitive adverse events: characterization, risk factors, and the potentially mitigative role of social support.","Lorlatinib is the preferred first-line treatment for patients with ALK+ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, this drug carries high rates of neurocognitive adverse events. This study further characterized these neurocognitive adverse events, examined risk factors, and, for the first time, explored social support as a mitigation strategy.The Mayo Clinic medical record was interrogated for patients prescribed lorlatinib between July 2017 and May 2022, and medical records were reviewed in detail.Sixty-three patients were prescribed lorlatinib (median age: 59 years (range: 37-82); 31 (49%) men). Twenty-five (40%) developed a neurocognitive adverse event, which had been characterized as follows: ""hallucinations,"" ""noise confusion,"" ""obtunded,"" ""memory loss,"" ""trouble doing simple tasks,"" ""mental fogginess,"" ""vivid dreams,"" and ""nightmares."" In univariable analyses, age, gender, prior brain metastases, concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors, and married/partner status were not statistically significantly predictive of the neurocognitive adverse event. In multivariable analyses, older age (≥ 65 years) was predictive (HR: 2.6 (95% CI: 1.09, 6.26); p = 0.03). Notably, 3 of 14 married/partnered patients (21%) and 5 of 6 non-married/partnered patients (83%) were hospitalized for a neurocognitive adverse event (p = 0.02, Fisher's Exact test).

41293926,FSTL1 Orchestrates Metabolic-Epigenetic Crosstalk: Glycolysis-Dependent H3K18 Lactylation Drives Cartilage Fibrosis in Osteoarthritis.,"The progression of osteoarthritis (OA) is fundamentally characterized by the aberrant transformation of chondrocytes into a fibrotic phenotype, although the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain inadequately understood. In this study, the interplay between epigenetic modifications and metabolic reprogramming during the activation of fibrocartilage cells in osteoarthritis was investigated. The findings demonstrate that FSTL1 markedly upregulates key glycolytic enzymes, including LDHA, HK2, and PKM, in chondrocytes, triggering a ""glycolytic burst"" that results in elevated intracellular lactate levels. This accumulated lactate acts as a precursor for epigenetic modifications, specifically promoting the lactylation of histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18la) in fibrocartilage cells, thereby facilitating the transcriptional activation of critical fibrosis-related genes such as Itga6, Cxcl10, and Parp16. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway or lactate dehydrogenase significantly diminishes H3K18la levels and markers of chondrocyte fibrosis, while exogenous lactate supplementation can counteract this effect. In summary, this study unveils the core mechanism by which FSTL1 reshapes the epigenetic landscape of chondrocytes and drives the fibrotic process through the activation of the ""glycolysis-lactate-H3K18la"" cascade axis, offering a dual-target intervention strategy for OA involving metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modification.© 2025 The Author(s).

41293991,"Distinct clinical, laboratory, molecular, and pathologic features of systemic mastocytosis involving the gastrointestinal tract.","Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in systemic mastocytosis (SM). We hereby report the clinicopathologic and molecular features of GI mastocytosis.The study includes 104 patients with suspected SM. Of 258 GI biopsy -specimens, 33 (20 patients, 19%) were mastocytosis-positive, with 19 (16 patients) initially missed.Tryptase (n = 29) was weakly positive/negative in two-thirds of the mastocytosis-positive GI biopsy specimens. Additional immunohistochemistry (n = 23) showed positive mast cell expression for CD30 (n = 2), CD123 (n = 7), and PD-L1 (n = 12), as well as increased PD-1-positive cells (n = 4). Sixty patients had positive bone marrow (BM) for SM (SM-BM+), including 19 with positive GI biopsy specimens (SM-GI+). Almost all (43/44) SM-BM- patients were SM-GI-. The SM-GI vs SM-BM status showed high positive predictive value (95%) and specificity (98%). Patients with SM with mastocytosis-positive vs mastocytosis-negative GI biopsy specimens had higher serum tryptase levels (P = .04). KIT D816V mutation was detected in 7 of 13 and 12 of 13 mastocytosis-positive GI biopsy specimens using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), respectively.GI mastocytosis is highly predictive of SM in BM; however, most SM-BM+ patients are SM-GI-. The SM-BM- patients are very unlikely to be SM-GI+. Because GI neoplastic mast cells are often tryptase negative, diagnostic evaluation should include CD117 and CD25 immunohistochemistry, as well as KIT D816V mutation analysis by ddPCR as needed.© The Author(s) 2025.

41294120,Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of High-Sensitivity Troponin T for Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy.,"Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are associated with adverse cardiac events. Although troponin elevation is a diagnostic criterion for ICI-related myocarditis (ICIrM) and myocardial infarction, data on other causes of troponin elevation and their outcomes in ICI-treated patients are limited.All patients treated with ICI who had hs-TnT (high-sensitivity troponin T) measured at a multicenter institution from 2011 to 2022 were included. Clinical data, outcomes (cardiac death, heart failure (HF), major adverse cardiovascular events [myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure]), and cause of hs-TnT elevation were assessed. Risks of cardiac events were compared across hs-TnT elevation causes.Of 5423 patients treated with ICI, 1669 had post-ICI hs-TnT measurement (mean age 68.7±11.3 years, 58.3% male), with 1-year follow-up. Hs-TnT elevation in patients with ICIrM (n=59) was associated with the highest risk for cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR], 52.7 [95% CI, 11.7-238.0], P<0.001), followed by hs-TnT elevation due to heart failure (HR, 15.9), myocardial infarction/type 2 ischemia (HR, 11.6), and infection/sepsis (HR, 5.7), compared with those with no hs-TnT elevation. ICIrM also carried highest risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 8.2, [95% CI, 4.4-15.3], P<0.001), followed by myocardial infarction/type 2 ischemia (HR, 8.1), heart failure (HR, 7.6), pulmonary embolus (HR, 5.1), infection/sepsis (HR, 4.1), and indeterminate cause (HR, 2.4). Among ICIrM, HsTnT value >576 ng/L best predicted risk for cardiac death and >319 ng/L for major adverse cardiovascular events.Hs-TnT elevation after ICI therapy is associated with increased risk of cardiac events, particularly in ICIrM, and a graded prognostic association depending on the cause of hs-TnT elevation.

41295906,Developing Global Gastrointestinal Care Capacity: Lessons Learned From a New GI Partnership Care Delivery Model in Rwanda.,"Describe the establishment and expansion of a global gastrointestinal (GI) partnership and its impact on the advancement of GI care in Rwanda.GI disease disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries. In Rwanda, governmental and nonprofit efforts have made significant progress in expanding access to health care in the wake of the 1994 genocide; however, specialized care remains largely unrecognized or inaccessible. In response, the Rwanda Ministry of Health established a partnership with an international gastroenterology NGO to address this critical need.We present summative data generated by this partnership. To inform future global GI programs, we provide lessons learned and details about Rwanda's successful establishment of an in-country, self-sustainable, and locally governed gastroenterology training program.From 2017 to 2023, the partnership expanded the number of clinical sites receiving care from 4 to 11. Total procedural volume increased from 244 to 1069. Most common presenting upper GI symptoms included dyspepsia, reflux, and emesis, while most common lower GI symptoms included hematochezia and constipation. Since 2017, this partnership has increased the number of faculty volunteering in Rwanda (and Rwandan clinicians studying in US academic medical centers), expanded its geographical reach, assisted in the creation of a GI fellowship, and enabled Rwanda to become an East African hub for medical education.Lessons learned across ethical, financial, leadership, cultural, and medical domains from the successful establishment and expansion of an international GI partnership in Rwanda provides invaluable insights to guide development of future models of health care in emerging economies.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41295997,Risk of bleeding after esophagogastroduodenoscopy with mucosal resection in patients with cirrhosis.,"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is commonly used for evaluating and managing gastrointestinal lesions. This study aimed to assess the 30-day risk of bleeding and other adverse outcomes following EGD-EMR in cirrhotic patients.This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the US Collaborative Network to evaluate bleeding risk following EGD-EMR in cirrhotic patients. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed, with the primary outcome being bleeding within 30 days post-procedure.Each cohort included 1,045 patients. Cirrhotic patients had higher risk of post-EGD-EMR bleeding (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.21-2.25, P = 0.002) and were more likely to require a blood transfusion (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21-5.31, P = 0.011). However, ICU admissions (OR 1.33, P = 0.29) and endoscopic reinterventions (OR 1.31, P = 0.25) did not differ significantly. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis had a higher bleeding risk compared to controls (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.05-2.51, P = 0.03), while those with compensated cirrhosis showed no increased risk (OR 1.16, P = 0.55).This study found increased post-procedural bleeding in cirrhotic patients, particularly those with decompensated cirrhosis.

Based on this feedback, detailed morphologic definitions for lesions and guidance statements that standardize lesion assessments were formulated and presented for consensus voting in 2 electronic Delphi surveys. A virtual group discussion after round 1 supported participants in round 2 voting.Response rates were 84.7% (50 of 59), 86.0% (43 of 50), and 90.9% (40 of 44) in the preliminary, electronic Delphi round 1, and electronic Delphi round 2 surveys, respectively. Morphological definitions for 11 lesion types achieved the prespecified 70% consensus threshold, with 9 definitions reaching at least 90% agreement. After 2 electronic Delphi rounds, 16 of 18 guidance statements achieved the prespecified consensus threshold, with 13 statements receiving endorsement from more than 80% of participants.

41296369,Metastatic Recurrence Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer.,"Despite treatment advances, metastatic recurrence continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Empirical data on the incidence and survival after metastatic recurrence remain limited, as cancer registries historically do not collect data on recurrence.To estimate the cumulative incidence (CMI) of metastatic recurrence among adolescents and young adults diagnosed with earlier-stage disease and compare survival to those with metastatic disease at diagnosis.This was a retrospective cohort study of adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39 years who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic cancers from 2006 to 2018. Adolescents and young adults were identified from the California Cancer Registry linked with statewide hospitalization, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery encounters from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to June 2025.Cancer types, including melanoma, sarcoma, and breast, cervical, colorectal, testicular, and thyroid cancers.Metastatic recurrence was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, metastatic disease codes at least 6 months after cancer diagnosis or from an underlying cancer cause of death. Follow-up was through December 31, 2020.Of a total of 48 406 adolescents and young adults (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 33.0 [28.0-37.0] years; 67.4% female), 9.2% had metastatic disease at diagnosis, and 9.5% had metastatic recurrence. Among 43 935 adolescents and young adults who presented with nonmetastatic disease, the 5-year CMI of metastatic recurrences was highest among patients with sarcoma (24.5%; 95% CI, 22.6%-26.6%) and colorectal cancer (21.8%; 95% CI, 20.3%-23.4%) and intermediate for cervical (16.3%; 95% CI, 15.0%-17.6%) and breast (14.7%; 95% CI, 14.0%-15.4%) cancers. The CMI for metastatic recurrence increased with increasing stage at diagnosis, with 5-year CMIs higher than 30% for all stage III cancers (except thyroid). The 5-year CMI of metastatic recurrence also increased over time for cervical cancer (2006-2009: 12.7% [95% CI, 10.8%-14.8%]; 2015-2018: 20.4% [95% CI, 17.5%-23.6%]) and decreased for colorectal cancer (2006-2009: 24.4% [95% CI, 21.3%-27.6%]; 2015-2018: 19.2% [95% CI, 16.4%-22.2%]). Survival after metastatic recurrence was worse than metastatic disease at diagnosis for all cancer types, except for testicular and thyroid cancers.The findings from this cohort study highlight the overall burden of metastatic disease in adolescents and young adults, expanding the knowledge of metastatic recurrences that help improve care for adolescent and young adult survivors throughout the cancer survivorship spectrum.",JAMA oncology,"Nov 26, 2025",2025,Nov,26,Brunson A|Wun T|Abrahão R|Quesenberry C P|Chubak J|Ruddy K J|Chao C R|Hahn E E|Sauder C A M|Nichols H B|Kushi L H|Keegan T H M,Ruddy K J,"Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento.|Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Pleasanton.|Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle.|Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena.|Department of Health Systems Science, Kaiser Permanente Bernard J.

41297801,The chromatin regulator HELLS mediates SSB repair and responses to DNA alkylation damage.,"The SNF2 family chromatin remodeler HELLS has emerged as an important regulator of cell proliferation, genome stability, and several cancer pathways. Significant upregulation of HELLS has been reported in 33 human cancer types. While HELLS has been implicated in DNA damage response, its function in DNA repair is poorly understood. Here, we report a new regulatory link between HELLS and single-strand break (SSB) repair in cellular responses to DNA alkylation damage. We found that loss of HELLS impairs SSB repair and selectively sensitizes cells to DNA alkylating agents and PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Our data reveal non-epistatic interactions between HELLS and PARP1 and suggest that HELLS functionally compensates for PARP1 deficiency in promoting cell survival in response to DNA alkylation damage. Furthermore, we found that HELLS is co-expressed with PARP1 in cancer cells, and its loss is synthetic lethal with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). This work unveils new functions of HELLS in modulating SSB repair and responses to clinically relevant DNA alkylation damage, thus offering new insights into the potential therapeutic value of targeting HELLS in cancer.© The Author(s) 2025.
