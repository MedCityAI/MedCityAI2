41183253,Natural History and Phenotypic Spectrum of Myofibrillar Myopathies and Myopathies Associated With MFM-Related Genes.,"Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a pathologically defined but genetically heterogeneous myopathy; however, myofibrillar pathology may be absent in some patients with pathogenic variants in MFM-related genes. The natural history of MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes remains poorly characterized.We retrospectively reviewed patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic (January 1993-March 2024) with either pathologically confirmed MFM or myopathies associated with MFM-related genes. Patients without genetic testing or skeletal muscular manifestations were excluded.Eighty patients were identified; 56 were genetically characterized (23 with DES, 10 with MYOT, 9 with LDB3, 2 with FLNC, 2 with BAG3, 2 with CRYAB, 1 with FHL1, and 7 others). Myofibrillar pathology was observed in 60 of 65 biopsied patients. The median age at symptom onset was 42.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20.2-57.0); 66 presented with muscular onset and 14 with cardiac onset. With a median disease duration of 13.1 years (IQR 8.1-24.0) from symptom onset to last visit, all patients had weakness, commonly distal-predominant (n = 34), followed by proximal-predominant (n = 24) and diffuse (n = 11) weakness. Dysphagia occurred in 16 patients, with 4 requiring feeding tubes. Peripheral neuropathy was found in 21 patients (13 with axonal large fiber neuropathy and 8 with small fiber neuropathy), mostly mild in severity. Gait aids were required in 46 patients (median 10.0 years after onset), and 17 became wheelchair-bound (median 19.0 years after onset). By age 60, 67% and 31% of patients with desminopathy required gait aids and were wheelchair-bound, respectively, compared with 12% and 0% of those with myotilinopathy and 25% and 0% of those with LDB3-related myopathy. Cardiac involvement (n = 31) and respiratory involvement (n = 33) were frequent, manifesting at a median of 7 and 9 years, respectively, after myopathy onset. Seven patients (2 with DES, 1 with ACTA1, 4 genetically uncharacterized) died, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications. Patients with desminopathy exhibited earlier and higher rates of cardiac involvement (p < 0.001), more frequent respiratory involvement (p = 0.029), earlier gait aid dependence (p = 0.018) despite a similar age at ambulation loss (p = 0.418), lower prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.022), and a similar mortality rate (p = 1.000).MFM and myopathies associated with MFM-related genes are clinically heterogeneous, with desminopathy showing earlier cardiac manifestations and gait aid requirement and more frequent cardiopulmonary involvement. Given the phenotypic variability, genetic diagnosis is crucial for patient management and prognosis.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Wannarong T|Milone M|Selcen D|Dyck P J B|Liewluck T,Wannarong T,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.","Wannarong T, Milone M, Selcen D, Dyck P J B, Liewluck T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183253/,"This study found that myofibrillar myopathy and related genetic conditions have a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, swallowing difficulties, nerve problems, and heart and lung issues.

41160791,What Are the Functions of Interoception and Allostasis and Their Contribution to Neurologic Symptoms?,"Interoception is the sensing and representation of signals from the internal organs and involves a bidirectional communication between the brain and the body. Interoception also supports allostasis, which is the process by which the brain anticipates the needs of the body and preemptively initiate responses to meet internal or external demands. The coordination between these 2 processes is orchestrated by a distributed allostatic-interoceptive brain network. Impaired interoceptive accuracy, allostatic overload, and central sensitization contribute to the manifestations of neurodegenerative disorders and chronic functional neurologic symptoms.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Casar J C|Idiaquez J|Benarroch E,Benarroch E,"Departamento de Neurologia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago de Chile; and.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.","Casar J C, Idiaquez J, Benarroch E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160791/,"The key finding of this medical research is that interoception, the sensing of internal signals, and allostasis, the brain's process of anticipating and responding to the body's needs, work together in a network that is important for neurological symptoms.

41160790,Effectiveness of Infliximab for Refractory Nonischemic Cerebral Enhancing Foreign-Body Granulomatous Lesions After Endovascular Therapy.,"Nonischemic cerebral enhancing (NICE) foreign-body granulomatous lesions are an immune-mediated complication of endovascular therapy (EVT). No single immunotherapy has demonstrated consistent effectiveness. We highlight the novel use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibition in treating refractory NICE lesions.This multicenter case series describes 3 patients with refractory NICE lesions (recurrent seizures, persistent MRI enhancement, and/or steroid dependence with failure of ≥1 maintenance immunotherapy) treated with infliximab. Their clinical course, evaluation, and outcomes are detailed.Patients were women (median age 57 years [range 56-58]), presenting with headache and seizures within 6 months of EVT for intracranial aneurysm (n = 2) or carotid stenosis (n = 1). MRI (n = 3) revealed unilateral nodular enhancement with vasogenic edema, and brain biopsy (n = 2) revealed foreign-body granulomatous inflammation. All patients developed refractory disease and steroid dependence despite ≥1 immunotherapy including mycophenolate (n = 3), rituximab (n = 1), and/or cyclophosphamide (n = 1). Infliximab treatment resulted in significant clinical and radiologic improvement in all 3 patients.TNF-α inhibition may be an effective targeted treatment strategy for NICE foreign-body granulomatous lesions, expanding treatment options for patients with refractory disease. Larger prospective studies are needed to establish treatment guidelines aimed at improving outcomes in individuals with refractory disease.This article provides Class IV evidence that infliximab may offer potential benefit in patients with NICE lesions after EVT.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Aboseif A|Taha F|Tagg N T|Smith A D|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|Perez Giraldo G S|McKeon A,Aboseif A|Flanagan E P|Brown R D|Pittock S J|McKeon A,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.|Departments of Neurology & Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.|Multiple Sclerosis Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Geisel School of Medicine Dartmouth College, Dartmouth, NH.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.|Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.","Aboseif A, Taha F, Tagg N T, Smith A D, Flanagan E P, Brown R D, Pittock S J, Perez Giraldo G S, McKeon A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160790/,"This study found that the drug infliximab, which blocks a specific protein involved in inflammation, can effectively treat a rare and difficult-to-treat complication of endovascular therapy called nonischemic cerebral enhancing foreign-body granulomatous lesions.

41151001,Expert Consensus on Genetic Diagnostic Approaches for Patients With Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy.,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is the phenotypic description of a clinically and genetically diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders involving proximal muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdles. There are currently over 30 different genetic forms of LGMD, and despite diagnostic advances, accurate diagnoses may be difficult to achieve. Although clinical diagnosis of a patient with a specific form of LGMD is possible in some cases, a precise and timely genetic diagnosis can be crucial to anticipate and prevent complications associated with particular genetic forms of LGMD (e.g., extramuscular manifestations such as cardiac, respiratory, or cognitive impairments). With the rapid pace of genetic testing advances, updates on training and education are imperative to support the correct use of these tests. We formed an expert consensus to provide an efficient diagnostic approach meant to empower clinicians in the use of genetic and other supportive tests. Informed selection and interpretation of a gene panel; use of genome or exome sequencing; and use of biochemical, imaging, pathology, and electromyography tests are discussed here. Ultimately, genetic testing should help to confirm a diagnosis and guide treatment decisions or counseling services.",Neurology,"Nov 25, 2025",2025,Nov,25,Straub V|Clause A R|Donkervoort S|Kang P B|Laverty C G|Niu Z|Wicklund M P|Bönnemann C G|Cooper S T|Díaz-Manera J|Johnson N E|Narayanaswami P|Vissing J|Walter M C|Craige C|Weihl C C,Niu Z,"John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University and Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom.|Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.|Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD.|Greg Marzolf Jr. Muscular Dystrophy Center and Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.|Institute for Translational Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.|Department of Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego.|Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|UT Health San Antonio, TX.|Kids Neuroscience Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|Functional Neuromics, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.|Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.|Department of Neurology, Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.|Friedrich-Baur-Institute at the Department of Neurology, LMU University Hospital, Munich, Germany; and.|Kay Square Scientific, Butler, PA.","Straub V, Clause A R, Donkervoort S, Kang P B, Laverty C G, Niu Z, Wicklund M P, Bönnemann C G, Cooper S T, Díaz-Manera J, Johnson N E, Narayanaswami P, Vissing J, Walter M C, Craige C, Weihl C C",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41151001/,"The key finding of this medical research is that there are over 30 different genetic forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), and a precise genetic diagnosis is crucial to anticipate and prevent complications associated with particular genetic forms of LGMD.

40875595,Beyond platelet counts: assessing safety of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use in ITP.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) carries an increased risk of thrombosis, which may be further amplified by splenectomy and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). Although each intervention has been individually studied for its thrombotic risk, data are lacking on the safety of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with ITP who underwent splenectomy between 2011 and 2024. Patients were stratified on the basis of postsplenectomy TPO-RA use. The primary outcome was incidence of thrombosis. Secondary outcomes included bleeding, mortality, and hematologic response. Time-to-event analyses and multivariate Cox regression were performed. Among 88 patients, 37 (42%) patients received TPO-RAs after splenectomy. Thrombosis occurred in 17 patients in the TPO-RA group vs 14 patients in the non-TPO-RA group (P = .07). The 10-year cumulative incidence of thrombosis was numerically higher in the TPO-RA group (57% vs 36%), with clustering of events within the 3 months of postsplenectomy TPO-RA initiation. Venous events predominated; arterial events were rare. No significant differences were observed in bleeding or mortality rates between groups. Platelet counts alone did not independently affect bleeding or thrombosis. TPO-RA use after splenectomy was not significantly associated with increased thrombosis risk. However, early initiation may coincide with a high-risk period, and the sustained numerical difference in cumulative incidence throughout follow-up highlights potential clinical relevance. These findings support the need for individualized thromboprophylaxis and prospective evaluation of TPO-RA safety in this setting.© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40815797,The MAGIC composite response: a novel end point integrating clinical and biomarker parameters for acute GVHD.,"Changes in the clinical symptoms of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are currently used to assess treatment responses. The Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) consortium has recently revealed that the integration of serum biomarkers with clinical symptoms at the onset of treatment in a MAGIC composite score (MCS) more accurately predicts treatment response and 6-month nonrelapse mortality (NRM) than clinical symptoms alone. In this study, we evaluated whether the integration of serum biomarkers and clinical symptoms on day 28 (D28) would also better predict NRM than clinical response only (CRO). We analyzed data from 1135 patients receiving systemic treatment for acute GVHD and created a fourth MCS category for patients with complete resolution of symptoms and low-risk clinical biomarkers on D28. Using a classification and regression tree model with 6-month NRM as the end point, we identified status of MCS 0 or MCS 1 at D28 as responses, which we termed the MAGIC composite response (MCR). In the validation cohort (n = 309), MCR more accurately predicted 6-month NRM than CRO (area under the curve: 0.77 vs 0.69; P = .014) and demonstrated higher negative and positive predictive values. MCR correctly reclassified both clinical nonresponders and responders: 28 of 213 clinical responders (13%) became nonresponders with fivefold higher NRM (34.3% vs 6.8%, P < .001) and a larger group (29/96, 30%) of clinical nonresponders became responders with sixfold lower NRM (7.6% vs 50.7%, P < .001). These findings support the use of MCR as a superior surrogate end point for long-term GVHD control and survival in future clinical trials.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

40811832,Non-DLBCL monomorphic and Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD: clinical insights and treatment strategies.,"Monomorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) beyond diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are rare, biologically heterogeneous entities with limited prospective data to guide treatment. DLBCL-PTLD, which comprises most cases, is managed using approaches informed by prospective phase 2 studies, including reduction in immunosuppression and a risk-adapted sequential immunochemotherapy approach. In contrast, non-DLBCL subtypes such as Burkitt lymphoma, PTLDs of T/NK-cell origin, and plasmacytic variants are less common and are typically treated using strategies extrapolated from established treatment algorithms used in immunocompetent patients and sporadic case reports. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD, although not classified as monomorphic, represents another distinct and clinically relevant subtype. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcomes associated with these less common PTLDs, aiming to provide a practical framework for their management.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

41284657,The Weekend Effect on Evidence-Based Care Adherence Before and After Implementation of Checklist-Based Care in the Intensive Care Unit: A Multinational Study.,"BackgroundAdherence to evidence-based care processes and patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) can be influenced by staffing and resource availability. We aimed to evaluate if there is a weekend effect on adherence to evidence-based care processes, and hospitalization outcomes and whether a checklist implementation could mitigate potential differences.MethodsPost hoc analysis of the Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and Injury (CERTAIN) study dataset collected before and after checklist implementation in 34 ICUs across 15 countries (2013-2017). Admission days were classified as 'weekend/holidays' or 'weekdays' according to local work schedules and public holidays. The primary outcome was the omission of 10 evidence-based care processes addressed in the checklist. Mortality and length of stay differences between weekend/holiday and weekday admissions were evaluated as secondary outcomes.Results4256 patients contributed 1141 weekend versus 3501 weekday observation days pre-intervention, and 2014 versus 6507 post-intervention. Pre-intervention, peptic ulcer prophylaxis was omitted more frequently on weekends/holidays than weekdays (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.58 [95%-confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.88), whereas head-of-bed elevation was omitted more often on weekdays than on weekends/holidays (aRR, 3.17 [1.14-8.86]). Post-intervention, peptic ulcer prophylaxis omission rates became similar (aRR, 1.03 [0.68-1.56], but head-of-bed elevation became omitted more often on weekends than on weekdays (aRR, 0.63 [0.45-0.88]). Post-intervention, oral care was omitted more frequently on weekends/holidays than in weekdays (aRR, 0.63 [0.45-0.9]), and central catheter removal was more frequent on weekdays than in weekends/holidays (aRR, 1.11 [1.02-1.21]). No significant differences in mortality or length of stay were found.ConclusionA weekend effect influenced adherence to some care processes. While checklist implementation improved overall adherence, some disparities diminished, while new ones emerged.

41066183,Methylation-induced suppression of YAP/TAZ confers sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors in high-grade IDH mutant gliomas.,"IDH1/2 mutations (IDHmut) increase methylation of DNA and histones in gliomas. IDHmut inhibitors are effective against low-grade IDHmut gliomas, but new strategies against high-grade IDHmut gliomas are needed. Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are ineffective against IDHwt glioblastoma (GBM), their potential in IDHmut gliomas has not been extensively studied. We previously established that IDHmut gliomas are more sensitive to HDACi than IDHwt GBM. Here we show that IDHmut is associated with greater sensitivity to HDACi only in glioma, not in IDHmut chondrosarcoma or cholangiocarcinoma. While HDACi induced more histone acetylation and gene regulation in IDHmut glioma than in IDHwt GBM, such acetylation was mostly within gene deserts, whereas IDHmut glioma promoters paradoxically lost histone acetylation.

41100182,Ryanodine receptor 2-mediated calcium leak is associated with increased glyoxalase I in the aging brain.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by plaques and tangles, including calcium dysregulation and glycated products produced by reactive carbonyl compounds. AD brains have increased glyoxalase I (GLO1), a major scavenger of inflammatory carbonyl compounds, at early, but not later, stages of disease. Calcium dysregulation includes calcium leak from phosphorylated ryanodine receptor 2 (pS2808-RyR2), seen in aged macaques and AD mouse models, but the downstream consequences of calcium leak remain unclear. Here, we show that chronic calcium leak is associated with increased GLO1 expression and activity. In macaques, we found age-related increases in GLO1 expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), correlating with pS2808-RyR2, and localized to dendrites and astrocytes. To examine the relationship between GLO1 and RyR2, we used S2808D-RyR2 mutant mice exhibiting chronic calcium leak through RyR2, and found increased GLO1 expression and activity in the PFC and hippocampus as early as 1 month and as late as 21 months of age, with a bell-shaped aging curve. These aged S2808D-RyR2 mice demonstrated impaired working memory. As with macaques, GLO1 was expressed in astrocytes and neurons. Proteomics data generated from S2808D-RyR2 synaptosomes confirmed GLO1 upregulation. Altogether, these data suggest potential association between GLO1 and chronic calcium leak, providing resilience in early stages of aging.",JCI insight,"Nov 24, 2025",2025,Nov,24,Woo E|Datta D|Bathla S|Beatty H|Caglayan P|Albizu A K|Lam T T|Kanyo J|Joyce M K|Leslie S|Uchendu S|DeLong J|Guan Q S|Li J|Abramson E|Herman A L|Cooper D|Licznerski P|Horvath T L|Jonas E A|Nairn A C|Arnsten A F|Sansing L H,Caglayan P,"Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, and.|Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.|University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.|Department of Comparative Medicine.|Keck MS & Proteomics Resource, and.|Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.|Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, San Diego, California, USA.|Departments of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.|University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.|University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Endocrinology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA.|Department of Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.","Woo E, Datta D, Bathla S, Beatty H, Caglayan P, Albizu A K, Lam T T, Kanyo J, Joyce M K, Leslie S, Uchendu S, DeLong J, Guan Q S, Li J, Abramson E, Sansing L H, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41100182/,"The key finding of this research is that chronic calcium leak from a specific receptor (ryanodine receptor 2) is associated with increased levels of the enzyme glyoxalase I in the aging brain.

41267336,Modeling the acoustic profiles of vocal emotions in American English and Mandarin Chinese.,"This study examined the acoustic profiles of five basic emotions in American English and Mandarin Chinese using a big data approach. A total of 6,373 features were extracted using the openSMILE toolkit, and key discriminative features were identified through random forest classification. In American English, vocal emotions were primarily conveyed through pitch-related features, while Mandarin Chinese, shaped by its tonal constraints, relied more on spectral and voice quality cues, including MFCCs, HNR, and shimmer. Linear mixed-effects models confirmed significant effects of emotion on the top-ranked features, and Cohen's d further supported distinct acoustic profiles for each emotion. K-means clustering revealed both categorical groupings and dimensional overlaps, such as the clustering of high-arousal emotions like happy and surprised, and low-arousal emotions like sad and neutral. These results suggest that vocal emotion expression is shaped by language-specific prosodic systems, as well as by both discrete emotion categories and continuous affective dimensions, supporting an integrated model of emotional prosody.© 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Phonetica,"Nov 24, 2025",2025,Nov,24,Wang F,Wang F,"Department of Neurology, 6915 Mayo Clinic , Rochester, MN 55905, USA.",Wang F,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41267336/,"This study examined how people express emotions through their voice in American English and Mandarin Chinese.

41277369,Early Career Focus Among General Surgery Residents Pursuing Vascular Surgery Fellowship: A Multi-Institutional Study From the US ROPE Consortium.,"BackgroundRecent studies suggest that general surgery (GS) residents perform more operations related to their future specialty compared with their peers. In this multi-institutional study, we examined the process of early specialization among GS residents pursuing a career in vascular surgery (VS).MethodsData from the US Resident OPerative Experience (ROPE) Consortium, comprising 20 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited GS residency programs across the United States, were queried. Case volume and type were compared between GS residents pursuing vs fellowship and all other residents. Effect size was evaluated using Cohen's d statistic. Effect size was considered large if d > 0.8, moderate if 0.5 ≤ d < 0.8, small if 0.2 ≤ d < 0.5, and inconsequential if d < 0.2.ResultsA total of 1343 GS residents graduated from 2010-2020 across all programs participating in ROPE, of which 135 (10.1%) pursued vs fellowship. Total major vascular case volume was significantly greater among residents pursuing vs fellowship (138 [100-207] vs 100 [80-139], P < 0.0001) with a large effect size (d = 1.81). Vascular cases reported in a surgeon chief role (27 [9-53] vs 10 [2-29], P < 0.0001, d = 0.76, moderate effect) and surgeon junior role (107 [79-154] vs 88 [62-118], P < 0.0001, d = 1.00, large effect) were also greater among GS residents pursing a vs specialty.

41285724,European LeukemiaNet criteria for safety and efficacy evaluation of new drugs for myelofibrosis.,"Most myelofibrosis (MF) drug approvals by Health Authorities are based on 1 or 2 outcome measures such as spleen volume reduction and/or improved quality of life. This 1-2 dimensional approach fails to capture the clinical complexity of MF. A European LeukemiaNet (ELN) task force developed a composite endpoint that allows multiple outcomes to be simultaneously measured. The panel used the Desirability Of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) method to assign 25 outcomes into 4 quartiles based on a multi-dimensional desirability score and build a 5-layer composite outcome named Desirability of Myelofibrosis Outcomes (DEMYO). Outcome operational definitions were tested by Delphi consensus, and correlations with survival were validated by a literature review. The outcomes assigned to the first two quartiles were negatively correlated with leukemia-free survival and survival. DEMYO comprehensively captures relevant MF clinical features and meaningful endpoints. Despite DEMYO requiring validation based on available trial data, it is expected to improve the quality of Health Authority approvals for new drugs for MF.© 2025.

41285049,Adaptive neuromodulation dialogues: navigating current challenges and emerging innovations in neuromodulation system development.,"Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies.

41285545,Diagnostic Yield of CT Myelography for the Identification of CSF Leaks in Patients with Post Dural Puncture Headache.,"Post dural puncture headache (PDPH) refractory to conservative measures can be clinically debilitating, and diagnostic evaluation with spinal imaging including CT myelography (CTM) may be performed to localize a CSF leak and guide treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of CTM for detecting a CSF leak in patients with persistent PDPH.This is a single center, retrospective cohort study of patients referred for CTM between September 2013 to August 2025 to localize and/or identify a CSF leak in patients with PDPH. Brain MRIs were categorized as either positive or negative for findings of intracranial hypotension. CTMs were categorized as either positive or negative for the presence of a CSF leak or arachnoid bleb. The overall rate of CTM positivity in PDPH patients was calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate variables that were associated with positive CTM.A total of 118 PDPH patients were included in the analysis (81% female, mean age of 40 +/-12 years). Brain MRIs were negative for findings of intracranial hypotension in 92% of cases. Overall, CTM was positive in only 7 cases (5.9%, 7/118). Four were extradural fluid collections consistent with a CSF leak, and 3 were arachnoid blebs at the site of prior dural puncture. In three positive cases where both spine MRI and CTM available, the abnormality was also seen on MRI in two cases. On logistic regression, only a positive brain MRI was independently associated with a significantly higher odds of a positive CTM (OR 12.6 [CI: 1.8 to 90]; P=0.012).CTM has a low diagnostic yield in patients with PDPH, uncommonly identifying specific leak related findings. Because CTM necessarily involves repeat dural puncture, and given this low yield, it should be used sparingly in patients with refractory PDPH, especially when signs of intracranial hypotension are absent on brain MRI. As some findings on CTM are also seen on spinal MRI, which is noninvasive, further research is needed to compare the yield of MRI and CTM to determine whether and when CTM provides additional diagnostic information in this population.CTM＝ CT Myelogram; PDPH＝ Post Dural Puncture Headache; CSF = Cerebrospinal Fluid.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41285596,Unmet Health Care Needs of Adult Patients Adopted in Childhood: Insights and Recommendations.,"There is limited literature and guidance on the care of adopted patients in the medical setting beyond childhood. We examined the health care challenges faced by adults who were adopted as children and the perceived impact on the patient-clinician relationship.We administered a mixed-methods online survey to US adult adoptees examining perception of how adoptee status impacts their health care interactions. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and with a multivariate logistic regression model to assess associations between adoption-related health care experiences and care-seeking behaviors. Qualitative data were analyzed and organized thematically into 5 major themes.Analyses were based on 204 adults adopted in childhood. The majority reported that their medical professionals had gaps in their knowledge about adoption, especially regarding how limited family medical history can contribute to negative health outcomes. Most participants perceived multiple distinct types of adoption-related discrimination by clinicians. Those who experienced these negative interactions sometimes or more often had greater than 7 times the adjusted odds of delaying care or changing clinicians when compared with adoptees who experienced this discrimination rarely or not at all.In this exploratory study, we found that adoptees perceive medical professionals' lack of knowledge of the health implications of adoption as detrimental to their care and as undermining the patient-clinician relationship. Our findings suggest that adoption is both an experience and a potential identity with health implications that clinicians should be prepared to recognize and address.© 2025 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.",Annals of family medicine,"Nov 24, 2025",2025,Nov,24,Small J L|Dillon K|Wexler J H|Hebert S|Day P|Schulte E|Forkey H,Wexler J H,"Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts Juliasmallmd@gmail.com.|Department of Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.|Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.|Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.|Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.|Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York.|Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.","Small J L, Dillon K, Wexler J H, Hebert S, Day P, Schulte E, Forkey H",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41285596/,"The key finding of this medical research is that adults who were adopted as children often perceive a lack of knowledge about adoption-related health implications among their healthcare providers, which can negatively impact their care-seeking behaviors.

41285609,Continuity of Primary Care and Preventable Hospitalization for Acute Conditions: A Machine Learning-Based Record Linkage Study.,"Reducing potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH), also known as ambulatory care-senstive conditions, is a global concern. This study linked data from Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study on individuals aged 45 years and older from New South Wales, Australia, with Australian Medicare claims data to establish a causal relationship between continuity of care and acute PPH using a double machine learning model.We utilized 11 years of linked data (2007-2017) to analyze the impact of continuity of care on acute PPH, controlling for key patient characteristics (ie, age, multimorbidity status, cultural diversity, sex, education level, psychological status, physical limitation, smoking status, socioeconomic deciles). Estimation was done using a double machine learning technique with 4 algorithms (ie, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network) to ensure robustness.Among 54,376 participants, 27,634 individuals (50.8%) experienced at least 1 acute PPH episode during the 11-year study period. Our findings indicate that even a slight improvement in continuity of care can reduce the incidence of acute PPH compared with non-acute PPH. For example, the reduction in the probability of acute PPH compared with non-acute PPH ranges from 9.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-17.8%) to 23.5% (95% CI, 14.1%-32.4%) across 4 models when continuity of care increases from the 45th percentile (0.274) to the 50th percentile (0.301).Continuity of care at the primary level plays a key role in reducing acute PPH. Policies focused on person-centered or integrated care should include initiatives to promote continuity of care and support general practitioners in improving continuity of care.The authors of this article have provided Hindi and Vietnamese translations of the abstract.© 2025 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.",Annals of family medicine,"Nov 24, 2025",2025,Nov,24,Nguyen N M P|Borah B J|Barr M|Harris-Roxas B|Sharma A,Borah B J,"School of Population Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.|Mayo Clinic College of Medicine & Science, Rochester, Minnesota.|International Centre for Future Health Systems, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.|School of Population Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia anurag.sharma@unsw.edu.au.","Nguyen N M P, Borah B J, Barr M, Harris-Roxas B, Sharma A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41285609/,This study found that improving continuity of primary care can significantly reduce preventable hospitalizations for acute conditions.

41281371,Predicting Nonidiopathic Scoliosis from Plain Radiographs: A Deep-Learning Approach.,"Scoliosis has various etiologies, ranging from idiopathic, congenital, to those with spinal cord abnormalities. Advanced imaging is not always feasible and limited by cost, low-yield, and anesthesia risks in children. Given artificial intelligence's potential, we hypothesize that a deep learning (DL)-based image classifier will demonstrate superior performance in radiographic classification of scoliosis etiology compared witht experienced spine surgeons based on spine radiographs.One thousand thirty-six pediatric patients from single institution with scoliosis diagnosis and paired anterior-posterior - lateral images were included. Patients were manually classified based on their scoliosis etiology from chart review, including previous spine imaging studies when available. Categories included idiopathic, congenital, and spinal cord pathology. Images were randomized and assigned for training, validation, and testing. A DL-classifier using EfficientNet B4 architecture was trained on the radiographs. Accuracy and positive predictive value as defined by precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to assess final performance metrics.The trained classifier performed well at identifying correct etiologies, with F1-Score (harmonic mean of precision-recall) of 0.97. Model precision was 0.99 for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, 0.89 for congenital, and 0.78 for spinal cord pathology. Performance was higher on more common classes, with lower performance observed in class with fewer images. The algorithm has highest overall precision (0.96), recall (0.96), and F1 (0.96), while Surgeons 1 and 2 have lower accuracies (precision 0.80, recall 0.79, and F1 0.79 and precision 0.76, recall 0.67, and F10.71, respectively). There was no clear pattern identified regarding the surgeons' errors and poor agreement on which X-rays corresponded to underlying spinal cord pathology.A DL-convolutional-neural-network classifier has been trained to high degree of accuracy to distinguish between 3 scoliosis etiologies on pediatric spine radiographs. This model could provide a novel tool to clinicians to decide when to refer for axial imaging. It had superior diagnostic performance compared with experienced spine surgeons. After further validation and refinement, a clinician could put a patient's X-rays into the predictive tool for analysis and use the results to discuss with the family the risk of finding spinal cord pathology, helping them determine together the best timing for an MRI.Level III.
