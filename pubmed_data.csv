41310184,Proximal proteomics analysis reveals DNA polymerase δ subunit 3 is a new MCM2 binding partner and promotes parental histones inheritance in mammalian cells.,"In mammalian cells, MCM2 and POLE3/4 safeguard the symmetrical segregation of parental histones to the leading and lagging strands of newly synthesized DNA. However, the identity of additional proteins involved in parental histone distribution remains elusive. We used TurboID proximity labeling to identify interaction partners of MCM2 and POLE3/4 in mouse cells. This approach provided a candidate protein library potentially involved in the MCM2 and POLE3/POLE4-mediated process of parental histone segregation. DNA polymerase δ subunit 3 (POLD3) was a protein whose intensity differed between the interactomes of wild-type MCM2 and its histone-binding mutant. We showed POLD3 bound to both MCM2 and the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers. Moreover, MCM2's histone binding affected interactions between POLD3 and histone H3. More importantly, POLD3 was required for the symmetrical transfer of parental histones H3-H4 to the leading and lagging strands of newly synthesized DNA in mouse cells. In short, our findings establish that POLD3 forms a protein complex with MCM2 and histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers, functioning as a novel histone chaperone to regulate parental histone segregation in mammalian cells.© 2025.

41309663,Space radiation induces distinct senescent phenotypes: Implications for space travel.,"As Earth's magnetic field weakens, space radiation begins to pose a significant threat to the health of not only space travelers, but the world's population. Space radiation, comprising high-energy and high-charge ions, creates distinct clusters of DNA damage and dense macromolecular damage that result in the accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) known to play a critical role in promoting multimorbidity. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts exposed to different forms of space radiation acquire senescence-associated phenotypes including morphological alterations and the accumulation of SA-ß-gal+ cells to a greater extent than what is observed following γ-irradiation. Bulk and single cell RNA (scRNAseq) sequencing analysis revealed that space irradiated human fibroblasts up-regulated senescent-like phenotypes to a greater extent compared to γ-irradiation and enriched pathways associated with chronic activation and adaptation of the integrated stress response and NADPH-coupled redox metabolism. Healthy cells treated with conditioned media from irradiated SnCs manifested pro-inflammatory transcriptional profiles dependent on both radiation and cell type. Finally, treatment with known senotherapeutics demonstrated radiation-specific effects in primary dermal fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that space radiation differentially induces senescent phenotypes in human cells compared to γ-irradiation, which may play a key role in the pathogenic effects of space travel.© 2025.

41308031,Current and Future Utilization of Optical Genome Mapping: Insights From the 2024 College of American Pathologists Supplemental Questionnaire.,"Optical genome mapping (OGM) represents a promising cytogenomic technology that detects structural variants, including fusions, rearrangements, copy number variants, and loss of heterozygosity, in a single assay. Unlike karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or chromosomal microarray, OGM leverages long-molecule imaging to map the whole genome with high resolution. This positions OGM as a novel tool for constitutional and somatic/cancer genomics. However, its current and planned utilization in clinical and research settings remains unknown, necessitating further investigation.To investigate the current utilization of OGM in clinical and research laboratories, assess its applications, and evaluate future utilization strategies.In 2024, a supplemental questionnaire was incorporated into 6 College of American Pathologists proficiency testing programs to evaluate OGM's utilization.Of 921 returned questionnaires, 712 were analyzed after duplicates were removed. Sixty-seven (9.4%) currently offered OGM testing: 5.2% (37) for research only, 1.8% (13) for only clinical use, and 2.4% (17) for both. Future adoption plans showed 7.6% (53 of 700 laboratories) and 7.9% (55 of 700 laboratories) aiming to implement OGM clinically within 12 and 24 months, respectively. The most common applications included hematologic malignancies and constitutional/germline postnatal disorders, followed by prenatal testing. International laboratories demonstrated statistically higher utilization rates than domestic laboratories (P = .001).This first survey on OGM clinical utilization reveals its status as a niche technology, with 67 laboratories currently using it. Its primary clinical applications are in constitutional/germline analysis and hematologic malignancies. Although international laboratories led in 2024, 108 laboratories (domestic and international) plan clinical adoption within 24 months, signaling OGM's potential for broader integration.© 2025 College of American Pathologists.",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,"Nov 27, 2025",2025,Nov,27,Gardner J|Nusapan R|Tan J|Levy B|Tang G|Fang M|Velagaleti G V|Cao Y|Astbury C|Mixon J C|J Souers R|Peterson J F|Zou Y S,Peterson J F,"From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT (Gardner, Nusapan).|Department of Pathology, University of Illinois at Chicago (Tan).|the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York (Levy).|the Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (Tang).|the Department of Pathology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington (Fang).|the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (Velagaleti).|the Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri (Cao).|Division of Laboratory Medicine, Robert J Tomsich Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostics Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (Astbury).|the Department of Biostatistics, College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois (Souers).|the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (Peterson).|the Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland (Zou).","Gardner J, Nusapan R, Tan J, Levy B, Tang G, Fang M, Velagaleti G V, Cao Y, Astbury C, Mixon J C, J Souers R, Peterson J F, Zou Y S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41308031/,"Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a new technology that can detect various genetic changes in a single test.
