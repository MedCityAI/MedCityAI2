41232063,Altered Interictal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis Connectivity in Patients With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder, with 30%-50% of patients developing drug-resistant epilepsy. Pharmacoresistant seizures remodel critical arousal and respiratory networks, impairing autonomic function and chemoreception and putting patients at increased risk of adverse respiratory events and sudden unexpected death (SUDEP). Given that the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) serves as a key relay between brainstem respiratory nuclei and cortical arousal networks, we characterized interictal BNST connectivity alterations in patients with TLE.We conducted a case-control study of patients with drug-resistant TLE evaluated for epilepsy surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared with healthy controls with no history of neurologic disease. Inclusion criteria for patients included clinical TLE diagnosis and age 18-65 years. Using resting-state fMRI (multiband factor = 3, repetition time [TR] = 1.3 seconds), we measured functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity through Granger causality (GC) between BNST and whole-brain cortical networks, and brainstem nuclei. Graph theoretical network metrics assessed BNST hub properties. Statistical analyses used multiple comparison corrections and age-corrected z-scores.Thirty-seven patients with TLE (mean age 42.5 ± 12.1 years, 43.2% female) and 33 healthy controls (mean age 36.2 ± 12.0 years, 54.5% female) were studied. Patients demonstrated bilateral reductions in BNST connectivity and causal influence with the whole brain (FC: -2.31 ± 2.87, p = 0.0032; GC: -0.18 ± 0.08, p = 0.0025). While FC showed preserved BNST-brainstem connectivity, GC revealed ipsilateral disruptions in BNST influence over ventral tegmental area (0.023 ± 0.026, p = 0.0067), median raphe (-0.009 ± 0.029, p = 0.0038), and cuneiform nuclei (0.012 ± 0.062, p = 0.0153). Critical respiratory circuits showed divergent reorganization: dorsal raphe-parabrachial complex pathways exhibited 57.2% efferent reduction (p = 0.0028), with 204.6% compensatory afferent increase (p = 0.0020), while dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus circuits showed bilateral deterioration (66.2% reduction in dorsal raphe-locus coeruleus [DR→LC], p = 0.0015; 56.4% reduction in LC→DR, p = 0.0189). Graph analyses confirmed compromised BNST network integration bilaterally (p < 0.05).Our findings reveal network reorganization in TLE that compromises autonomic and arousal circuit integrity, leading to failed respiratory-autonomic integration that may underlie respiratory vulnerability and increased SUDEP risk; however, we did not directly study SUDEP cases.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Reda A|Doss D J|Makhoul G S|Monroy Lerma B H|Johnson G|Sainburg L E|Cavender A C|Sundrani S|Liao E|Roche A|Long I|Kang H|Dawant B|Chang C|Bick S K|Nobis W P|Morgan V|Englot D J,Johnson G,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Neurological Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), Nashville, TN.|Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.|Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; and.|Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.","Reda A, Doss D J, Makhoul G S, Monroy Lerma B H, Johnson G, Sainburg L E, Cavender A C, Sundrani S, Liao E, Roche A, Long I, Kang H, Dawant B, Chang C, Bick S K, Englot D J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41232063/,"Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showed reduced connectivity and influence of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a key brain region that integrates arousal and respiratory networks.

40751372,Comparability of Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Bile Acid Profiles in Patients With First or Multiply Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection.,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) treatment guidelines suggest varied approaches for patients with first (frCDI) or multiply recurrent CDI (mrCDI). Low microbial diversity, elevated primary bile acids (BA), and low secondary BA concentrations favor germination of C. difficile spores into toxin-producing bacteria and are believed to increase rCDI risk. Greater understanding of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in rCDI may inform management of the disease. We describe a post hoc comparison of GI microbiome and bile acid profiles between patients with frCDI and mrCDI in a Phase 3 open-label trial, ECOSPOR IV, of fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST®; VOS, formerly SER-109), an orally-administered live microbiome therapeutic.Patients received VOS following symptom resolution after standard-of-care antibiotics. Pretreatment baseline (within 3 days following antibiotic completion) and Week 1 post-dosing stool samples were collected for whole metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. Diversity was calculated from MetaPhlAn2 species profiles. Concentrations of primary and secondary BAs were measured via targeted LC-MS/MS.rCDI rates through Week 8 were similarly low in both frCDI and mrCDI patients (6.5% versus 9.7%, respectively). Baseline microbial diversity was similarly low between frCDI and mrCDI subgroups (P > .05). Diversity and secondary BA concentrations increased in both subgroups, whereas primary BA concentrations declined following VOS dosing, leading to few differences between subgroups at Week 1.These data suggest commonalities in microbiome disruption in patients with frCDI and mrCDI that contribute to recurrence and suggest that antibiotics followed by a live microbiome therapy may be an optimal treatment strategy for rCDI, regardless of number of prior CDI recurrences.© The Author(s) 2025.

40360931,Increasing Fluconazole Resistance in Candida parapsilosis: A 10-Year Analysis of Blood Culture Isolates at a US Reference Laboratory (2015-2024).,"Antifungal susceptibility testing among 1740 Candida parapsilosis blood isolates submitted to a United States reference laboratory (2015-2024) revealed a significant increase in fluconazole resistance from 8.2% to 20.3% (odds ratio [OR] per year, 1.13 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.06-1.20]; P < .001), with notable acceleration since 2021. Voriconazole resistance remained stable over this period. Micafungin resistance was rare, but intermediate susceptibility significantly increased, especially after 2021 (OR per year, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.25-1.63]; P < .001). These findings highlight important recent shifts in antifungal susceptibility among C parapsilosis isolates, emphasizing the need for ongoing surveillance and stewardship.© The Author(s) 2025.

41231466,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Cardiovascular Toxic Effects: International Cardio-Oncology Society Position Statement.,"The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has improved cancer outcomes but at the cost of adverse events, mainly related to the immune system. Cardiovascular (CV) toxic effects, and especially myocarditis, are of particular concern and are the subject of this position statement by the International Cardio-Oncology Society with representation of experts from oncology, hematology, and cardiology.CV toxic effects of ICI therapies include inflammation-associated diseases, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and vasculitis, as well as the aggravation of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis with acute ischemic complications (myocardial infarction and stroke). Patients taking ICI therapies can also develop cardiac dysfunction, stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo or apical ballooning syndrome), and heart failure without inflammatory cell infiltration of the myocardium. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias can emerge in the setting of a systemic inflammatory milieu, myocarditis, or ischemia. Of all potential CV adverse effects, myocarditis remains of highest concern, although fatality rates have declined over time with a broadening spectrum of presentations ranging from troponin elevation of uncertain significance to smoldering, nonsevere, and severe or fulminant myocarditis.Concerns for myocarditis continue to dominate the spectrum of CV toxic effects in patients receiving ICI therapy. Recommendations for management vary according to severity. Multidisciplinary collaborations remain key for managing acute toxic effects and future cancer treatment decisions, including ICI rechallenge. Ischemic heart disease constitutes the main differential diagnosis in these patients, while pericarditis can be concomitantly present, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias can also complicate the clinical picture. Several gaps in knowledge are identified and require further research.",JAMA oncology,"Nov 13, 2025",2025,Nov,13,Herrmann J|Barac A|Carver J|Cheng R K|Daniele A|Dent S|Deych E|Lee D H|Lenihan D|Leong D P|Liu J|Lopez-Fernandez T|Lyon A R|Fradley M|Macedo A V S|Mooradian M J|Nohria A|Porter C|Rassaf T|Suero-Abreu G|Sverdlov A L|Thavendiranathan P|Neilan T G|Mitchell J D,Herrmann J|Dent S,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Inova Schar Heart and Vascular, Inova Health, Fairfax, Virginia.|Thalheimer Center for Cardio-Oncology at the Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.|Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle.|Cardio-Oncology Department, Roffo Institute, Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Argentina.|Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.|Cardio-Oncology Center of Excellence, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.|Cardio-Oncology Section, Division of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa.|Cardio-Oncology Center of Excellence, Saint Francis Healthcare, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.|Population Health Research Institute, Department of Medicine, McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.|Cardio-Oncology Unit, Cardiology Department, La Paz University Hospital, IdiPAZ Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.|Cardio-Oncology Centre of Excellence, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom.|Thalheimer Center of Cardio-Oncology, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.|Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences of Santa Casa de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.|Mass General Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.|Cardiovascular Department, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|Cardio-Oncology Program, Cardiovascular Medicine Department, University of Kansas Hospital & Medical Center, Kansas City.|West German Heart and Vascular Center, Clinic for Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.|Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.|Newcastle Centre of Excellence in Cardio-Oncology, The University of Newcastle, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Calvary Mater Newcastle, Hunter New England Health, Newcastle, Australia.|Ted Rogers Program in Cardiotoxicity Prevention, Peter Munk Cardiac Center, Toronto General Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","Herrmann J, Barac A, Carver J, Cheng R K, Daniele A, Dent S, Deych E, Lee D H, Lenihan D, Leong D P, Liu J, Lopez-Fernandez T, Lyon A R, Fradley M, Macedo A V S, Mitchell J D, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41231466/,"The key finding of this medical research is that immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, while improving cancer outcomes, can also lead to serious cardiovascular side effects, particularly myocarditis.

40550700,Irregular Cervicothoracic Nerve Sheaths on Digital Subtraction Myelography: A CSF Venous Fistula Mimic.,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) can be caused by CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs), which often require a specialized lateral decubitus examination such as digital subtraction myelography (DSM) for diagnosis. DSM interpretations can be confounded by irregular nerve sheath diverticula at the cervicothoracic junction, potentially mimicking a true CVF. This study aimed to characterize anatomic variations of nerve sheaths at the cervicothoracic junction, in an effort to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.We retrospectively identified 35 patients with low-risk Bern scores who were negative for CVF on DSM. Nerve sheaths at C6-C7, C7-T1, and T1-T2 were classified as normal (<5 mm), elongated linear (≥5 mm), linear-bulbous, linear-branching, or diverticulum. Results were obtained on both the left and right side for each patient.Data were obtained for 34 patients. Among these, 74% (25/34) demonstrated at least 1 variant nerve sheath configuration. The most common site of variation was C7-T1 on the right (seen in 55%, 18/33), and the most frequent morphologic variant overall was an elongated linear sheath (28/198 levels; 40% of all variants).Nerve sheath morphology at the cervicothoracic junction is frequently irregular, and these variants can resemble a CVF on DSM. Recognizing such normal anatomic variations is essential to avoid unwarranted interventions for suspected CVF in patients evaluated for SIH.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

40571346,Multiple Synchronous CSF-Venous Fistulas in Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension: A Multi-Institutional Case Series.,"CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) are a common cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Due to the more routine use of decubitus myelography and advancements in various imaging techniques, recognition of CVFs has increased in recent years. Most commonly, patients harbor only 1 fistula at the time of myelography (although additional de novo fistulas can arise after treatment). Occasionally, 2 synchronous CVFs may be seen on a single myelogram. The coexistence of more than 2 CVFs, however, is quite rare and has only been previously described in 2 instances. Here, we present a multi-institutional series of 16 patients with 3 or more concurrently discovered CVFs, representing the largest cohort of such patients to date. We describe their clinical features, imaging findings, treatment approaches, and outcomes.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41230625,Cardiovascular Risks of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: A Narrative Review.,"The primary objective of this article is to examine literature from the last 10 years surrounding cardiovascular risks associated with NSAID use.A systematic search was developed to include randomized control trials and systematic review meta-analyses that focused on the cardiovascular effects associated with NSAID use.The search and screen identified 10 articles published in the last 10 years to be included in the review.The most common cardiovascular risks studied in the included literature were hemodynamic effects and myocardial infarction. The evidence in the included studies suggest that concerns of adverse hemodynamic effects may be overstated with short-term NSAID use. Myocardial infarction was shown to be a very serious, but rare, side effect associated with NSAID use. Practitioners should weigh this risk when using NSAIDs in patients with an increased risk of MI at baseline. Other included studies described risks of Kounis syndrome, QTc prolongation, and potential reversal of right ventricular dysfunction in patients using NSAIDs.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41230630,Assessing the Learning Curve of the Vertebral Body Tethering in Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Multicenter Analysis.,"Anterior vertebral body tethering (AVBT) is a promising fusionless alternative for treating idiopathic scoliosis; however, limited data exist on the learning curve for this procedure. Previous studies are limited by single-center and short-term complication data. This multicenter study assesses the learning curve by evaluating improvements in operative characteristics over time and radiographic measurements up to 2 years postoperatively.As recorded from a multicenter registry, surgeons with ≥10 index AVBT procedures for patients with idiopathic scoliosis aged 16 years and below were included. Relationships between case number and multiple surgical variables were determined using Pearson correlation and linear regression testing. For identification of an inflection point, consecutive cases were plotted against operative time per level and fitted with a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curve. Independent samples t test and χ2 test were used to compare outcomes between cases before and after the inflection point. Outcomes of interest included demographic, surgical, and radiographic information at the baseline, immediate postoperative, and 2-year timepointswhere available.Eight surgeons and 325 index AVBT patients met the inclusion criteria. Inverse relationships were identified between case number and estimated blood loss, operative time, anesthesia time, and fluoroscopic time per level (P < 0.005). The inflection point was identified at 15 cases. Operative time, anesthesia time, and fluoroscopy time per level were greater in the first 15 cases compared with those after (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in demographic variables, intraoperative complications, or length of stay between the early and late cases. Greater correction in the major coronal curve, minor coronal curve, and coronal balance occurred in the cases performed after the inflection point (P < 0.05).AVBT is a safe alternative to posterior spinal fusion and demonstrates a predictable improvement in surgical performance over time. Large improvements can be expected during the first 15 AVBT cases performed with minimal differences in complications.Level III.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41230719,Plantar vein thrombosis secondary to mechanical trauma: A rare cause of plantar foot pain.,"Plantar vein thrombosis is a rare vascular condition typically presenting with unilateral plantar foot pain and edema. Of interest to the musculoskeletal clinician, mechanical trauma to the plantar foot has been cited as a risk factor for development of these thrombi.To assess the demographics, presenting history, risk factors, treatment protocols, and long-term sequelae of patients with plantar vein thrombosis secondary to increased mechanical trauma.Retrospective chart review.Tertiary care center.Adult patients with mention of plantar vein thrombosis in imaging impressions.Primary outcome measure was determination of the demographic and clinical characteristics of plantar vein thrombosis in patients with mechanical trauma as a preceding risk factor. Secondary outcome was evaluation of treatment options in this patient population.Between 2005 and 2023, nine patients at a single institution were diagnosed with plantar vein thrombosis through imaging and were determined to have developed the thrombus due at least in part to mechanical trauma. Patients typically presented with localized plantar foot pain and foot edema. Diagnosis was made via magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. The most frequent treatment was therapeutic anticoagulation but initial conservative treatment with serial ultrasound resulted in conversion to anticoagulation in only one patient. Among those patients with mechanical trauma as an inciting factor, the only noted complication was propagation of the thrombosis in one patient.Although rare, plantar vein thrombosis should be considered by the musculoskeletal clinician in the differential diagnosis of unilateral plantar foot pain. Treatment of these thrombi is most commonly therapeutic anticoagulation, but in the absence of additional high-risk factors serial ultrasound evaluations may be an adequate first line treatment due to the overall minimal risk of thrombosis propagation.© 2025 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",PM R,"Nov 13, 2025",2025,Nov,13,Davis P T|Casanegra A I|Boettcher B J,Davis P T|Casanegra A I|Boettcher B J,"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Vascular Division, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Surgery, Division of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Davis P T, Casanegra A I, Boettcher B J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41230719/,"Plantar vein thrombosis is a rare condition that can be caused by mechanical trauma to the foot.

41231409,Method Validation of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 3 Assay.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) is a peptidase released from dying cells. It cleaves proteins in the renin-angiotensin pathway, which can result in hemodynamic instability. At elevated concentrations DPP3 is associated with worse outcomes, particularly in patients with shock. Herein we describe the assay performance of a DPP3 assay (4TEEN4 Pharmaceuticals GmbH) in human plasma.DPP3 concentration was measured using the DPP3 immunoluminometric assay (4TEEN4 Pharmaceuticals GmbH) and the signal was read using a luminometer (Berthold Centro LB963). Analytical performance was established for precision, linearity, accuracy, detection limit, analytical specificity, reference interval, kit lot-to-lot comparison, specimen type, and sample stability.Limit of detection was verified at 1.6 ng/mL in EDTA plasma with a coefficient of variation (CV) of <10%. Precision studies revealed a CV ≤ 6% at 28.5 ng/mL and 59.4 ng/mL and comparability with a manufacturer performed assay was demonstrated between 7.7 and 195.2 ng/mL. An upper 97.5% limit of 22 ng/mL without age or sex associations was verified in healthy donors. The assay was not susceptible to interference from lipemia or bilirubin. However, measured DPP3 concentrations increased linearly with increasing hemolysis. DPP3 concentrations are stable in EDTA plasma for up to 24 h and at least 11 months when stored ambient or at -80°C, respectively.DPP3 can be measured precisely in EDTA plasma using the immunoluminometric DPP3 assay.

41231680,Transformable Renal Cancer Targeted Responsive Nanopeptide Probes Effectively Inhibit Renal Cancer Progression and Metastasis by Inhibiting Renal Blood Vessels and Cancer Cells.,"Renal cancer is a highly vascularized tumor, and tumor vasculature accelerates the progression and metastasis of renal cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TIE-2 are the two most essential factors that facilitate tumor angiogenesis; additionally, VEGF has an angiogenesis-independent function in cancer cells that enhances their malignant progression. The long-term inhibition of dual targets, blood vessels and tumor cells, can effectively prevent the progression and metastasis of renal cancer. This study developed a transformable kidney cancer targeting responsive nanopeptide probe (RTP) for the construction of nanofibers in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which helped to significantly inhibit tumor neovascularization and progression through dual targets. The results showed that RTP reduced angiogenesis to 35.26% ± 4.78% by inhibiting VEGF and TIE-2 and increased tumor cell apoptosis by 6-fold. In vivo validation experiments showed that RTP significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis and progression. The innovative RTP significantly inhibits renal cancer angiogenesis and may provide a new way to inhibit renal cancer blood vessels and cancer cells.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,"Nov 13, 2025",2025,Nov,13,Kong B|Wu X|Li C|Liu P|Chen M|Liu Y|Liu C|Wang X|Chen B|Zang J|Jian L|Shen J|Yu J|Wu Q|Yang G|Wang Z|Liu M|Wang L,Kong B,"The Fourth Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, China.|Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, United States.|NHC Key Laboratory of Molecular Probe and Targeted Theranostics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.|Department of Urology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150001, China.|Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.|Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.","Kong B, Wu X, Li C, Liu P, Chen M, Liu Y, Liu C, Wang X, Chen B, Zang J, Jian L, Shen J, Yu J, Wu Q, Yang G, Wang L, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41231680/,"This study developed a transformable nanopeptide probe that effectively inhibits the progression and metastasis of renal cancer by targeting and inhibiting both the blood vessels that feed the tumor and the cancer cells themselves.

41231614,Troxerutin is a novel osmotic agent for peritoneal dialysis with protective cardiovascular actions.,"End-stage renal disease patients require peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a life-saving therapy; however, they continue to experience systemic inflammation and increased cardiovascular pathology. These complications can be exacerbated by exposure to PD solutions (PDS) containing glucose. This highlights the clinical unmet need for novel osmotic agents to replace glucose. Here, we tested troxerutin, an FDA-approved drug, as a potential osmotic agent.To evaluate troxerutin osmotic and non-toxic effects, in vitro and in vivo experiments were done using artificial membranes, mice and cultured human mesothelial cells (MCs). The local and systemic consequences of chronic peritoneal exposure to PDS associated to renal insufficiency were investigated in a preclinical model. 5/6 nephrectomized C57BL/6 J mice were daily exposed to glucose- or troxerutin-PDS for 60 days, then evaluating tissue damage, proinflammatory markers, and cardiac damage.In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that troxerutin exhibits similar osmotic and ultrafiltration capacities to glucose, but with colloidal properties. Moreover, only glucose, but not troxerutin, reduced MC viability, induced mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and increased damage markers (such as IL-6 and VEGF-A). In the preclinical model, long-term treatment with glucose-PDS, but not troxerutin-PDS, significantly increased peritoneal membrane thickening, tissue proinflammatory markers (evaluated in peritoneum, kidney, heart, and aorta) and cardiovascular damage (cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis) in mice. These preclinical data clearly demonstrate the wide deleterious effects of chronic peritoneal exposure to glucose-containing PDS in mice with kidney insufficiency and that the replacement of glucose with troxerutin notably reduces these effects.Troxerutin emerges as a more biocompatible alternative to glucose as an osmotic agent for PD therapy, exhibiting no adverse local or systemic side effects in preclinical studies. This research presents a novel approach to reduce cardiovascular complications of PD in end-stage kidney disease.© The Author(s) 2025.

41231774,One-year Outcomes of the MODULAR ATP Trial: A Novel Leadless Pacemaker in Wireless Communication with a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator.,"Background: MODULAR ATP (antitachycardia pacing), a multicenter, international trial, assesses a modular cardiac rhythm management system (mCRM): a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) in wireless communication with a leadless pacemaker (LP) capable of pace-terminating ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: Enrolees had one or more clinical risk factors for VT and did not require chronic pacing. Complications included pre-specified major LP system- and procedure-related complications, and any complication related to the LP, S-ICD, implantation, or study protocol. Survival analysis was performed to identify complication-free rates, therapy delivery, and all-cause mortality. Results: The 297 patients enrolled had an ejection fraction 35±13%, 43% secondary prevention indications, and 59% with prior ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Of 286 patients undergoing LP implantation (100% success), 251 patients completed 12-month follow-up. Mortality rate was 6%, with none related to the implant procedure. Median follow-up duration was 23.4 months (interquartile range: 17.9-28.1). The LP major complication-free rate was 97.2%, exceeding the performance goal. The overall LP+S-ICD system-related complication-free rate was 88.5%. Appropriate tachyarrhythmia-therapy (ATP+shock) rates were 14.4% and appropriate shock rates were 8.5%. Inappropriate total tachyarrhythmia therapy was 9.5% of which 8.5% were shocks. ATP was 67.3% successful in terminating VA episodes and accelerated VAs in 10.1% of episodes. Overall therapy burden (ATP+shock) was 96/100 patient-years of which 44/100 patient-years was for shock delivery. Conclusions: One-year outcomes of the first modular pacing-defibrillator system reveal low system and LP complication rates and good ATP efficacy rates suggesting that the mCRM is a viable alternative to single-chamber ICDs using low-energy pacing capability without the need for transvenous leads.",Circulation.

41233166,Intraperitoneal metastasis of gastric cancer: new insights on resident macrophages.,"Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is a common and lethal complication of gastric cancer (GC), occurring in approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease. It is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment and limited response to current systemic therapies, resulting in a median survival of only 3-6 months. The objective of this review was to explore the critical role of resident macrophages within the peritoneal immune microenvironment in the development and progression of GC PM, and to discuss their potential as therapeutic targets. Peritoneal resident macrophages (PRMs), particularly the GATA6⁺ large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs), are hijacked by GC cells through metabolic reprogramming, transcriptional regulation, and paracrine signaling. These macrophages adopt a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype, promote immunosuppression via T-cell exclusion and Treg recruitment, facilitate cancer cell adhesion and spheroid formation, and contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), nanoparticle-mediated macrophage repolarization, CSF-1 R/CCR2 axis inhibition, and chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-M), show promise in targeting these cells to restore antitumor immunity. In conclusion, resident macrophages are pivotal in shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of GC PM. Targeting these cells represents a promising avenue for novel combination therapies aimed at improving outcomes for patients with GC PM.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

41233616,Colorectal Cancer Screening and Mortality Trends in the United States Over 25 Years: A Story of Success and Inequity.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the USA and second leading cause of cancer deaths. While screening rates have increased and mortality rates have declined, disparities persist. This study investigates the screening rates and mortality correlation over 25 years.We analyzed trends in age-adjusted CRC screening and mortality rates (AAMRs) for adults aged ≥ 50 using BRFSS and CDC WONDER databases, respectively. Correlation analysis between CRC screening rates and AAMRs and projected AAMRs at 100% screening rates were calculated using Jamovi and R software.CRC screening rates increased from 41.5% in 1999 to 76.3% in 2023. Non-Hispanic Whites recorded the highest rates (80.1%), while American Indians or Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) had a low screening rate of 48.65% in 2023. Non-insured individuals had a screening rate of 33.02%, while insured recorded 78.13% in 2023. AAMRs of CRC declined significantly over time, from 69.3% to 40.7% per 100,000 (1999-2024). AAMRs demonstrated a strong inverse correlation (- 0.885) with screening rates. Correlation analysis revealed stronger associations between screening and mortality for NH Whites and African Americans (AA) populations (- 0.824 and - 1.19, respectively). The projected AAMR at 100% screening was 18.91 (95% CI 17.92-19.91), versus 40.4 at 76.3% in 2023.CRC screening increased over the past 25 years, achieving 76.3% in 2023, correlating with decrease in AAMRs. Disparities persist across races and different socioeconomic groups. At 100% screening rates, projected AAMR is 18.919. Equity-focused interventions are needed to further increase CRC screening rates.© 2025.

41233706,Financial Toxicity among Survivors of Extremity and Pelvic Sarcoma: A Retrospective Study.,"Financial toxicity in oncology, defined as the economic burden and psychosocial distress of cancer care, has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite high projected treatment costs, data on financial toxicity in patients with sarcoma remain limited. This study aimed to characterize financial toxicity in survivors of sarcoma and to better inform screening practices for patients with rare cancers requiring complex, multidisciplinary treatment plans.This retrospective cohort study surveyed patients with a diagnosis of trunk or extremity sarcomas between 2016 and 2024 (i.e., survivors of sarcoma). Patients were administered the COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) instrument, which has been validated with cancer patients. Scores ranged from 0 to 44. Financial toxicity was categorized into moderate-to-severe (score <26) and low-to-none (score ≥26) groups. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from electronic medical records. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore variables associated with financial toxicity.Among 205 participants, 77 % reported moderate-to-severe financial toxicity. The odds of financial toxicity were similar across insurance types, race, ethnicity, employment status, income, and geography. Patients were less likely to report financial toxicity if they had soft tissue sarcomas (compared with bone sarcomas; odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.98).Financial toxicity is highly prevalent among survivors of sarcoma. The widespread nature of this financial distress across different patient groups suggests that no specific population is disproportionately affected, underscoring the universal risk of financial toxicity. These findings support exploring universal financial toxicity screening for patients with sarcoma to facilitate timely interventions.© 2025.

40527584,Application of Convolutional Neural Network Denoising to Improve Conebeam CT Myelographic Images.,"Conebeam CT (CBCT) is an imaging technique that provides high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging in the fluoroscopy suite. In neuroradiology, CBCT has been used for various applications including temporal bone imaging and during spinal and cerebral angiography. Furthermore, CBCT has been shown to improve imaging of spinal CSF leaks during myelography. One drawback of CBCT is that images have a relatively high noise level. In this technical report, we describe the first application of a high-resolution convolutional neural network to denoise conebeam CT myelographic images. We show examples of the resulting improvement in image quality for a variety of types of spinal CSF leaks. Further application of this technique is warranted to demonstrate its clinical utility and potential use for other CBCT applications.© 2026 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41220603,"Retrograde Intramedullary Femoral Lengthening With Acute Deformity Correction in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults.","Acquired and congenital limb length discrepancies often coexist with deformities of the distal femur. Lengthening of the femur along its anatomic axis changes the limb's mechanical alignment. Angular correction and lengthening can be achieved at the same site if a retrograde lengthening nail is used with a specific preoperative planning method (""reverse planning"") which permits patient-specific selection of the final mechanical axis.A consecutive cohort series of children, adolescents, and young adults (mean 15.6 ± 4.8 years) undergoing retrograde implantable femoral lengthening between the years 2011 and 2024 were analyzed. Surgical details, lengthening parameters, Limb Lengthening and Reconstruction Society (LLRS)-AIM index, accuracy of final correction, and complications were reviewed and classified. Patients were eligible only if the distal femoral physis was closed.Seventy-three lengthening were eligible in the study period. Average lengthening was 4.2 ± 1.4 cm (range 2.0-8.0 cm), and consolidation index was 39.4 ± 21.9 days/cm. Deformities and length discrepancies were moderately complex, with a mean LLRS AIM score of 6 (range 1-13). Complication rates were similar to previous reports of intramedullary femoral lengthening, comparable between congenital (12 of 31, 39%) and acquired etiologies (16 of 42, 38%). Preoperative coronal alignment ranged from 14° varus to 20° valgus, while final coronal alignment was 0.4° ± 3.4° of neutral (range 7° valgus to 13° varus). Coronal deformities up to 20° and sagittal deformities up to 23° were corrected acutely at the lengthening site.Retrograde intramedullary femoral lengthening with acute deformity correction at the same site is an alternative to antegrade lengthening with separate osteotomy of the distal femur in children and adolescents. The reverse planning method allows reproducible length and deformity correction at the same location. Specific intraoperative technical adjuncts are used to achieve and maintain the desired alignment.Diagnostic Level IV.
