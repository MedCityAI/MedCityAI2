41193916,CT patterns of acute enterocolitis - a practical guide for the emergency radiologist.,"Acute enterocolitis encompasses a broad spectrum of conditions affecting the small and large bowel, frequently presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Given the clinical overlap among infectious, inflammatory, immune-mediated, vascular, and miscellaneous etiologies, imaging plays a pivotal role in refining the differential diagnosis, identifying complications, and guiding timely management. Computed tomography (CT), owing to its accessibility and rapid acquisition, remains the cornerstone of imaging evaluation in acute settings. CT enables detailed assessment of bowel wall morphology, disease distribution, vascular involvement, and extraintestinal manifestations. While ancillary imaging modalities have a role in select scenarios, this review emphasizes a CT-focused approach tailored for acute care. We present a comprehensive, pattern-based review of the CT imaging features across various forms of acute enterocolitis, highlighting diagnostic hallmarks, interpretive pitfalls, and clinically relevant mimics. The included cases were encountered by the radiologists in their day-to day practice and included based on their ability to highlight the majority representative features of each pathology. Through the integration of structured tables, illustrative cases, and diagnostic tips, this article aims to enhance the radiologist's ability to recognize key imaging signatures, avoid diagnostic errors, and contribute meaningfully to multidisciplinary patient care.© 2025.

41193901,Interpretive consistency of a qualitative 68Ga-PSMA PET framework for treatment response assessment in hepatocellular carcinoma: a head-to-head comparison with cross-sectional imaging.,"Accurate treatment response assessment in HCC is crucial but challenged by interpretive variability on CT/MRI. PSMA has emerged as a theranostic biomarker in HCC; however, interpretive reliability is a prerequisite for its validation against oncologic outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated interpretive consistency of a qualitative 68Ga-PSMA PET framework for treatment response assessment in HCC, benchmarking it against CT/MRI criteria.Patients with treatment-naïve HCC were prospectively enrolled for 68Ga-PSMA PET under an FDA IND application. Eligibility for analyses necessitated a baseline 68Ga-PSMA-avid target lesion with post-treatment 68Ga-PSMA PET and CT/MRI for response assessment following either locoregional therapy (LRT) or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI). Three radiologists independently assessed response on 68Ga-PSMA PET using a 4-point scale, subsequently dichotomized to viable (uptake > liver) versus non-viable status (uptake ≤ liver). Reliability was benchmarked against binary mRECIST, defined by arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), ordinal and binary RECIST 1.1, and binary LR-TR criteria. Inter- and intra-reader agreement were quantified using Gwet's agreement coefficients (AC1/AC2), with differences between dichotomized methods compared using non-parametric bootstrapping.From 88 patients with baseline 68Ga-PSMA PET, 13 were eligible: 7 with 10 lesions received LRT, and 6 with 19 lesions received ICI. Overall inter-reader agreement on 68Ga-PSMA PET was almost perfect for both the 4-point qualitative scale (Gwet's AC2: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.96) and the binary viable/non-viable status (AC1: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.00). Intra-reader agreement was also almost perfect (AC1 range: 0.86-0.93). In contrast, inter-reader agreement for mRECIST was moderate (AC1: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29-0.77), though its intra-reader agreement was more robust (AC1 range: 0.72-0.86). In the ICI subgroup, inter-reader agreement using 68Ga-PSMA PET (AC1: 0.93) was significantly higher than for mRECIST (AC1: 0.37; mean ΔAC1 = 0.53, 95% CI for difference: 0.19-0.85, P = 0.006) and dichotomized RECIST 1.1 (AC1: 0.39; mean ΔAC1 = 0.52, 0.25-0.83, P < 0.001). In the LRT subgroup, inter-reader agreement using 68Ga-PSMA PET (AC1: 0.89) was also almost perfect, but not significantly different from mRECIST (AC1: 0.87) or dichotomized LR-TR (AC1: 0.88) (P > 0.99 for both), with similarly high and comparable intra-reader agreement across all methods in both subgroups (P = > 0.99).A qualitative PSMA PET framework for HCC treatment response assessment yields nearly perfect interpretive consistency, outperforming CT/MRI-based criteria in post-ICI settings. These findings provide the foundation to validate PSMA-based response against oncologic outcomes in future clinical trials, a critical step toward guiding patient management and accelerating therapeutic innovation in HCC.© 2025.

41191126,"Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell-Expansion in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (pDC‑AML): a Review of Clinicopathologic Features, Genetics, and Outcomes.","Plasmacytoid dendritic cell-expansion in acute myeloid leukemia (pDC-AML) is an uncommon AML subset that differs from conventional AML and from blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). This review synthesizes the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of pDC-AML, highlights its outcomes, and discusses emerging therapeutic approaches, while underscoring the need for further studies to refine classification and guide therapy.Published cohorts show that pDC-AML occurs mainly in older male adults, with CD123 and HLA-DR forming a consistent immunophenotypic backbone across both myeloblasts and pDCs. pDC-restricted markers (CD303, CD304, CD4, TCL1) are confined to the pDC compartment, whereas myeloblasts are enriched for CD34, CD117, and TdT. Cytogenetic findings are heterogeneous but often adverse, with recurrent - 7/del7q and trisomy 13. RUNX1 mutations and secondary-type co-mutations (ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, splicing factors) are frequent, while activating mutations such as FLT3 or NRAS are variably present. Outcomes are generally inferior compared with other AML subsets, though allogeneic transplantation can achieve durable remissions in a subset. Reports on venetoclax-based therapy show mixed outcomes, while CD123-directed therapies are being explored. pDC-AML is emerging as a potentially higher-risk AML phenotype, with clinicopathologic and biologic features distinct from BPDCN. Early recognition, dual-compartment minimal residual disease assessment, timely transplant consideration, and referral for clinical trials are central to management. Standardized immunophenotypic criteria, integrated genomic profiling, and prospective evaluation of CD123-targeted and rational combination therapies are priorities to improve classification, risk stratification, and patient outcomes.© 2025.

40911649,Mean Body Mass Index Does Not Increase or Decrease at 10 Years After Primary Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty.,"Although patients often aim to lose weight after total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), long-term changes in body mass index (BMI) are unknown. We analyzed BMI at 2, 5, and 10 years after primary THA and TKA and determined predictors of BMI change.We identified patients who underwent primary THA or TKA for osteoarthritis between 2001 and 2011 and had a BMI at surgery and at 2, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. This resulted in 763 patients (310 who underwent THA and 453 who underwent TKA). The mean patient age was 66 years, and 60% of patients were female. BMI changes were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Multinomial logistic regression determined predictors of BMI change.Following THA, the mean BMI increased from 30.3 kg/m 2 at surgery to 30.9 kg/m 2 at both 2 years (p = 0.003) and 5 years (p = 0.002). Following TKA, the mean BMI increased from 32.7 kg/m 2 at surgery to 33.1 kg/m 2 at both 2 years (p = 0.053) and 5 years (p = 0.040). By 10 years, the mean BMI was 30.6 kg/m 2 (p = 0.453) for patients undergoing THA and 32.6 kg/m 2 (p = 0.947) for patients undergoing TKA, similar to the BMIs at surgery. At 10 years, 27% of patients who underwent THA and 30% of patients who underwent TKA had a BMI decrease of >5%, whereas 30% of patients who underwent THA and 32% of patients who underwent TKA had a BMI increase of >5%. Female sex among patients who underwent THA increased the odds of a >5% BMI increase at 10 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; p = 0.006). Older age among patients who underwent TKA decreased the odds of a >5% BMI increase at 10 years (OR per year, 0.95; p < 0.001).Although most patients experienced a BMI change of >5% at 10 years, the mean BMI did not meaningfully change 2, 5, or 10 years after THA or TKA. Arthroplasty should not be viewed as a gateway to BMI improvement for patients overall, but female sex and older age may predict clinically important weight changes 10 years after arthroplasty.Therapeutic Level III .

40938961,The Broken Wing Sign: A New Clinical Test to Detect Gluteus Medius Pathology with and without Fatty Infiltration.,"Gluteus medius tears and atrophy cause lateral hip pain, limp, and functional impairment. We developed the ""broken wing sign,"" a novel physical examination test for detecting gluteus medius tendon tears and muscle degeneration. This study evaluated its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative findings.We prospectively examined 59 patients (75 hips; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.8 years; 48 women) with suspected hip abductor insufficiency. The broken wing sign was tested with patients prone, the knee flexed at 90°, and the hip actively extended. A positive sign involved ≥10° of compensatory external hip rotation, visible as an inward drift of the foot, indicating gluteus medius (and resulting internal rotation) weakness. MRI served as the reference standard for classifying gluteus medius integrity as no tear, partial, full-thickness, or massive. Fatty infiltration was graded (Goutallier grades 0 to 4), quantified, and analyzed for a correlation with the examination findings. Diagnostic accuracy metrics were calculated.The broken wing sign demonstrated high accuracy (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 80.0%; positive predictive value [PPV], 91.8%; negative predictive value, 61.5%; diagnostic odds ratio, 17.8). An external rotation threshold of ≥30° yielded 100% specificity and 100% PPV for a tear. The sign detected acute tears with no or minimal fatty infiltration (100% sensitivity for massive tears). The degree of the external rotation angle was strongly correlated with muscle atrophy with fatty infiltration, showing 88.0% sensitivity for Goutallier grade ≥3 and 100% sensitivity for grade 4.The broken wing sign is clinically useful for diagnosing gluteus medius tendon tears and muscle atrophy, particularly massive tears and advanced fatty degeneration. It effectively guides MRI utilization and surgical planning, serving as a valuable initial diagnostic tool in the clinical setting.Diagnostic Level II .

40970766,Metronidazole exposure-response and safety in infants.,"The nitroimidazole antibiotic, metronidazole, is frequently prescribed to infants with serious intra-abdominal infections, and multiple dosing recommendations exist. We sought to evaluate the extent to which metronidazole doses and associated exposures achieved desired efficacy and safety in infants enrolled in the Antibiotic Safety in Infants with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (SCAMP) trial (NCT01994993). SCAMP participants received intravenous metronidazole as part of multimodal antimicrobial therapy. Participants received a 15 mg/kg loading dose and a 7.5 mg/kg maintenance dose at 24 h. A subsequent 7.5 mg/kg maintenance dose was administered every 12 h for participants of postmenstrual age (PMA) 23 to <34 weeks; 8 h for PMA 34-40 weeks; and 6 h for PMA >40 weeks. We evaluated associations between simulated metronidazole exposures and pre-specified surrogate pharmacodynamic targets and clinical outcomes of efficacy and safety. Nearly 100% of pharmacodynamic targets were met. Infants with therapeutic success (a composite efficacy outcome, defined as the absence of death, negative bacterial blood cultures, and presumptive clinical cure at 30 days) had higher Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, AUC00-24,ss, and AUCcum compared with infants without therapeutic success. However, the relationships between these exposure measures and therapeutic success were not significant in logistic regression analysis adjusting for gestational age. Despite generally high simulated exposures, no relationships were observed between exposures and prespecified safety events (necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal strictures, intestinal perforation, positive blood culture, seizures, death, and intraventricular hemorrhage).

41189469,Senotherapeutics for metabolic disease and diabetic complications.,"Metabolic diseases, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome, are increasingly prevalent worldwide, driven by sedentary lifestyles, aging populations, and complex genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally understood as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, a growing body of evidence now implicates cellular senescence as a central, age-related contributor to metabolic dysfunction. Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in key metabolic tissues where they disrupt tissue function through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic secretome. SASP factors exacerbate insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and tissue remodeling, advancing the progression and complications of metabolic diseases. These insights have catalyzed the development of senotherapeutics, a class of interventions that includes senolytics (to eliminate SCs), senomorphics (to suppress SASP), and senosensitizers (to render resistant SCs more vulnerable to clearance). Although preclinical studies show promise, translation into clinical practice faces significant challenges, including identifying reliable biomarkers, understanding SC heterogeneity, and optimizing treatment timing and safety. As research advances, senotherapeutics may offer a transformative approach not only to managing metabolic diseases but also to mitigating associated comorbidities. The recognition that antidiabetic agents already in clinical use can modulate key features of senescence highlights a unique translational opportunity, suggesting that prevention of age-related metabolic disorders may be achievable with therapies already available in routine clinical practice. Medicine is poised to enter a new era in which targeting cellular senescence could fundamentally reshape the prevention and treatment of age-related metabolic disorders, offering the potential for improved healthspan and reduced disease burden across the lifespan.© 2025 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.",Journal of internal medicine,"Nov 05, 2025",2025,Nov,05,Palmer A K|Spinelli R|Prata L G L|Chaib S|Suda M|Tchkonia T|Smith U|Kirkland J L,Palmer A K,"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.|Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.|Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.","Palmer A K, Spinelli R, Prata L G L, Chaib S, Suda M, Tchkonia T, Smith U, Kirkland J L",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41189469/,"The key finding of this research is that cellular senescence, a process where cells stop dividing, plays a central role in the development of metabolic diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes.

41190714,The Impact of Screw Density on Mechanical Complications in Lumbar Spine Deformity Constructs.,"Retrospective cohort study.To determine the impact of screw density on outcomes in adult spinal deformity surgery.Previous studies have suggested that decreased screw density in long lumbar constructs does not compromise mechanical robustness or increase the risk of complications such as PJK, pseudoarthrosis, or reoperation.We retrospectively identified adults who underwent spinal fusions with an upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) of L2 or above with a minimum 2-year radiographic follow up. We collected data on UIV, Hounsfield units based on CT scan, and radiographic parameters. Outcomes of interest included rod fracture, pseudarthrosis, proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK), proximal junctional failure (PJF), and overall reoperation. We performed a multivariate logistic regression on each outcome inclusive of all variables and dichotomized patients based on mean screw density into high and low screw density cohorts. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed for each outcome of interest to identify predictors of its occurrence. Patients were dichotomized into those with constructs ending at/above T9 (upper thoracic spine) or at/below T10 (lower thoracic spine) to determine if the impact of screw density was altered by construct length.We included 170 patients (mean age 66.8yr; mean screw density 1.83/level; mean radiographic follow-up 4.5 y). Fifty patients underwent reoperation (29%), with refractory pain (N=19) and symptomatic pseudoarthrosis (N=13) being the most common indications. Higher screw density was associated with lower odds of postoperative mechanical complications and reoperation for patients with lower thoracolumbar spine UIVs but not for those with upper thoracolumbar UIVs.Increased screw density may protect against mechanical complications in patients undergoing thoracolumbar fusion with UIV at or below T10. Lower screw density may be safe and cost-effective option for constructs terminating in the thoracic spine for adult spinal deformity surgery though further investigation is warranted.3.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

41192922,Characterization of Maternal and Fetal Immunity Following in Utero Spina Bifida Repair and Surgery-Induced Preterm Birth.,"Fetal surgery (FS) for spina bifida (SB) repair improves infant outcomes; however, spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is common. We aimed to evaluate maternal and fetal immune responses following FS for SB repair.Pregnant participants undergoing fetoscopic SB repair at 24-26 weeks of gestational age (GA) were prospectively recruited and compared to GA matched low-risk controls. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 2-week post-surgery (POD14), and delivery. Cytokine analysis, flow cytometry, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were performed.sPTB occurred in 5/6 of the FS group (0/6 of controls). Maternal blood in the FS group demonstrated increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and anti-inflammatory IL-1RA at baseline and POD14, increased pro-inflammatory IL-8 only post-operatively, and elevated growth factors throughout. T cell phenotypes following FS revealed reduced TH17 frequency but increased activation receptors on cytotoxic T cells. At delivery, the FS cohort had reduced Th2 and Th17 helper T cells and CD4+ memory T cells, but CD8 T cells still showed increased activation. No TCR expansion was detected post-surgery, suggesting antigen-independent activation. Cord blood in FS repaired neonates had increased AFP, IL-8, IL-1RA.Systemic immune changes following FS, particularly T cell maturation and activation, were observed. Further characterization of these mechanisms may help predict and prevent surgery-induced PTB, improving outcomes.© 2025 The Author(s).

41193385,Implantable peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of analgesic outcomes up to 24 months.,"Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) has emerged as a promising neurostimulation modality, yet its effectiveness and durability for chronic pain remain uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate changes in pain intensity following implantable PNS therapy.Eligible studies included adults (≥18 years) with chronic pain treated with an implantable PNS system, and pain intensity was assessed at baseline and follow-up time points. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity from baseline to 6 months after PNS implantation. Secondary outcomes included changes in pain intensity at 3, 12 and 24 months after PNS implantation. Standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) were pooled using a random-effects model.A total of 106 studies comprising 9272 patients were included. PNS was associated with large, statistically significant reductions in pain intensity from baseline to all time points: 3 months (Hedges' g 2.92; 95% CI 2.62 to 3.21), 6 months (Hedges' g 3.08; 95% CI 2.68 to 3.48), 12 months (Hedges' g 2.68; 95% CI 2.30 to 3.05) and 24 months (Hedges' g 2.08; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.48) (all p<0.001). However, the certainty of evidence as assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria was rated as low for the primary outcome, due to pooling from observational studies, risk of bias, and heterogeneity (statistical, clinical and methodological). Subgroup analyses revealed no differences by study design or device type, while smaller effect sizes were reported in industry-funded studies and those with declared conflicts of interest. The largest effect sizes were observed in pelvic and upper extremity pain, whereas the smallest in truncal pain.Implantable PNS provides persistent and clinically meaningful analgesia for chronic pain, with benefits sustained up to 24 months.

41193463,Functional genomics and tumor microenvironment analysis reveal prognostic biological subtypes in Mantle cell lymphoma.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous B-cell malignancy. We studied two MCL cohorts with differing treatment patterns: one enriched for immunochemotherapy, the other for chemotherapy alone. TP53 alterations are consistently associated with poor prognosis, whereas ATM mutations correlate with improved outcomes following rituximab-based chemotherapy. Based on recurrent genetic events, six clusters are identified and refined into three prognostic groups: high-risk (TP53 mutations and deletions at 17p13.3, 13q14.2, and 19p13.3), intermediate-risk (ATM and epigenetic regulator mutations, or gains at 8q/17q/15q), and low-risk (lacking TP53 alterations, rare ATM mutations without 11q deletions, gains at 3q, deletions at 6q). Transcriptomic analysis reveals enrichment of proliferation, metabolism-promoting gene signatures in high-risk; angiogenesis and NOTCH signaling in intermediate-risk; and proinflammatory-related (i.e., IFNα, TNFα) in low-risk MCLs. Multi-proteomic spatial profiling using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) demonstrates enrichment of CD4⁺ T cells with high expression of exhaustion markers and a dominant population of myeloid cells skewed toward an M2-like phenotype. Spatially, TP53-perturbed MCLs are immune-infiltrated yet exhausted, while ATM-perturbed cases remain immune-cold with dense tumors. Functional analysis shows that p53 represses BCR signaling through PTPN6 activation. Collectively, these findings highlight distinct molecular and immune landscapes and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities in high-risk TP53-perturbed MCL.© 2025.

41193794,"Insulin Rationing Persists Despite Policy Changes: Repeated Cross-Sectional Studies, 2017 vs 2024.","Insulin is a life-saving medication for people with diabetes, but access barriers, such as high costs, can result in rationing. Multiple policies have been introduced to limit insulin out-of-pocket costs over the past 5 years.To compare rates of cost-related insulin rationing among patients prescribed insulin in 2024 vs. 2017, and to examine broader insulin rationing due to cost-related barriers, insurance delays, or pharmacy shortage DESIGN: A 22-item cross-sectional survey conducted from April to July 2024 compared with a survey conducted from June to August 2017.Yale Diabetes Center PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes prescribed insulin, with 199 (60.1%) completing the survey in 2024 and 199 (56.2%) in 2017.Rates of cost-related insulin rationing and broader rationing due to access barriers, including cost, insurance delays, and pharmacy shortages.In 2024, among 199 respondents (mean age of 52.4 years, 47.7% female, 58.3% white, and 47.2% type 1 diabetes), 48 (24.1%) reported cost-related insulin rationing compared to 51 (25.5%) of 199 respondents in 2017 (p = 0.41). Characteristics of participants who reported cost-related insulin rationing were similar between 2024 and 2017, but with a higher proportion of adults with type 1 diabetes in 2024 (63.0%) compared to 2017 (43.1%, p = 0.05). In 2024, 75 participants (37.7%) reported insulin rationing due to cost, insurance delays, or pharmacy shortages.

41194256,Translational framework for implementation evaluation and research: a critical approach to patient-centred equity design.,"The field of implementation research has recently seen much interest in equity, with a strong emphasis on recognising and responding to disparities in care. Recent studies highlight the role of macro-level processes that translate meso-level institutional behaviours to micro-level healthcare practices, and that are generative of health and care inequities. They emphasise challenges patient-centredness and underscore the need for justice-oriented intervention design to address disparities and promote equitable care.To develop a patient-centred and justice-informed approach to the design of complex healthcare interventions and innovations in service delivery.Patient-centred Equity Design was developed in five stages. Sociological, public health, and implementation science theories explaining the generation of modifiable inequities were identified, and relevant explanatory constructs were extracted from them and organised into a determinant framework. Framework elements were then translated into (a) process models characterizing causal mechanisms of systemic inequities; (b) generative principles to guide equity- and patient-centred interventions and services; and (c) critical design questions to appraise the ways that inequities are embedded in healthcare interventions and services.Development work led to a determinant framework linking macro-level processes to meso- and micro-level healthcare inequities, and these were visualized in process models. The framework informed principles for the promotion of equitable, patient-centred interventions: fostering civility and dependability, ensuring clarity and continuity, and reducing workload and complexity. Four critical questions address relational inequalities, participation barriers, role expectations, and restitution for inequities. These were translated into proposed content for a simple appraisal tool to support the equitable design and evaluation of healthcare interventions and services.Patient-centred Equity Design integrates sociology, social justice, and implementation science to create equity-focused healthcare interventions. It offers a determinant framework, process models, generative principles, and critical questions to guide design. While not a validated tool, it enhances intervention development and service delivery, with potential for future Medical Research Council Framework integration. Patient- centred Equity Design provides actionable generative design principles to centre patient and caregiver experiences within intervention development, emphasizing restitution for inequities.© 2025.

39060006,Pain intensity and opioid consumption after temporary and permanent peripheral nerve stimulation: a 2-year multicenter analysis.,"Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is an emerging neuromodulation modality, yet there remains limited data highlighting its long-term effectiveness. The objective of this study was to report real-world data on pain intensity and opioid consumption after temporary and permanent PNS for chronic pain up to 24 months postimplantation.A retrospective study was conducted on all patients who received PNS implants at a multi-centered enterprise between January 1, 2014 and February 24, 2022. The two co-primary outcomes were: (1) change in pain intensity (11-point Numerical Rating Scale) from baseline to 12 months postimplant; and (2) comparison of the change in pain intensity between temporary and permanent PNS cohorts 12 months postimplant.126 patients were included in this analysis. Pain intensity significantly decreased 12 months postimplant in the overall cohort (mean difference (MD) -3.0 (95% CI -3.5 to -2.4), p<0.0001). No significant difference in this reduction was identified between temporary and permanent PNS cohorts (MD 0.0 (95% CI -1.1 to 1.0), p=1.00) 12 months postimplantation. Pain intensity significantly decreased in the overall, temporary, and permanent cohorts at all secondary time points (3, 6, and 24 months). No change in daily opioid consumption was observed at 6 and 12 months postimplant in the overall cohort.This study found that both temporary and permanent PNS may be effective for reducing pain intensity in patients with chronic pain up to 24 months postimplantation, although no changes in opioid consumption were observed. The decrease in pain intensity was comparable between patients receiving temporary versus permanent implants, highlighting that temporary PNS may achieve long-lasting clinical benefits. However, given the substantial loss to follow-up, further large-scale studies are needed to solidify conclusions about the efficacy of PNS.© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2025.
