41189046,Assessing and Resolving Findings of Sex Chromosome Discordance in Genetic Testing.,"X and Y chromosome analysis is a critical component of genetic testing, used both diagnostically and as a quality control (QC) metric. Discordances between expected and observed sex chromosome data can arise due to mislabeling, demographic data errors, transplant history, or biological variations. Such discordances pose challenges to laboratories and affect patient care, particularly in marginalized populations and unique clinical contexts.We reviewed cases of sex chromosome discordance identified at our laboratory from January 2021 through August 2023. Cases spanned various testing methods and were categorized by the root cause, including mislabeling, sample mix-ups, transgender individuals, stem cell transplants, and unexplained causes. Case outcomes were assessed, and potential resolutions were analyzed.Among 65 cases identified, the leading cause of discordance was mislabeling (n = 20, 31%), followed by other/not identified (n = 16, 25%), sample mix-ups (n = 13, 20%), transgender individuals (n = 9, 14%), and stem cell transplants (n = 7, 11%). Cases required additional QC processes such as reanalysis, clinician contact, and occasionally sample re-collection. The process extended turnaround times by up to 13 business days. Detailed case reviews highlighted the challenges and implications of managing these discordances, emphasizing the importance of accurate data transmission and inclusive practices.Using X and Y chromosome data as a QC metric can identify critical errors but also introduces limitations and bias. Improved standardization, inclusive practices, and alternative QC methods are necessary to ensure accuracy and equitable patient care. Collaborative efforts are required to address demographic complexities and reduce testing delays.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025. All rights reserved.

41186273,Role of Xylitol Nasal Irrigation in the Management of Chronic Sinusitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Xylitol, a low-permeability sugar alcohol, is recommended for treating chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) due to its ability to decrease liquid salt concentration at the airway surface. This study investigated the efficacy of xylitol nasal irrigation for the management of CRS and its postoperative care.We analysed 7 studies with 263 participants after reviewing the studies that were retrieved from PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases up to December 2024. Those comparing changes in endoscopic score, Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT), Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE), olfactory dysfunction, and CRS-related visual analogue scale from baseline to post-treatment between xylitol and normal saline nasal irrigation groups were analysed.Nasal irrigation with xylitol significantly improved sinonasal well-being in CRS patients compared to irrigation with saline (SMD 0.6253, 95% CI [0.0067; 1.2438]; I2 = 0.0%). Patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery showed substantial SNOT improvement (SMD 3.1284, 95% CI [0.5229; 5.7338]; I2 = 86.1%), while no significant changes were observed in non-ESS patients (SMD 0.2571, 95% CI [-0.4872; 1.0014]). The xylitol group also showed significant improvements in NOSE (SMD 0.5976, 95% CI [0.2297; 0.9656]; I2 = 49.3%) and SNOT scores (SMD 0.3608, 95% CI [0.0724; 0.6493]; I2 = 49.1%). However, there were no significant changes in endoscopic scoring (SMD 0.1309, 95% CI [-0.1777; 0.4396]; I2 = 0.0%), olfaction (SMD -0.0292, 95% CI [-0.3633; 0.3050]; I2 = 0.0%), or saccharine clearance time (SMD 0.3816, 95% CI [-0.3816; 1.1449]; I2 = 61.6%). Xylitol irrigation was well tolerated, with minimal, transient side effects and no significant adverse events.Nasal irrigation with xylitol significantly improves the subjective management of CRS and postoperative care compared to saline irrigation but does not alter objective outcomes.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Clin Otolaryngol,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Kang Y J|Stybayeva G|Hwang S H,Stybayeva G,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.","Kang Y J, Stybayeva G, Hwang S H",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41186273/,"Nasal irrigation with xylitol, a low-permeability sugar alcohol, significantly improves the subjective management of chronic sinusitis and postoperative care compared to saline irrigation, but does not significantly change objective outcomes like endoscopic scores or olfaction.

40850932,Post-Translationally Modified Proteoforms as Biomarkers: From Discovery to Clinical Use.,"Protein biomarkers are routinely measured for disease diagnosis and prognosis in clinical laboratories. Since most assays focus on protein quantity, information about proteoforms is often not acquired. Proteoforms of a protein represent the complex integration of genetic polymorphism, alternative splicing of RNA transcripts, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the amino-acid backbone. A detailed analysis of the post-translationally modified proteoforms (PTMPs), which are influenced by pathophysiological conditions, may lead to more precise diagnosis and prognosis.This article first discusses the methodologies used to accurately detect and characterize PTMPs, i.e., immunoassays, electrophoresis, chromatography, and intact and proteolysis-aided mass spectrometry techniques. Then it reviews specific examples of PTMP biomarkers that have been successfully translated from biomarker discovery to clinical use. The examples include β2-transferrin for cerebrospinal fluid leak diagnosis, phosphorylated tau proteoforms for Alzheimer disease diagnosis, and fucosylated alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis. In addition, the article provides prospective views of novel analytical technologies and promising new PTMP biomarkers entering clinical practice.In summary, PTMs are controlled by biochemical processes to modulate the functions of proteins by expanding their chemical diversity. PTM alterations in proteins can be indicators for pathophysiological conditions. Advances in analytical technologies are deepening our understanding of PTMPs and paving the way for their translation to clinical use. As research continues to discover the clinical meaning of PTMP biomarkers, they are poised to become valuable additions to the clinical testing menu for precision medicine.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.

40878676,Microvascular Endothelial Cells License APS Vasculopathy Through YAP1- and CCN2-Mediated Signaling.,"Whereas antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is best known for increasing the risk of macrovascular thrombosis, APS vasculopathy is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to occlusion of small blood vessels in the skin, kidneys, and heart, among other organs. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and targeted treatment options for patients with APS are lacking.To identify and analyze APS microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), skin biopsies of patients with APS complicated by livedo racemosa were characterized using single-cell RNA sequencing. CCN1 (cellular communication network factor 1) and CCN2 were identified in skin and kidney biopsies by immunofluorescence microscopy and in plasma by ELISA. Healthy dermal MVECs were cultured with APS patient-derived serum or immunoglobulin G (IgG), and relevant signaling pathways were characterized using quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells were determined after exposure to conditioned medium from APS IgG-stimulated MVECs. A mouse model of APS IgG-accelerated neointima formation was developed. Anti-CCN2 monoclonal antibodies were tested in vascular smooth muscle cell functional assays and the mouse model.Increased endothelial cell expression of CCN1 and CCN2 was identified by single-cell RNA sequencing and further confirmed in APS skin by microscopy as well as in APS plasma by ELISA. Exposure of healthy MVECs to patient IgG triggered the upregulation of CCN1 and CCN2 via Toll-like receptor 4- and YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1)-mediated signaling. CCN2, originating from APS IgG-stimulated MVECs led to the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, phenotypes that were inhibited by an anti-CCN2 antibody or depletion of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). We further observed increased expression of CCN2, along with evidence of YAP1 nuclear translocation, in kidney vessels of APS nephropathy biopsies. Finally, CCN2 inhibition with an anti-CCN2 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced neointima thickening and cell proliferation in a mouse model of APS IgG-accelerated neointima formation.This study revealed activation of YAP1-mediated signaling in APS dermal microvessels and demonstrated that the YAP1 target CCN2 plays a role in facilitating pro-proliferative communication between MVECs and vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings offer insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying APS vasculopathy, providing potential therapeutic targets for patients.",Circulation,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Shi H|Liang W|Yang Z|Hoy C K|Wang Q|Ding Z|Pan H|Shi Y|Shen Y|Sarosh C|Yalavarthi S|Kapoor P|Hudgins L|Vance C E|Wasikowski R|Figueroa-Parra G|Tambralli A|Madison J A|Tsoi L C|Gudjonsson J E|Yang C|Duarte-García A|Zuo Y|Billi A C|Tsou P|Knight J S,Figueroa-Parra G|Duarte-García A,"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Ruijin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (H.S., Z.Y., Z.D., H.P., C.Y.).|Departments of Internal Medicine (H.S., W.L., C.K.H., Y.

40899684,Modern Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Formulas Outperform Direct Methods in Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia and Low Levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.,"Direct measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is widely used and recommended by professional society guidelines despite its potential limitations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low LDL-C. This study evaluated the performance of 3 direct LDL-C (LDL-CD) assays, 2 modern LDL-C calculation methods [LDL-C Martin (LDL-CM), LDL-C modified Sampson (LDL-CS)] and the conventional Friedewald (LDL-CF) method against the reference method, beta-quantification (LDL-CBQ).A total of 181 remnant sera from patients with standard lipid panel orders or from patients with LDL-CBQ orders with triglycerides (TG) ≥ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L), or with TG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L) and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) were included. LDL-CD and lipid panel data were gathered from Abbott Alinity, Roche Cobas, and Siemens Atellica platforms.LDL-CD among the 3 platforms showed a median CV of 11.2%. In patients with TG <400 mg/dL, LDL-CM and LDL-CS demonstrated less bias and less misclassification at the clinical decision LDL-C levels than LDL-CF or LDL-CD. In the 400 to 800 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) TG group, LDL-CS was superior to LDL-CD or LDL-CM in accuracy. When TG is ≥ 800 mg/dL, LDL-CD (Roche) showed substantial bias from LDL-CBQ while LDL-CS (Roche) showed smaller but significant bias.In summary, LDL-CD or LDL-CF showed little advantage over the 2 modern LDL-C calculation methods. LDL-CS showed the best overall correlation with LDL-CBQ and therefore is recommended to replace LDL-CF and potentially LDL-CD when making clinical decisions in patients with low LDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia.© Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.

Subjects self-administered either CD or MD for 12 weeks, then crossed over to the alternate treatment for an additional 12 weeks. The primary outcome was IOP at 12 weeks compared to baseline at enrollment. Secondary outcomes included running out of drops (premature bottle exhaustion or PBE), adverse effects (AEs), and subjective evaluations of the device's usability.Twenty-nine subjects completed the study. MD significantly decreased IOP from baseline by 1.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.88 to 2.29), compared to a CD (0.13 mm Hg, 95% CI: -0.26 to 0.52). Incidence of PBE decreased from 83% with CD to 17% with MD. AEs were reduced from 83% of subjects reporting at least one AE with CD versus 62% with MD. Most found MD easy to administer and believed it helped prevent eyedrop waste.MD delivered with the Nanodropper adaptor provided additional IOP-L, significantly reduced PBE, and decreased the occurrence and severity of non-systemic AEs compared to CD in this cohort of stable POAG/OHT subjects. MD use among glaucoma subjects may enhance tolerability, improve adherence, and long-term IOP control.Copyright © 2025 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS.",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Steger J S|Capó-Aponte J E|Papp A|Schulte A J|Grewal E P|Song A J|Colantuoni E|Kelstrom J C|Robin A L,Steger J S|Grewal E P|Song A J,"Nanodropper, Inc.

41186417,Technical systematic review supporting 2025 AASLD Practice Guidelines on management of chronic hepatitis B.,"With rapid changes in the management landscape of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), this technical systematic review addresses four critical Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions to provide guidance to the formulation of recommendations to the 2025 AASLD practice guidelines for management of CHB.The review was reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58-101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79-797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Pan C Q|Saadi S|Ghany M G|Feld J J|Lim J K|Kim A Y|Tang A S|Nguyen M H|Sulkowski M S|Terrault N A|Lok A S|Hegazi M|Hasan B|Fleti F|Nayfeh T|Abusalih M F|Seisa M O|Kabbara Allababidi A|Abbas A S|Prokop L J|Murad M H|Mohammad K S,Saadi S|Hegazi M|Hasan B|Fleti F|Nayfeh T|Abusalih M F|Seisa M O|Kabbara Allababidi A|Abbas A S|Prokop L J|Murad M H|Mohammad K S,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.|Mayo Clinic Evidence-based Practice Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Clinical Hepatology Research Section, Liver Diseases Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.|Toronto Centre for Liver Disease, University Health Network, Canada.|Section of Digestive Diseases and Yale Liver Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.|Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.|Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.|North East Medical Services, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.|Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.|Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.|Division of Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.|Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.|Preventive Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic Children's, Rochester, MN, USA.","Pan C Q, Saadi S, Ghany M G, Feld J J, Lim J K, Kim A Y, Tang A S, Nguyen M H, Sulkowski M S, Terrault N A, Lok A S, Hegazi M, Hasan B, Fleti F, Nayfeh T, Mohammad K S, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41186417/,"This systematic review provides guidance for the 2025 AASLD practice guidelines on managing chronic hepatitis B.

41187984,Modeling the Effect of Glucagon on Endogenous Glucose Production in Healthy Individuals under Meal-like Conditions.,"Defective postprandial glucagon suppression contributes to chronic hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. While insulin action and secretion have been extensively and quantitatively studied in the literature, less effort has been made to quantify the glucagon stimulatory effect on endogenous glucose production (EGP). This study aims to model the glucagon effect on EGP in healthy humans, capturing the decline of its action following sustained hyperglucagonemia. We analyzed data from 54 nondiabetic individuals studied on two occasions, where they received a glucose, labeled with [3-3H]-glucose, and an insulin infusion, mimicking systemic appearance after an oral glucose challenge, while endogenous hormone secretion was suppressed by somatostatin. Glucagon was infused at a rate of 0.65 ng/kg/min starting at 0 min (non-suppressed occasion) or 120 min to mimic postprandial glucagon suppression (suppressed occasion). Plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations were frequently measured for 300 min, and model-independent estimates of EGP were obtained from tracer-specific activity. Several physiological models describing the EGP time course as a function of plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations were developed and compared, each implementing a different hypothesis for the evanescence of glucagon effect. The best model successfully described EGP using the glucagon-to-insulin ratio and over basal glucose to account for the waning glucagon effect. The model precisely estimated hepatic glucagon and insulin sensitivities. However, the glucose effect was excessively delayed, likely reflecting a cascade of other biological signals rather than the direct effect of hyperglycemia on the liver.","American journal of physiology.

41186418,AASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B.,"Accumulating data related to prevention, surveillance and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) provided the impetus for this updated guideline, using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.The guideline was developed in compliance with the National Academy of Medicine standards. The guideline panel developed structured questions following the Population, Intervention Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework. The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics.

Participants with diabetes, body mass index >35 kg/m2, coronary artery calcium score >50 Agatston Units, and other cardiometabolic disease risk indicators were excluded from enrollment. In the ancillary KEEPS-Cog study, cognitive tests were completed at baseline, 18-, 36-, and 48-month post-randomization. In these analyses, cognitive variables were summarized as four cognitive domain-specific factor scores: verbal learning and memory, auditory attention and working memory, visual attention and executive function, and speeded language and mental flexibility. Waist-hip-ratio (WHR), an indicator of central adiposity, was measured at screening (baseline) and modeled as a covariate in linear latent growth models assessing associations of MHT with cognitive functions at baseline and over time.Higher baseline WHR was associated with poorer performance on all domain-specific cognitive outcomes at baseline and with changes in visual attention and executive function across time. Models including interaction effects were not significant for either o-CEE x WHR or t-E2 x WHR.Central adiposity is a risk factor for domain-specific cognitive decline, and thus, cognitive health effects should be investigated in early postmenopausal women, even in women with low cardiovascular risk statuses.","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,James T T|Dowling N M|Ferrer Simó C|Salazar H|Van Hulle C A|Ennis G|Johnson A L|Wyman M F|McLester-Davis L W Y|Gooding D C|Fischer B|Bouges S|Umucu E|Kara F|Kling J M|Manson J E|Brinton E A|Cedars M I|Lobo R A|Neal-Perry G|Santoro N F|Naftolin F|Harman S M|Pal L|Miller V M|Kantarci K|Gleason C E,Kara F|Kling J M,"University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.|George Washington University, Washington, DC.|University of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing, Pittsburgh, PA.|Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, W.S.

41186779,A Feature Extraction and Selection Framework for Electrocorticography-Based Neural Activity Classification.,"Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals provide a valuable window into neural activity, yet their complex structure makes reliable classification challenging. This study addresses the problem by proposing a feature-selective framework that integrates multiple feature extraction techniques with statistical feature selection to improve classification performance. Power spectral density, wavelet-based features, Shannon entropy, and Hjorth parameters were extracted from ECoG signals obtained during a visual task. The most informative features were then selected using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and classification was performed with several machine learning methods, including decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy across individual patients as well as the combined dataset, with clear separability between classes confirmed through t-SNE visualization. In addition, analysis of selected features highlights the prominent role of electrodes located near the visual cortex, providing insights into the spatial distribution of neural activity.© 2025.

41187016,Lung Transplant Outcomes Following Treatment of Pre-Transplant MAC Pulmonary Infection.,"Treating Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection pre-lung transplant (LT) can be challenging to treat, given prolonged therapy and side effects. The impact of pre-transplant MAC treatment on recurrence and outcomes post-LT remains unclear, especially in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have a median survival of less than 2 years.We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult LT patients at the Mayo Clinic who had positive MAC sputum cultures pre-LT. The cohort was stratified and compared based on the type of treatment (complete, partial, or no treatment) for MAC pulmonary infection. The primary outcome was MAC recurrence post-LT, and secondary outcomes were mortality, FEV-1, and FVC at 1-year post-LT.Among the cohort of 47 patients, 9 (19.1%) were partially treated and 11 (23.4%) were completely treated for MAC infection pre-LT. Post-transplant MAC pulmonary infection recurrence occurred in eight (17%) of the total cohort, with four (14.8%) in the non-treated, four (44.4%) in the partially-treated, and none (0%) in the completely treated patients (p = 0.026). There was no difference in mortality in patients who had MAC recurrence post-transplantation (13% vs. 9.7%, p > 0.9) and those who were completely or partially treated, compared to non-treated (0% vs. 13% vs. 13%, p > 0.9). The FEV1 and FVC at 1-year post-LT did not differ by the pre-transplant treatment or post-transplant MAC recurrence status.The role of treatment for MAC infection pre-transplant is questionable, especially in patients with diseases like ILD who may not have enough wait time to complete therapy.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Transpl Infect Dis,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Balasubramanian P|Khanijo A|White B A|Corro R|Alvarez F|Narula T|Bag R|Pennington K|Thomas M|Haney J|Makey I|Bosch W|Brumble L|Johnson M|Shah S Z|Baz M A,Balasubramanian P|Khanijo A|White B A|Corro R|Alvarez F|Narula T|Bag R|Pennington K|Thomas M|Haney J|Makey I|Bosch W|Brumble L|Johnson M|Shah S Z|Baz M A,"Department of Transplantation, Division of Lung Failure and Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Transplantation, Division of Lung Failure and Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.|Department of Pulmonary, Allergy and Sleep, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.","Balasubramanian P, Khanijo A, White B A, Corro R, Alvarez F, Narula T, Bag R, Pennington K, Thomas M, Haney J, Makey I, Bosch W, Brumble L, Johnson M, Shah S Z, Baz M A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41187016/,"The key finding of this medical research is that complete treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection before lung transplant can reduce the risk of MAC recurrence after the transplant, but it does not significantly impact mortality or lung function.

41187097,2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.© 2025 American College of Rheumatology.","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)","Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Sammaritano L R|Askanase A|Bermas B L|Dall'Era M|Duarte-García A|Hiraki L T|Son M B F|Werth V P|Aranow C|Barnado A|Broder A|Brunner H I|Chong B F|Chowdhary V R|Hersh A O|Izmirly P M|Jules M|Kalunian K|Kamen D|Rubinstein T B|Smith B J|Smith N M|Thomas A|Timlin H|Wallace D J|Azzam M|Bartels C M|Cunha J S|DeQuattro K|Fava A|Figueroa-Parra G|Garg S|Gomes L L A|Cuéllar-Gutiérrez M C|Iyer P|Johannemann A S|Jorge A|Kasturi S|Kawtharany H|Khawandi J|Legge A|Liang K P|Lockwood M M|Sanchez-Rodriguez A|Turgunbaev M|Williams J N|Turner A S|Mustafa R A,Duarte-García A|Figueroa-Parra G|Cuéllar-Gutiérrez M C|Sanchez-Rodriguez A,"Hospital for Special Surgery Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.|Columbia University, New York, New York.|University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.|University of California, San Francisco.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.|University of Pennsylvania and Corporal Michael J.

41187273,Poor Outcomes of Lateral Tibial Plateau Fractures in Women Aged 50 and Older: A Case Series.,"This study assessed the long-term clinical outcomes of women (≥50 years of age) who undergo operative management of lateral tibial plateau fractures, with particular focus on risk of conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA).A retrospective review was conducted on female patients aged 50 and older who sustained lateral tibial plateau fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) at a level 1 trauma center between January 2003 and July 2023. The primary outcome measure was conversion to TKA. Secondary outcome measures included lateral joint subsidence, arthrosis progression, surgical complications, and reoperations for any reason.Forty-one women underwent ORIF of lateral tibial plateau fractures during the study period with an average age of 63.5 ± 9.0 years. The mechanism of injury for most patients was a ground-level fall (n = 24, 58.5%). At final follow-up, lateral joint subsidence was present in 22 women (53.7%), and patients progressed an average of 1.0 Kellgren-Lawrence grade in terms of arthrosis. A total of 7 women (17.1%) underwent conversion to TKA at a mean of 4.0 years after ORIF.Women 50 years and older demonstrated a 17.1% rate of conversion to TKA following operative management of laterally impacted tibial plateau fractures, more than two times higher than rates seen in the general population affected by these fractures.

40629956,A Modified Sampson-NIH Equation with Improved Accuracy for Estimating Low Levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol.,"Cardiovascular guidelines have long recommended low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary target for lipid-lowering therapy. Recent guidelines have emphasized the importance of achieving low LDL-C levels; hence, the accurate measurement of low LDL-C is increasingly clinically relevant.Using lipid panel test results from the Mayo Clinic (n = 24 590) and the FOURIER clinical trial of evolocumab (n = 9605), the following modified Sampson equation was developed by least-squares regression to match LDL-C (mg/dL) by the β-quantification reference method, by combining terms into non High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (nonHDLC = Total Cholesterol - High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) and forcing the coefficient to be one.The modified Sampson equation demonstrated significant improvement in its concordance to the reference method compared to other equations (the Lin Concordance Correlation Coefficient 0.992, P < 0.001). By overall kappa analysis, it showed the best agreement to the reference method at the 55 mg/dL cutpoint (1.4 mmol/L, 0.98 [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 0.96, Martin-Hopkins: 0.96, Friedewald: 0.94) and the 70 mg/dL cutpoint (1.8 mmol/L, 0.97 [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 0.94, Martin-Hopkins: 0.95, Friedewald: 0.92). The false classification rate of the modified Sampson equation was also significantly lower compared to the other equations at 55 mg/dL (15%, [P < 0.001], Sampson-NIH: 29%, Martin-Hopkins: 28%, Friedewald: 37%) and 70 mg/dL (18%, [P < 0.001]; Sampson-NIH: 30%, Martin-Hopkins: 28.%, Friedewald: 34%). The new equation increases the percentage of correctly classified patients with low LDL-C by approximately 10% to 20% over the other equations based on its net reclassification index.The modified Sampson equation shows improved accuracy compared to other equations for low LDL-C. It more accurately identifies high-risk patients, who are not at their LDL-C goals and could benefit from more intensive lipid-lowering therapy.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2025.",Clinical chemistry,"Nov 04, 2025",2025,Nov,04,Sampson M|Zubiran R|Wolska A|Meeusen J W|Donato L J|Jaffe A S|Melloni G E M|Giugliano R P|Sabatine M S|Marston N A|Remaley A T,Meeusen J W|Donato L J|Jaffe A S,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.|Lipoprotein Metabolism Laboratory, Translational Vascular Medicine Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.|TIMI Study Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.","Sampson M, Zubiran R, Wolska A, Meeusen J W, Donato L J, Jaffe A S, Melloni G E M, Giugliano R P, Sabatine M S, Marston N A, Remaley A T",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40629956/,"The researchers developed a modified Sampson-NIH equation that more accurately estimates low levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to other equations.
