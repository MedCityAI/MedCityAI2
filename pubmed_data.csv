41312564,Evaluation of platelet dense granules by transmission electron microscopy in healthy pediatric donors and pediatric patients with suspected platelet disorders.,"Whole mount (WM) platelet transmission electron microscopy (PTEM) is a standard method for evaluating platelet dense granules (DG). However, because of the lack of a pediatric/adolescent mean DG/platelet reference range (RR), the prevalence of platelet DG deficiency in patients with suspected inherited platelet disorders (IPD) is mostly unknown in our practice. This study aimed to establish a local pediatric/adolescent RR for mean DG/platelet in a cohort of pediatric patients with clinical suspicion of IPD, which was used to determine the prevalence and clinical and laboratory features of platelet DG deficiency.WM-PTEM was performed on healthy donors. The mean DG/platelet RR was calculated by averaging the DG of 100 platelets per donor. Patients who underwent laboratory evaluation of suspected IPD were evaluated. PTEM results, clinical histories, other laboratory testing results, and pediatric ISTH BAT scores (normal < 3; abnormal ≥3) were collected and analyzed.Healthy donors (n = 77, 41.6% female), ages 3-18 years, had a mean of 2.7 DG/platelet (±0.5), ranging from 1.9 to 3.8 per platelet. The mean DG/platelet did not correlate with age or gender. The tentative RR was calculated to be 1.9 to 3.8 DG/platelet. Of the 72 patients with suspected IPD (age 3-18 years, 69.4% female), 31 patients had BAT scores < 3 and 41 patients had BAT scores ≥3 (range 0-11). Eighteen patients (25%) were diagnosed with DG deficiency. The mean DG/platelet in patients with bleeding scores ≥3 vs. those with bleeding scores < 3 was similar. There was no difference in the number of patients with normal or abnormal bleeding scores in groups with normal vs decreased mean DG/platelet (p = .42) based on the pediatric DG/platelet RR. Platelet DG deficiency was also not correlated with abnormal platelet function testing results.Approximately 25% of pediatric patients with suspected IPD were found to have platelet DG deficiency. However, the mean DG/platelet did not correlate with the ISTH BAT scores or platelet function testing results.",Platelets,"Dec, 2025",2025,Dec,,Greenmyer J R|Chen D|Howell K G|Fischer K M|Johnson B|Drapeau N|Stromback L R|Charlesworth J E|Gossman S C|Gamez J D|Pruthi R K|Warad D M,Greenmyer J R|Chen D|Howell K G|Fischer K M|Johnson B|Drapeau N|Stromback L R|Charlesworth J E|Gossman S C|Gamez J D|Pruthi R K|Warad D M,"Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN USA.|Special Coagulation Laboratory, Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Electron Microscopy Core Facility, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Greenmyer J R, Chen D, Howell K G, Fischer K M, Johnson B, Drapeau N, Stromback L R, Charlesworth J E, Gossman S C, Gamez J D, Pruthi R K, Warad D M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41312564/,"This study established a reference range for the number of dense granules in platelets of healthy pediatric and adolescent donors.

41315206,The impact of extramedullary and paraskeletal plasmacytomas on treatment outcomes in multiple myeloma treated with teclistamab: U.S. Myeloma Immunotherapy Consortium real-world experience.,"Teclistamab, a bispecific antibody targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), is effective in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but its impact on patients with soft tissue plasmacytomas is unclear. We studied 385 RRMM patients treated with teclistamab at 13 U.S. centers through September 2023, with follow-up to April 2024. Soft tissue plasmacytomas were classified as true extramedullary disease (EMD; not contiguous with bone) or paraskeletal plasmacytomas (PSK; contiguous with bone). Patients with the simultaneous presence of both were classified as true-EMD, reflecting its adverse prognosis. Of those, 109 (28%) had true EMD, 33 (9%) had PSK, and 243 (63%) had no soft tissue plasmacytoma (No-STP). Median follow-up was 9.9 months. Overall response rates were 38% in true-EMD, 54.1% in PSK, and 62.4% in No-STP (p < 0.001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.4 months in true-EMD, 6.51 months in PSK, and 8.95 months in No-STP (p < 0.0001). Median overall survival (OS) was 9.54 months for true EMD, 13.1 months for PSK, and not reached in No-STP (p = 0.00012). In multivariable analysis, true-EMD was independently associated with inferior PFS and OS, while PSK showed numerically lower outcomes. These findings highlight the need for tailored strategies in patients with soft tissue plasmacytomas, particularly those with true-EMD.© 2025.

41315020,Measurement congruence between record data and retrospective self-report measures of child maltreatment: do positive childhood experiences affect discrepancies?,"Discrepancies between retrospective self-reports and official record data of child maltreatment (CM) are well-documented, yet few studies have examined how newer self-report instruments compare with record data or what factors influence inconsistencies across methods. This study addresses two primary aims: (1) to provide the first concordance estimates between prospective child protective services (CPS) records and the maltreatment and abuse chronology of exposure (MACE), a widely used retrospective CM assessment tool; and (2) to examine the influence of positive childhood experiences on discrepancies in CM assessment.We utilize two maltreatment cohorts in which adults and adolescents with documented histories of CM and matched nonmaltreated controls were enrolled. Both cohorts included CM data from CPS records coded with the maltreatment classification system (MCS) and retrospective self-reports of CM and measures of positive childhood experiences. The cohorts vary in age at retrospective assessment (adults vs. adolescents), retrospective time lag (long vs. short), used different self-report measures (MACE vs. CTQ), and different methods for assessing positive experiences (explicit self-report vs. ratings of unconscious content). The rigorous dual-study design ensures findings are robust to study- and measurement-specific differences.Findings revealed minimal agreement between MACE self-reports and MCS-coded CPS records for maltreatment occurring from ages 0-12. Discrepancies were primarily driven by retrospective reports of CM not documented in official records. Importantly, in both studies, individuals with more positive childhood experiences were less likely to self-report maltreatment (via MACE or CTQ) that was documented based on official records.Findings suggest that positive childhood experiences may help facilitate resilience among CM survivors by influencing memory and appraisal of childhood events. Clinical interventions that explore autobiographical memories may be particularly effective in mitigating the psychopathology sequelae of maltreatment.© 2025 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Nov 28, 2025",2025,Nov,28,Russotti J|Warmingham J M|Levin R Y|Hutson L|Swerbenski H|Cicchetti D|Handley E D,Russotti J|Warmingham J M|Levin R Y|Hutson L|Swerbenski H|Cicchetti D|Handley E D,"Mt.

41313544,One Subcutaneous 2-ml Injection of Mirikizumab is Bioequivalent to Two 1-ml Subcutaneous Injections in Healthy Participants.,"Mirikizumab, an anti-interleukin-23 p19 monoclonal antibody, is approved for treating adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. For ulcerative colitis maintenance therapy, mirikizumab is administered via two 1-ml subcutaneous (SC) injections. Volume and number of SC administrations can impact injection site reactions and local pain, as well as treatment compliance. We assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety comparability of an investigational one 2-ml SC injection compared with the commercially available two 1-ml SC injections.In this phase 1 study, USA-based healthy adults were stratified by weight and randomized (1:1) to receive citrate-free 200 mg SC mirikizumab as either two 1-ml injections (each 100 mg) or one 2-ml (200 mg) injection, delivered by an autoinjector. Participants in each arm were subrandomized by injection site location (arm, abdomen, or thigh). Blood sampling and safety assessments were conducted up to 10 weeks post dose. The primary endpoint was PK, and the secondary endpoint was safety.A total of 244 participants received one injection and 240 received two injections (mean age 42.5 years; 51.0% female). Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Primary PK parameters fell within the bioequivalence range (geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio 0.800-1.250). Observed GLSMs were consistent across injection site locations. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48 participants with one injection (19.7%) and 55 with two injections (22.9%); most were mild (62/74 events with one injection [83.8%] and 85/100 with two injections [85.0%]). No serious adverse events were reported in either group.Mirikizumab 200 mg administered as one 2-ml SC injection was bioequivalent to two 1-ml injections, and most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in both groups.

41313540,Finerenone Versus Spironolactone for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet comparative effectiveness between steroidal and nonsteroidal agents remains unknown. Our aim was to compare cardiovascular and safety outcomes associated with finerenone versus spironolactone among patients with HFpEF.This retrospective cohort study used a global federated health research network to identify adults with new-onset HFpEF between January 1, 2021, and August 1, 2025. Propensity score matching (1:1) balanced baseline characteristics, and outcomes were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 253 patients prescribed finerenone and 32,266 prescribed spironolactone were identified; after matching, 251 patients were retained in each cohort (mean age, 73 years; 47% female). The primary outcome was acute HF events. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalizations, mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events. Safety outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia.Acute HF events occurred in 6.0% of patients receiving finerenone and 4.4% receiving spironolactone (HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.58-2.74). All-cause mortality was lower with finerenone (4.4% vs. 8.0%; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-1.00). Other clinical and safety outcomes, including MACE (11.6% vs. 10.8%), AKI (10.4% vs. 8.0%), and hyperkalemia (5.8% vs. 6.2%), were similar between groups.In this first direct comparison of MRAs in HFpEF, finerenone demonstrated broadly comparable effectiveness and safety to spironolactone. While these observations are hypothesis-generating, prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and inform therapeutic decision-making.© 2025.

41313463,Diagnostic utility of additional spine imaging for syrinx detection in the pre-operative assessment of pediatric Chiari malformation type 1.,"Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is sometimes associated with syringomyelia, most often in the cervical spine. Many clinicians pursue additional spine imaging to identify syrinxes; however, this imaging in pediatric CM1 patients often requires general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, with significant risk and cost considerations.We aim to determine the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of additional spine imaging for syrinx detection in surgical pediatric CM1 patients.We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of all pediatric CM1 patients who underwent surgical Chiari decompression at our institution over a 20-year period. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of brain MRIs alone for syrinx detection and the diagnostic yield of additional spine MRIs in brain MRI syrinx-negative patients were assessed.One hundred and fifty-nine CM1 pediatric patients underwent surgical Chiari decompression at our institution from 2001 to 2020. Forty-four patients had a syrinx as determined by both brain and spine MRI, but 41 (93.2%) were identifiable on brain MRI alone. Therefore, brain MRIs had a sensitivity of 93.2% and an NPV of 93.3% for syrinx detection. Spine MRIs in patients with syrinx-negative brain MRIs had a diagnostic yield of 6.7%. Thirty-five (40.7%) of the patients with both brain and spine MRI's required general anesthesia for spine MRI.Our retrospective cohort study demonstrates clinicians should consider the high sensitivity and NPV of brain MRIs and the low diagnostic yield, cost, and anesthesia-related risks of additional spine imaging for syrinxes in pediatric CM1 patients.© 2025.

41313338,Evaluation and management of male sexual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: A clinical road map.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with multiple manifestations including both motor and non-motor symptoms. One manifestation of PD that is often overlooked is the sexual dysfunction (SD) that patients may experience. Individuals with PD can experience impairment in sexual desire, arousal or lubrication, orgasm, ejaculation, pain and the physical aspect of intimacy. This article aims to provide an overview of the current practices in the evaluation and treatment of sexual dysfunction in men in the context PD. Note that this article focuses on the male population as it reviews the available American Urology Association practice guidelines many practitioners follow, which focus on the male population. Sexual dysfunction guidelines for the female population are much more limited, and future work should review the existing literature and gaps to provide a more robust understanding of sexual dysfunction in PD. PD represents a particularly vulnerable population for development of sexual dysfunction given the multifactorial nature of its manifestations. Given its profound impact on not only the patient, but their partner, it is important to be aware of the various manifestations of SD when evaluating individuals with PD. Through thorough history taking and targeted psychosexual evaluation, we as practitioners can ensure a more holistic and comprehensive approach to caring for individuals with PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,"Nov 28, 2025",2025,Nov,28,Rafetto A N|Murray G R|Ziegelmann M J,Rafetto A N|Murray G R|Ziegelmann M J,"Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Rafetto A N, Murray G R, Ziegelmann M J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41313338/,"Parkinson's disease can cause sexual dysfunction in men, including issues with sexual desire, arousal, and physical intimacy.

41313337,Admission Acid-Base Status and Mortality in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Patients.,"BackgroundThere is limited evidence on the epidemiology and prognostic significance of acid-base disorders in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU). This study examines the association of acid-base status at admission with in-hospital mortality among CICU patients.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of adults admitted to the Mayo Clinic CICU from 2007-2018 with available blood gas data, utilizing values obtained closest to CICU admission. Arterial pH, serum bicarbonate, base excess, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were examined as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations, with adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, illness severity, and interventions.ResultsAmong 3229 patients included for analysis, acidemia (pH < 7.35) emerged as the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.98, P < .003). Metabolic acidosis (HCO3 < 20 mEq/L, aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.24-1.95, P < .001) and respiratory acidosis (PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg, aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14-1.81, P = .002) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality, whereas metabolic and respiratory alkalosis were not. After adjustment, lower pH and more negative base excess were associated with higher in-hospital mortality (both P < .001), whereas HCO3 and PaCO2 were not (P = .053 and P = .051, respectively). Patients with combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis had the highest in-hospital mortality (56.3%).ConclusionsShort-term survival in CICU patients decreases progressively with worse acidemia, especially in the context of combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis.

41311233,Principles of oncology.,"Cancer is a significant global health concern and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Recent projections estimate about 2 million new diagnoses of cancer each year in the United States, with about 20 million new global cases. Despite the rising incidence of new cancer diagnoses, cancer-specific mortality is decreasing due to significant progress in prevention, treatment, and supportive care. This has led to increased attention in the field of cancer survivorship, which aims at improving quality of life and long-term symptom management in cancer survivors. Cognitive dysfunction is among the most prominent symptoms managed by patients with central nervous system and systemic cancer. While there has been significant progress in understanding cancer related cognitive dysfunction and related challenges faced by cancer survivors, future research is needed to identify risk factors and therapeutic options for these important symptoms. In this review, we provide an overview of cancer epidemiology, risk factors, and biology. We next discuss mechanisms and common side effects of cancer therapeutic modalities including surgery, radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy. We end with a discussion of malignant and benign central nervous system tumors providing background into tumor types and treatment considerations.

41218282,Flagellar swimming at low Reynolds numbers: zoospore-inspired robotic swimmers with dual flagella for high-speed locomotion.,"Traditional locomotion strategies fail in low-Reynolds-number fluid environments, where viscous forces dominate over inertial forces. Microorganisms have developed specialized structures such as cilia and flagella to overcome this challenge, enabling efficient movement through highly resistive environments. Among these organisms,Phytophthorazoospores demonstrate unique locomotion mechanisms that allow them to rapidly spread and attack new hosts while expending minimal energy. In this study, we present the design, fabrication, and testing of a zoospore-inspired robot, which leverages dual flexible planar flagella and oscillatory propulsion mechanisms to emulate the natural swimming behavior of zoospores. Our experiments and theoretical model reveal that both flagellar shape and oscillation frequency strongly influence the robot's propulsion speed, with longer flagella and higher frequencies yielding enhanced performance. Additionally, the anterior flagellum, which generates a pulling force on the body, is dominant in enhancing propulsion efficiency compared to the posterior flagellum's pushing force. This is a significant experimental finding, as it would be challenging to observe directly in biological zoospores, which spontaneously release the posterior flagellum when the anterior flagellum detaches. This work contributes to the development of advanced microscale robotic systems with potential applications in medical, environmental, and industrial fields. It also provides a valuable platform for studying biological zoospores and their unique locomotion strategies.Creative Commons Attribution license.",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,"Nov 28, 2025",2025,Nov,28,Chikere N C|Lozano Voticky S|Tran Q D|Ozkan-Aydin Y,Tran Q D,"Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, United States of America.|Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.","Chikere N C, Lozano Voticky S, Tran Q D, Ozkan-Aydin Y",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41218282/,"The study presents a zoospore-inspired robot with dual flexible flagella that can swim efficiently at low Reynolds numbers, mimicking the rapid and energy-efficient locomotion of Phytophthora zoospores.
