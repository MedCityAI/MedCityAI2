40737539,Real-world outcomes of infections following tisagenlecleucel in patients with B-cell ALL: a CIBMTR analysis.,"Tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) is a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL). We report infectious complications for 100 days (D100) following tisa-cel therapy in 471 pediatric and young adults (median age 13.8 years) with R/R B-ALL reported from September 2017 to June 2022. By D100, 137 (29%) patients had an infectious event, with an infection density of 0.542 per 100 person-days at risk. D100 cumulative incidences of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were 14.1%, 11.6%, and 1.3%, corresponding to infection density scores of 0.296, 0.213, and 0.033 per 100 person-days at risk, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, receipt of ≥3 lines of therapy before tisa-cel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.08; P = .015), any-grade cytokine release syndrome (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.17-2.71; P = .007), and lack of neutrophil recovery (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.47-4.69; P = .001) were associated with an increased risk for any infection. Similar associations were observed for bacterial infections, with the addition of younger age as an adverse risk (<6 vs 6-15 years; HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.23-4.61; P = .01). Risk factors for viral infections included increasing age (1-year increase; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .016), prior history of any infection (HR, 2.76, 95% CI, 1.40-5.46; P = .004), and prior hematopoietic cell transplant (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.18-3.71; P = .011). D100 infection-related mortality (IRM) rate was low at 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.8). In this multicenter real-world study, we observed a high incidence of infectious complications but a low IRM following tisa-cel for R/R B-ALL.© 2025 American Society of Hematology.

40435511,Infection after CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma: real-world analysis from CIBMTR.,"Infection is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) receiving CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The current study analyzed the natural history, risk factors, and outcomes of infection in 3350 patients with R/R LBCL receiving commercial CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (n = 2804 axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi-cel], n = 546 tisagenlecleucel) from December 2017 to June 2022. Infection developed in 834 patients (24.9%) within 100 days after infusion, resulting in an infection density of 0.43 per 100 patient days and a 100-day cumulative incidence of 22%. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were recorded in 527 (15.7%), 374 (11.2%), and 108 patients (3.2%), respectively, with corresponding infection densities of 0.23, 0.15, and 0.04 per 100 patient days. After a 24-month median follow-up, 1482 patients (44%) had died, with infection as the primary cause in 173 cases (12%). The 100-day infection-related mortality (IRM) was 1.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.0). Patients with a Karnofsky performance score of ≤80, infection history before CAR T-cell therapy, axi-cel therapy, severe cytokine release syndrome (grade ≥3), and severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (grade ≥3) had increased infection risk. Infections within 100 days were an independent risk factor for inferior overall survival beyond day 100 after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. In conclusion, study results show a significant incidence of infection and IRM in patients with R/R LBCL treated with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Furthermore, results identify patients at a heightened risk of infection, offering insights to guide potential interventions aimed at mitigating infection and improving patient outcomes after CAR T-cell therapy.Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), permitting only noncommercial, nonderivative use with attribution.",Blood advances,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Wudhikarn K|Herr M M|Chen M|Martens M J|Baird J H|Gowda L|Rangarajan H G|Abid M B|Kharfan-Dabaja M A|Williams K M|Ganguly S|Young J H|Sharma A|Fatobene G|Jain T|Kanakry C G|Modi D|Grover N S|Salem B|Batista M V|Vergidis P|Yin D E|Beitinjaneh A M|Kelkar A H|Nishihori T|Holter Chakrabarty J|Gergis U|Smith M|El Boghdadly Z|Dandoy C E|Murthy H S|Huppler A R|Perales M|Chemaly R F|Hill J A|Riches M|Auletta J J,Kharfan-Dabaja M A|Vergidis P|Murthy H S,"Center of Excellence in Translational Hematology and Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.|Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.|CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Biostatistics, Data Science Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Lymphoma, Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.|Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale Cancer Center and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.|Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH.|Divisions of Hematology/Oncology and Infectious Diseases, Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.|Division of Hematology-Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.|Houston Methodist Hospital and Neal Cancer Center, Houston, TX.|Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.|Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.|LIM31, Disciplina de Hematologia, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.|Division of Hematological Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.|Center for Immuno-Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.|Division of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI.|Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.|Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.|Department of Infectious Disease, A.C.

40561511,Efficacy and safety of thrombolysis for pediatric venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We conducted this systematic review to evaluate outcomes of thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone in pediatric patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This systematic review addresses mortality, VTE resolution, recurrence, bleeding, and organ-specific outcomes in 5 PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) questions on thrombolysis across pulmonary embolism (PE), extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), right atrial thrombosis (RAT), cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT), and renal vein thrombosis (RVT). Meta-analysis reported risk ratios or differences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]), and absolute effects per 1000 patients. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of recommendation, assessment, Development, and Evaluation) guidelines. Thirteen nonrandomized studies were included and no randomized clinical trials addressed these questions. Thrombolysis might be associated with a higher risk of major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, or unspecified bleeding with risk differences of 0.09 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.23), 0.06 (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.22), and 0.09 (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.23), respectively. In PE with hemodynamic compromise, thrombolysis might be associated with a lower risk of mortality but conclusions on PE progression were uncertain in submassive PE. In DVT, thrombolysis may have little to no effect on mortality or thrombus resolution but might be associated with lower risk of postthrombotic syndrome. In RAT, thrombolysis might have little to no effect on thrombus resolution but a higher risk of major bleeding and mortality. For CSVT and RVT, the evidence was very limited. These findings were based on very-low-certainty evidence because of confounding and imprecision from small sample sizes.

40674706,"High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified: an LLMPP study.","Molecular characterization of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBCL-NOS), is hindered by its rarity, evolving definition, and poor diagnostic reproducibility. To address this challenge, we analyzed 92 HGBCL-NOS tumors collected across Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project sites. Leveraging comparison cohorts of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS (DLBCL-NOS) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and molecular frameworks described in these entities, our analysis revealed a heterogenous molecular landscape, reminiscent of DLBCL-NOS but with an enrichment of BL features. By cell-of-origin classification, 59% were germinal center B-cell-like (GCB), and 25% were activated B-cell-like (ABC). LymphGen, a genetic classifier for DLBCL-NOS, assigned a genetic subtype to 34% of HGBCL-NOS. Although classification rate was lower than in DLBCL-NOS (66%), assigned subtypes spanned the spectrum of LymphGen classes, including 31% of ABCs classified as MCD. Features differentiating HGBCL-NOS from DLBCL-NOS included MYC rearrangement (47% vs 6%); dark zone signature (DZsig) expression (45% vs 7%); and more frequent mutation of ID3, MYC, CCND3, and TP53, all common to BL. A genetic classifier that differentiates DLBCL-NOS from BL classified 53% of DZsig+ tumors as BL-like, and those classified as DLBCL-like were frequently BCL2-rearranged. Among DZsig- GCB tumors, 95% were DLBCL-like. Centralized pathology review reclassified almost half of tumors as DLBCL-NOS but did not identify a more homogenous HGBCL-NOS population, with no difference in features between confirmed and reclassified tumors. In conclusion, molecular testing enables a subset of HGBCL-NOS to be assigned to established categories. Based on rarity and diagnostic challenges, broader inclusion of HGBCL-NOS should be considered in biomarker-driven DLBCL trials.Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), permitting only noncommercial, nonderivative use with attribution.",Blood advances,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Collinge B|Hilton L K|Wong J|Alduaij W|Ben-Neriah S|Slack G W|Farinha P|Boyle M|Meissner B|Cook J R|Ott G|Rosenwald A|Campo E|Amador C|Greiner T C|Raess P W|Song J Y|Inghirami G|Ondrejka S L|Jaffe E S|Weisenburger D D|Chan W C|Holte H|Beiske K|Fu K|Delabie J|Pittaluga S|Iqbal J|Wright G|Savage K J|Mungall A J|Staudt L M|Steidl C|Feldman A L|Morin R D|Rimsza L M|Scott D W,Feldman A L,"Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.|Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.|Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus and Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.|Institute of Pathology, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.|Hematopathology Section, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigaciones Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.|Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.|Department of Pathology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.|Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.|Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital and K.G.

40472282,Individual response to lifestyle interventions: a pooled analysis of three long-term weight loss trials.,"We explored the manifestations of individual weight loss (WL) response to long-term lifestyle interventions on cardiometabolic risk.We pooled data from three large long-term lifestyle WL-intervention trials: 24-month DIRECT (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00160108; n = 322; 87% adherence), 18-month CENTRAL (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01530724; n = 278; 86% adherence), and 18-month DIRECT PLUS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03020186; n = 294; 89% adherence). We analyzed longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic risk markers, including anthropometrics, blood biomarkers, and magnetic-resonance-imaging-assessed fat depots, and measured DNA-methylation, proteomics, and metabolomics. Among trial completers (n = 761, mean age = 50.4 years; 89% men, baseline body-mass-index = 30.1 kg/m2), mean WL was -3.3 kg (-3.5%). We classified participants as Successful-WL (36%) with relative-WL > 5%, WL-Resistant (28%) who did not lose or gained weight, and Moderate-WL (36%) with WL between 0% and 5%. Successful-WL achieved the greatest improvements in multiple health indicators. However, the WL-Resistant also showed some significant improvements, with increased high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) and decreased leptin and visceral fat (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Overall, each 1 kg sustained lifestyle-induced WL was associated with improvements in lipid markers and insulin resistance [HDLc (+1.44%), triglycerides (-1.37%), insulin (-2.46%), HOMA-IR (-2.71%), leptin (-2.79%)] and intrahepatic-fat regression (-0.49 absolute-units)] and modest but significant change in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (-0.26% and -0.36%). We identified 12 significant methylation sites that are associated with Successful-WL (FDR < 0.05; AUC = 0.73).While only ∼one-third of individuals achieved long-term WL, the Moderate-WL and WL-Resistant individuals could benefit improvements in visceral adiposity and cardiometabolic risk by shifting towards a healthy lifestyle pattern, beyond WL. Site-specific DNA methylation may predict an individual's likelihood of successful WL.NCT00160108, NCT01530724, NCT03020186.© The Author(s) 2025.

41056528,Factors Associated With More Medication Trials Before Surgical Evaluation and Postsurgical Outcomes in Pediatric Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.,"Despite strong evidence supporting timely surgical evaluation, many children with drug-resistant epilepsy undergo multiple antiseizure medication (ASM) trials before surgery. Because guidelines recommend evaluation after failure of 2 appropriate ASMs, evaluation after failure of >2 ASMs serves as a clinically relevant benchmark. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with initiation of surgical evaluation after failure of >2 ASMs and evaluate its association with seizure freedom.We performed a retrospective analysis using the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium Surgery Database, including 24 US pediatric epilepsy centers. Children aged 18 years and younger who initiated epilepsy surgery evaluation between January 2018 and February 2023 were included. Timing of evaluation was defined by the number of ASM failures before first phase I evaluation (≤2 vs >2). Unadjusted analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of later evaluation and assess its association with seizure freedom, adjusting for etiology, seizure type, MRI findings, and surgical procedure.Among 1,767 patients, 802 (45.4%) initiated surgical evaluation after failing ≤2 ASMs and 965 (54.6%) after failing >2 ASMs, with a median age at seizure onset of 5.96 and 4.00 years, respectively. Factors independently associated with later initiation of surgical evaluation included genetic etiology (odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.60), generalized seizures (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.58-4.40), daily seizures (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-2.14), multiple seizure types (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.39-1.82), normal MRI (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.52-2.18), and abnormal neurologic examination (OR 2.44, 95% CI 2.01-2.96). Surgical intervention rates were similar (∼50%) between groups. Patients who initiated surgical evaluation after failure of ≤2 ASMs had significantly higher seizure freedom rates (60.8% vs 39.3%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, failure of >2 ASMs before surgical evaluation was independently associated with lower odds of seizure freedom (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96, p = 0.028).Initiation of surgical evaluation after failure of more than 2 ASMs is associated with more complex epilepsy phenotypes and lower rates of seizure freedom. However, 80% of these patients still experienced a >50% reduction in seizures, highlighting the therapeutic benefits of timely epilepsy surgery-even when seizure freedom is unlikely-regardless of epilepsy subtype.",Neurology,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Samanta D|Newell G|Caraway A R|Brock E|Albert G W|Novotny E J|Depositario Cabacar D F|Oluigbo C O|Gaillard W D|Tatachar P|Bolton J B|Wong-Kisiel L|Romanowski E F|Mcnamara N A|Eschbach K|Alexander A L|Auguste K I|Gonzalez-Giraldo E|Bernardo D|Ostendorf A P|Coryell J|Karia S|Karakas C|Javarayee P K|Pichon P D|Olaya J|Shrey D W|Reddy S B|Ganesh A|Hauptman J S|Singh R K|Ciliberto M|Marashly A|Grinspan Z M|Nangia S|Arredondo K|Miller D J|Sattar S|Montenegro M|Agarwal N|Galan F N|Wagner J|Abel T J|Knox A T|Perry M S,Wong-Kisiel L,"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.|University of Colorado, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora.|Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX.|Seattle Children's Hospital, WA.|Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC.|Ann & Robert H.

41066723,Core Clinical Features Associated With Survival in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies.,"This analysis used clinical data from prospectively followed participants meeting criteria for probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) between 1998 and 2024. DLB is characterized by unique core features of visual hallucinations (VHs), parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive fluctuations with a variable disease course. DLB is associated with a poor prognosis, but whether these unique DLB core clinical features influence survival is unknown. We aimed to determine whether core clinical features are associated with survival in patients with probable DLB.Patients followed in the Mayo Clinic ADRC between 1998 and 2024 underwent annual clinical assessments. Those who met clinical criteria for probable DLB were analyzed. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models using age as the time scale determined associations between the individual and cumulative number of core clinical DLB features and survival. The prognostic significance of core features present at the time DLB criteria were met was assessed in separate models. Models were adjusted for sex and duration from the onset of cognitive symptoms to DLB diagnosis.Of 488 patients with probable DLB meeting inclusion criteria, 118 (24%) were women with a mean age of 71.9 ± 8.4 years at the time of meeting probable DLB criteria. Shorter survival was associated with the development of VHs (hazard ratio [HR] 3.25, 95% CI 2.46-4.29) and parkinsonism (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.54-3.39) during the disease course and VHs at the time of DLB diagnosis (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.18-2.16). All four core features were also associated with shorter survival (4 core features vs 2 core features, HR 3.58 95% CI 2.66-4.80, 4 core features vs 3 core features, HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.86-3.25). In 191 patients (45 women (24%) with a mean age of 71.2 ± 8.6 years at probable DLB diagnosis) with autopsy-confirmed DLB, VHs, parkinsonism, and all four core features were associated with shorter survival. Sex was not associated with survival.VHs, parkinsonism, and the development of all 4 core features were associated with shorter survival in probable and in autopsy-confirmed DLB. These findings have important prognostic and management implications for patients with DLB and their caregivers.",Neurology,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,McCarter S J|Ferman T J|Grant K M|Aakre J|Knopman D S|Graff-Radford N R|Forsberg L K|Fields J A|Day G S|Miyagawa T|Savica R|Botha H|Jones D T|Ramanan V K|Lachner C|Nguyen A T|Murray M E|Petersen R C|Reichard R R|Dickson D W|Kantarci K|Boeve B F|Graff-Radford J,McCarter S J|Ferman T J|Grant K M|Aakre J|Knopman D S|Graff-Radford N R|Forsberg L K|Fields J A|Day G S|Miyagawa T|Savica R|Botha H|Jones D T|Ramanan V K|Lachner C|Nguyen A T|Murray M E|Petersen R C|Reichard R R|Dickson D W|Kantarci K|Boeve B F|Graff-Radford J,"Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Center for Sleep Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.|Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL; and.|Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.","McCarter S J, Ferman T J, Grant K M, Aakre J, Knopman D S, Graff-Radford N R, Forsberg L K, Fields J A, Day G S, Miyagawa T, Savica R, Botha H, Jones D T, Ramanan V K, Lachner C, Graff-Radford J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41066723/,"The key finding of this study is that the development of visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and the presence of all four core clinical features (visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive fluctuations) are associated with shorter survival in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.

41071969,What Are the Proposed Mechanisms Contributing to the Manifestations of Anti-NMDAR Encephalitis?,"Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the first well-characterized autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies directed against neuronal surface proteins in the CNS.1-3 Initially described in patients with ovarian teratoma,2 this disorder typically presents with the rapid onset of a characteristic constellation of clinical features, including severe memory impairment, prominent psychiatric and behavioral disturbances, insomnia, seizures, facial dyskinesia and other abnormal movements, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction.1-4 These clinical features are consistent with the diverse roles of NMDAR signaling within the CNS, involving both glutamatergic neurons and local GABAergic interneurons across circuits that control cognition, behavior, and survival.5,6 Several experimental models have investigated the mechanisms by which NMDAR autoantibodies result in synaptic dysfunction and contribute to the clinical manifestations of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.7-10 These studies demonstrate that the autoantibodies crosslink NMDARs, disrupting their surface trafficking and promoting receptor internalization. This leads to a reduction in synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR density and NMDAR-mediated currents, disrupting the excitatory-inhibitory synaptic balance and inducing changes in hippocampal and cortical γ oscillations.7,11,12.",Neurology,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Vilaseca A|Dalmau J O|Benarroch E,Vilaseca A|Benarroch E,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.|Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain.|Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red, Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain; and.|Department of Neurology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.","Vilaseca A, Dalmau J O, Benarroch E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41071969/,"Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies that target NMDAR, a key receptor in the brain.

41092248,Cerebral Blood Flow in Children and Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia.,"Understanding age-related changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF, rate of blood delivery to brain tissue) in sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a prerequisite to incorporating CBF as a marker of brain health. CBF decreases from school-age through adulthood in nonanemic people. In SCA, CBF is generally increased to compensate for anemia, but knowledge of age-related norms is limited. We hypothesized that age-related CBF trajectories differ for SCA vs nonanemic healthy persons: CBF increases from childhood to early adulthood in SCA to compensate for reduced blood oxygen content and then plateaus because of reduced vasodilatory capacity with older age.Children and adults with SCA and race-matched controls (hemoglobin [Hb] AA) aged 6-45 years were enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study from 2014 to 2023 at an academic and community health center. History of overt stroke or arterial stenosis >50% were exclusions. Brain MRIs were performed at 3T with arterial-spin-labeling measurements of gray matter CBF. Regression analyses assessed how age, imaging markers of ischemia, Hb, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) related to CBF.In 192 Black participants with SCA (N = 126; mean age = 18.7 ± 9.0 years, 52.4% female) or without SCA (N = 66; mean age = 22.4 ± 9.7 years, 54.5% female), total Hb was lower in SCA (mean Hb = 8.9 ± 1.3 g/dL) vs control (mean Hb = 13.4 ± 1.5 g/dL) participants (p < 0.001) and did not differ with age in the SCA group. SpO2 was reduced in SCA (median SpO2 = 96%; interquartile range [IQR] = 94-97.4%) vs controls (median SpO2 = 98%, IQR = 97-99%, p < 0.001). In SCA participants, SpO2 was lower in adults (median SpO2 = 95%, IQR = 94%-97%, p = 0.001) compared with children (SpO2 = 96.5%, IQR = 95%-98.2%). Regression analyses, including an interaction between age and group (SCA vs control), showed that CBF increases in SCA by 5.03 mL/100 g/min per decade (95% CI 1.70-8.37) and plateaus at approximately age 30-35 years. In controls, CBF decreased by -5.20 mL/100 g/min per decade (95% CI -8.96 to -1.94).The divergent age dependency of CBF between SCA and non-anemic persons may be explained by a gradient of increasing CBF with age required to compensate for reductions in blood oxygen content in SCA, with possible exhaustion of cerebral vasodilatory abilities in the fourth decade of life.

41183210,The RANK/RANKL axis controls vascular dynamics in the bone marrow.,"Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is an essential cytokine that induces osteoclastic differentiation by monocyte-macrophage lineage precursors. Here, we showed that in addition to its conventional action, RANKL controls vascular permeability in the bone marrow, where it facilitates the mobilization of hematopoietic monocytic cells, including osteoclast precursors, and resultantly regulates bone metabolism. RANK, a cognate receptor for RANKL, is abundantly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and controls vascular permeability by regulating the expression patterns of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. High RANKL expression was detected in perivascular C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12-abundant reticular (CAR) stromal cells. Specific deletion of RANKL expression in CAR cells abrogated the vascular leakage, suggesting that perivascular RANKL is responsible for controlling permeability. In summary, our study revealed a role for RANK/RANKL signaling as a gatekeeper of bone marrow sinusoids in vivo.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Nov 11, 2025",2025,Nov,11,Kaneko T|Yari S|Kikuta J|Omatsu Y|Seno S|Kikuchi S|Sato K|Fujii K|Sudo T|Hasegawa T|Furuta K|Guo Q|Ibrahim S H|Muraoka K|Okada Y|Kubota Y|Okuzaki D|Kobayashi Y|Kumanogoh A|Udagawa N|Nagasawa T|Penninger J M|Ishii M,Furuta K|Guo Q|Ibrahim S H,"Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Respiratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|World Premier International Research Center Initiative Immunology Frontier Research Center, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka 567-0085, Japan.|Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Bioinformatic Engineering, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.|Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Anatomy, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.|Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.|Department of Biochemistry, Matsumoto Dental University, Nagano 399-0704, Japan.|Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Lower Saxony 38124, Germany.|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna 1090, Austria.|Department of Medical Genetics, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.|Life-omics Research Division, Institute for Open and Transdisciplinary Research Initiative, The University of Osaka, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.","Kaneko T, Yari S, Kikuta J, Omatsu Y, Seno S, Kikuchi S, Sato K, Fujii K, Sudo T, Hasegawa T, Furuta K, Guo Q, Ibrahim S H, Muraoka K, Okada Y, Ishii M, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183210/,"The study found that the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway, which is known to regulate bone formation, also controls the permeability of blood vessels in the bone marrow.

41212537,Delirium Optimization with Volunteer Engagement (DOVE): A Retrospective Study.,"To assess the efficacy of a local volunteer program, delirium optimization with volunteer engagement (DOVE), in preventing in-hospital delirium.Between February 2023 and June 2024, volunteers provided structured interventions to patients at risk for delirium, as identified by the Delirium Risk Assessment (DRA) score. Interventions are humanities-based and included sensory aide assistance, completion of ""get to know me"" forms, and conversation. Data were retrospectively acquired from electronic health records and compared to a control cohort, from another medical unit. Delirium occurrence was captured when nursing confusion assessment method (CAM) documentation was positive, or clinician documented delirium diagnoses. Cohorts were matched 1:2 (DOVE vs Control) by age, gender, DRA score, month/year of admission, and length of hospital stay.A total of 168 patients received interventions by DOVE volunteers, of which 139 of those were matched with 261 controls. In-hospital delirium occurrence was lower in the DOVE cohort compared to the control cohort (46.8% vs 56.7%; P = 0.015). Conditional logistic regressions demonstrated a lower Odds Ratio for delirium occurrence 0.55 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]; 0.34-0.89; P = 0.015) associated with DOVE intervention. Subgroup analyses of delirium occurrence among patients with DRA score of 3-4 demonstrated an OR of 0.56 (95% CI; 0.31-1.01; P = 0.053) between the DOVE and control cohorts.In-hospital delirium occurrence was ∼10% lower among DOVE cohort patients. This humanities-based intervention offers a feasible strategy, particularly during times of staffing shortages, and should be considered for broader implementation across healthcare institutions.© The Author(s) 2025.

41026521,Extracellular matrix alterations in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy revealed by quantitative proteomics.,"Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is a leading cause of heart failure characterized by extensive remodeling of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). While initially adaptive, ECM deposition following ischemic injury eventually turns maladaptive, promoting adverse cardiac remodeling. The strong link between the extent of fibrosis and adverse clinical outcomes has led to growing interest in ECM-targeted therapies to prevent or reverse maladaptive cardiac remodeling in ICM; yet, the precise composition of the ECM in ICM remains poorly defined. In this study, we employed sequential protein extraction enabled by the photocleavable surfactant Azo to enrich ECM proteins from left ventricular tissues of patients with end-stage ICM and nonfailing donor hearts. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics identified and quantified over 6,000 unique protein groups, including 315 ECM proteins. We discovered significant upregulation of key ECM components, particularly glycoproteins, proteoglycans, collagens, and ECM regulators. Notably, LOXL1, FBLN1, and VCAN were among the most differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analyses revealed enhanced TGFB signaling, integrin-mediated adhesion, and complement activation in ICM tissues, suggesting a feedback loop driving continued ECM deposition in the end-stage failing heart. Together, our findings provide a comprehensive proteomic landscape of ECM alterations in the end-stage ICM myocardium and identify promising molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.",JCI insight,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Buck K M|Rogers H T|Gregorich Z R|Mann M W|Aballo T J|Gao Z|Chapman E A|Perciaccante A J|Price S J|Lei I|Tang P C|Ge Y,Tang P C,"Department of Chemistry.|Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology.|Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences.|Department of Medicine, and.|Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.|Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering and.|Department of Cardiac Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Human Proteomics Program, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.","Buck K M, Rogers H T, Gregorich Z R, Mann M W, Aballo T J, Gao Z, Chapman E A, Perciaccante A J, Price S J, Lei I, Tang P C, Ge Y",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41026521/,"The study found significant changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hearts of patients with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), a leading cause of heart failure.

41026957,Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Then Blinatumomab for Older Adults With Newly Diagnosed B-Cell ALL: Alliance Study A041703 Cohort 1 Results.,"Older patients with ALL receiving conventional chemotherapy have poor survival due to toxic death and relapse. We hypothesized that a chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen using the anti-CD22 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by the bispecific anti-CD19/CD3 T-cell engager blinatumomab would reduce toxic death and yield high rates of prolonged remission and survival.Eligible patients were age 60 years and older with untreated, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative, CD22-positive, B-cell ALL. Patients received up to two cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by four or five cycles of blinatumomab with intrathecal methotrexate CNS prophylaxis. The primary end point was 1-year event-free survival (EFS).The 33 eligible patients had a median age of 71 years (range, 60-84) and a median CD22 expression of 92% (range, 21%-100%). Eight (24%) had previous chemotherapy or radiation for other cancers, six for multiple myeloma. The composite complete remission rate was 85% after two cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin and 97% by the end of two cycles of blinatumomab.

41211656,Comparison of Bare Metal vs Covered Proximal Stent Fixation During Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair of Complex Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.,"Fenestrated stent-grafts with proximal bare-metal fixation stent (BMFS) may provide better rotational movement to facilitate vessel catheterization, but novel designs with covered fixation stents (CFSs) have been increasingly utilized with lower profile fabric. This study aimed to evaluate procedural metrics and outcomes of fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) using BMFS and CFS devices.Clinical data of 502 consecutive patients enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized investigational device exemption (IDE) study were reviewed. Patients with 4-vessel fenestrated stent-grafts with BMFS or CFS for treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs) and Extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) were included. Patients with Extent I-III TAAAs and stent-grafts designed with <4 fenestrations or scallops were excluded. Endpoints were technical success, radiation exposure, major adverse events (MAEs), patient survival, freedom from secondary interventions, and target artery instability (TAI).There were 147 patients (29%; 85% male, median 75 years old) treated by FEVAR using 4-vessel fenestrated stent-grafts with BMFS in 79 patients or CFS in 68 patients. Patients treated with BMFS designs had significantly (p<0.05) higher prevalence of cigarette smoking and peripheral artery disease and less often had Extent IV TAAAs. Use of BMFS designs decreased from 88% (64/73) to 20% (15/74) after 2018 (p<0.001). Technical success was similar in patients treated with or without BMFS designs (99% vs 100%, p=0.47), but total operating time and cumulative air karma were significantly lower (p<0.05) in patients with CFS designs. Overall 30-day mortality was 1%, with no difference in mortality and MAEs among patients treated with or without BMFS (1% vs 1%, p=1.0 and 15% vs 12%, p=0.59), respectively. Patient survival at 1 and 3 years was 95%±2%, and 85%±4% for all patients with no difference between groups (p=0.51). Freedom from secondary interventions was 88%±3.6% for patients with BMFS and 86%±4.6% for those with CFS at 1 year (p=0.71), with also no difference at 3 years (p=0.55).FEVAR for CAAAs and Extent IV TAAAs was performed with high technical success, low mortality, and MAEs, independent of the use of BMFS. There is no difference in patient survival and freedom from secondary interventions in patients treated with or without BMFS.Clinical ImpactOne hundred forty-seven patients were treated with bare-metal fixation-stent (79) or covered fixation stents (68). Technical success was similar (p=.47). Overall 30-day mortality was 1%, with no difference in major adverse events (MAEs; p=.59). At 1- and 3-year, there was no difference in patient survival (p=.51), freedom from secondary intervention (p=.71). In conclusion, FEVAR for CAAAs and Extent IV TAAAs was performed with high technical success, low mortality and MAEs, independent of the use of bare-metal fixation stent.",J Endovasc Ther,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Lima G B|Huang Y|Ruiter Kanamori L|Tenorio E R|Schmid B P|Maximus S|Saqib N|Macedo T A|Mendes B C|Oderich G S,Lima G B|Mendes B C,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.|McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.","Lima G B, Huang Y, Ruiter Kanamori L, Tenorio E R, Schmid B P, Maximus S, Saqib N, Macedo T A, Mendes B C, Oderich G S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41211656/,"The study compared the use of bare-metal and covered proximal stent fixation during fenestrated endovascular aortic repair for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.

However, evidence for its efficacy in arm liposculpture remains inconclusive.To compare the effects of cold (4°C) and warm (37°C) tumescent solutions on postoperative outcomes in arm liposculpture, focusing on pain, bruising, and fat emulsification quality.This double-blinded, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients undergoing bilateral arm liposculpture. One arm was infiltrated with a cold tumescent solution and the other with a warm solution, randomly assigned. Liposuction was performed using VASER-assisted fat emulsification followed by Power-Assisted Liposuction (PAL) or conventional suction-assisted liposuction (SAL). Outcomes included pain (Visual Analog Scale) assessed at Days 1, 8, 15, and 30; bruising, and lipocrit values.A total of 104 arms were analyzed from 52 female participants (mean age: 39.7 years; mean BMI: 24.7 kg/m²). Pain scores were similar between groups at all time points (Day 1: Cold = 5 [2-9], Warm = 6 [2-9]; p = 0.9). Bruising areas were comparable (Cold: 40,444 mm²; Warm: 41,212 mm²; p > 0.05). Lipocrit values for Microaire and SAL techniques showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Patients reported high satisfaction, with 78.7% ""very satisfied"" and 96.1% recommending the procedure.Cold tumescent solutions do not significantly enhance outcomes in arm liposculpture compared to warm solutions. Surgeons should exercise caution with cold solutions due to potential hypothermia risks.

41212526,Redefining Rurality: Adopting an Identity-Based and Community-Engaged Approach to Defining Rural Cancer Disparities.,"Rural health disparities in the United States remain poorly understood, in part due to inconsistent definitions of ""rurality"" and the failure to integrate both geographic and socially constructed dimensions of place. This commentary draws from insights shared during the panel ""Addressing Diversity in Cancer Prevention, Control, and Survivorship Within Rural Communities"" at the 2024 Transforming Community and Rural Healthcare (TCRH) conference. Panelists emphasized the limitations of current rural-urban classification systems, which often overlook the intersectional identities, cultural heterogeneity, and lived experiences of rural populations. They advocated for integrating community-based participatory research (CBPR) and identity-based approaches to define rurality more holistically. Such methods prioritize self-identification, social determinants of health (SDOH), and localized knowledge, allowing for a more accurate assessment of cancer disparities and the development of equitable interventions. The commentary outlines how geophysical and census-based metrics, while convenient, can misrepresent rural communities and inadvertently perpetuate disparities in cancer care access, outcomes, and policy. The authors argue for an identity- and community-centered conceptualization of rurality that is dynamic, inclusive, and responsive to the complexity of rural life.© The Author(s) 2025.

41213103,A phase II trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of a folate receptor alpha vaccine in patients with triple negative breast cancer.,"CD4 T cell immunity is associated with improved survival in patients with breast cancer. We previously reported a Phase I trial evaluating a folate receptor alpha (FRα) vaccine administered with cyclophosphamide (CP), demonstrating excellent safety and immunogenicity. To simplify the vaccine strategy for ease of use, we report here the results of a randomized Phase II trial evaluating a lower vaccine dose alongside the original dose, administered with or without cyclophosphamide pretreatment.Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who completed all systemic and local therapy were assigned to receive either Low-dose (825 mg) or High-dose (2.5 mg) vaccine peptides plus GM-CSF in six 4-week cycles, with or without CP prior to vaccination. Safety was monitored and immunogenicity was evaluated pre- and post-vaccination.A total of 80 patients were dosed with vaccine, and 58 patients were evaluable for immunogenicity. Vaccination was well tolerated and elicited immunity in 83% of patients. Levels of FRα-specific T cells were high, persistent, and comparable to T cell levels against tetanus toxoid. No differences in immunity were observed between the two doses. CP pretreatment also did not affect the immune responses. Recurrences occurred in 8 evaluable patients and were unrelated to the treatment arm. No patients died during the study due to their disease.The reduced dose FRα vaccine is as effective as the original dose and does not require CP to generate maximal immunity.

41212544,Evaluation of Interventions for Cognitive Symptoms in Long COVID: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Treatment for cognitive dysfunction due to postacute sequelae of long COVID (ie, symptoms of fatigue, malaise, weakness, confusion that persist beyond 12 weeks after an initial COVID infection) remains a significant unmet need.To test evidence-based rehabilitation strategies for improving cognitive symptoms in persons with long COVID.This was a 5-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 3 remotely delivered interventions conducted between August 17, 2023, and June 10, 2024. The study took place at 22 trial sites and included the screening of individuals with cognitive long COVID.Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 arms: adaptive computerized cognitive training (BrainHQ [Posit Science]), cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation involving both group and individual counseling sessions (PASC-Cognitive Recovery [PASC-CoRE]) paired with BrainHQ, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with BrainHQ. Two comparator arms were included as follows: unstructured computer puzzles and games (active comparator) and sham tDCS paired with BrainHQ. The interventions occurred 5 times per week over 10 weeks.Cognitive and behavioral in-person assessments were performed at baseline, midintervention, at the end of intervention, and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the modified Everyday Cognition Scale 2 (ECog2) completed at the end of the intervention compared to the baseline visit based on participant self-report looking back over the prior 7 days.A total of 378 individuals were screened, from which there were 328 participants (median [IQR] age, 48.0 [37.0-58.0] years; 241 female [73.5%]; race: 15 Asian [4.6%], 47 Black [14.3%], and 235 White [71.6%]; ethnicity: 52 Hispanic [15.9%]). None of the 3 active interventions demonstrated benefits on the modified ECog2 in the intention-to-treat population by the end of the intervention period. The adjusted differences in mean change were 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for tDCS-active + BrainHQ vs tDCS-sham + BrainHQ, and 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs BrainHQ alone. Secondary participant-reported outcomes and neuropsychological tests showed no differential benefits for any treatment arm. All 5 arms demonstrated some improvements over time on the modified ECog2 and on secondary outcomes. There were no serious adverse events attributable to the interventions.This phase 2 randomized clinical trial failed to demonstrate differential benefits for online cognitive training, a structured cognitive rehabilitation program, and tDCS for cognitive long COVID.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05965739.",JAMA neurology,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Knopman D S|Koltai D|Laskowitz D|Becker J|Charvet L|Wisnivesky J|Federman A|Silverstein A|Lokhnygina Y|Pilloni G|Haddad M|Mahncke H|Van Vleet T|Huang R|Cox W|Terry D|Karwowski J|McCray N|Lin J J|McComsey G A|Singh U|Geng L N|Chu H Y|Reece R|Moy J|Arvanitakis Z|Parthasarathy S|Patterson T F|Gupta A|Ostrosky-Zeichner L|Parsonnet J|Kiriakopoulos E T|Fong T G|Mullington J|Jolley S|Shah N S|Morimoto S S|Lee-Iannotti J K|Killgore W D S|Dwyer B|Stringer W|Isache C|Frontera J A|Krishnan J A|O'Steen A|James M|Harper B L|Zimmerman K O,Knopman D S,"Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.|Division of General Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.|Department of Neurology, Grossman School of Medicine, New York University, New York.|Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.|Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.|Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.|Posit Science, San Francisco, California.|RECOVER Patient, Caregiver, or Community Representative, Durham, North Carolina.|Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.|Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.|Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City.|Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.|Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.|Department of Medicine, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown.|Department of Internal Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.|Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson.|Department of Medicine/Infectious Diseases, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio.|Departments of Internal Medicine and Neurology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City.|Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston.|Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.|Department of Neurology, Dartmouth Health, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.|Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.|Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora.|Division of Infectious Diseases, Endeavor Health, Evanston, Illinois.|Population Health Sciences, Division of Health Systems Innovation and Research, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.|Department of Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Phoenix.|Department of Psychiatry, University of Arizona, Tucson.|Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine at Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.|Department of Medicine, Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California.|Department of Medicine, University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville.|Department of Medicine, Illinois Research Network and University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago.|Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.","Knopman D S, Koltai D, Laskowitz D, Becker J, Charvet L, Wisnivesky J, Federman A, Silverstein A, Lokhnygina Y, Pilloni G, Haddad M, Mahncke H, Van Vleet T, Huang R, Cox W, Zimmerman K O, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41212544/,"This clinical trial tested three different interventions - cognitive training, cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation, and transcranial direct current stimulation - to improve cognitive symptoms in people with long COVID.

41212742,Prerepair Mortality in Cleft Lip and/or Palate: A Retrospective Analysis of Early Childhood Deaths.,"ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify specific causes, clinical features, and contributing factors associated with early childhood mortality in a vulnerable subset of patients with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) who did not survive to undergo surgical repair.DesignThis was a retrospective chart review study.SettingThe study was conducted at a single tertiary medical center.Patients/ParticipantsWe identified 26 liveborn CL/P patients who died without cleft repair from 1970 to 2024. Their data was compared to a control group of 2070 surgically repaired CL/P patients from the same institution.Main Outcome MeasuresOur primary goal was to characterize the clinical profile of patients experiencing prerepair mortality. Secondary outcomes included identifying causes of death, maternal and prenatal risk factors, and comparing these findings with the surgically repaired patients.ResultsAll 26 unrepaired patients (100%) had genetic syndromes or isolated severe congenital anomalies, a significant difference compared to 24% in the surgically repaired group (P < .0001). Trisomy 13 (30.8%), holoprosencephaly (23.1%), congenital cardiac defects (11.5%), and trisomy 18 (11.5%) were the leading causes of death. The median age at death for unrepaired patients was 25 days (interquartile range 4-125 days), significantly lower than the 61.9 years in the control group (P < .0001). Multivariable logistic regression showed that genetic syndromes or severe congenital anomalies were strongly associated with early mortality (P < .0001). Notably, all unrepaired patients who were born in the United States after 2005 had accurate prenatal diagnoses, which allowed clinical planning before the patients were born.ConclusionsPrerepair mortality in CL/P is significantly driven by underlying genetic syndromes or congenital anomalies. For surgeons, this highlights the importance of genetic testing and prenatal care to guide appropriate surgical management. Considering a wait in surgical intervention until patients are approximately 4 months old may allow for better survival assessment and informed decisions for these high-risk individuals.",Cleft Palate Craniofac J,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Wan R|Adam E A|Jabs E W|Pichurin P N|Mardini S|Gibreel W,Wan R|Adam E A|Jabs E W|Pichurin P N|Mardini S|Gibreel W,"Division of Plastic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Clinical Genomics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.","Wan R, Adam E A, Jabs E W, Pichurin P N, Mardini S, Gibreel W",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41212742/,"This study found that children with cleft lip and/or palate who did not undergo surgical repair often had underlying genetic syndromes or severe congenital anomalies, which were the main causes of their early deaths.

41212811,Succinylcholine-induced rhabdomyolysis in a patient with RYR1 and BCHE variants: A case report.,"Masseter muscle spasm after succinylcholine can herald malignant hyperthermia (MH) in genetically susceptible individuals. We aimed to describe the perioperative course and genetic findings in a patient who developed transient masseter spasm and postoperative rhabdomyolysis after general anesthesia. This single-patient case report draws on perioperative observations, laboratory testing, and whole-genome sequencing. Immediately after induction with propofol and succinylcholine, the patient experienced transient masseter spasm; anesthesia was then maintained with total intravenous anesthesia (propofol and remifentanil). Postoperatively, laboratory studies showed severe rhabdomyolysis with mild pigment nephropathy; the patient received intravenous hydration, laboratory values normalized by postoperative day 4, and discharge occurred in good condition. Whole-genome sequencing identified heterozygous ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) c.1840C>T (p.Arg614Cys)-a known MH-susceptibility variant in the skeletal-muscle ryanodine receptor-and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) c.293A>G (p.Asp98Gly), which reduces butyrylcholinesterase activity and delays succinylcholine hydrolysis. The coexistence of these variants likely synergistically increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ release and prolonged succinylcholine effect, precipitating rhabdomyolysis; to our knowledge, this appears to be the first reported case linking concurrent RYR1 and BCHE variants to rhabdomyolysis following general anesthesia.",Biomolecules & biomedicine,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Harrison T E|Weingarten T N|Sprung J,Harrison T E|Weingarten T N|Sprung J,"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Harrison T E, Weingarten T N, Sprung J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41212811/,"The key finding of this medical research is that a patient developed transient masseter spasm and severe rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) after receiving the anesthetic drug succinylcholine, due to the presence of genetic variants in the RYR1 and BCHE genes.

41212997,"Coramitug, a Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for the Treatment of Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy: a Phase 2, Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a progressive disease caused by the deposition of transthyretin as amyloid in the myocardium. Current therapies may slow disease progression but do not clear existing deposits. Coramitug is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets misfolded transthyretin, designed to promote clearance of transthyretin amyloid through antibody-mediated phagocytosis.This phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized participants with ATTR-CM to receive infusions every 4 weeks of either coramitug at two dosages (10 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg) or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio for 52 weeks. The primary endpoints were the change from baseline to week 52 in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. Safety was assessed for up to 64 weeks by assessing treatment-emergent adverse events, all-cause mortality, and number of cardiovascular (CV) events comprising hospitalization due to CV events or urgent heart failure visits.In total, 104 participants (median age 77 years; 93% men; 84% New York Heart Association class II; 13% with variant ATTR-CM) were randomized and dosed: 34 to coramitug 10 mg/kg, 35 to coramitug 60 mg/kg, 35 to placebo. Median NT-proBNP was 1985 pg/mL (interquartile range: 1224, 3406 pg/mL). In total, 90% of participants were on disease-modifying therapy; 84% were treated with tafamidis and 7 (6.7%) with TTR silencers (patisiran, n=4; vutrisiran, n=3).

41213043,Detecting Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis With Artificial Intelligence: A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial.,"Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is underdiagnosed despite expanding treatment options.To develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented clinical program for ATTR-CM detection.This nonrandomized clinical trial involved constructing an AI model, ATTRACTnet, using electrocardiogram waveforms, echocardiographic measurements, demographics, and diagnosis codes for orthopedic manifestations of amyloidosis. A single-system, multisite, single-arm, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate its real-world performance. The model was trained and validated at a large academic referral site for ATTR-CM with external validation at an academic site. The trial was conducted as a single-system, multisite trial. Patients with left ventricular (LV) wall thickness 12 mm or more and an ATTRACTnet score 0.5 or higher were eligible. Exclusions included prior ATTR-CM testing, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, expected life span less than 1 year, nursing home residence, advanced dementia, or LV wall thickness less than 14 mm explained by uncontrolled hypertension or moderate/severe aortic stenosis.Eligible patients were notified and offered nuclear scintigraphy testing, monoclonal protein testing, and follow-up care on agreement from the treating physician.The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ATTR-CM by consensus criteria. ATTR-CM testing positivity was compared with historical and contemporary controls.ATTRACTnet was developed in an internal test set of 799 patients (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [11.1] years; 516 [64.7%] male and 283 [35.3%] female) using 5-fold cross-validation with an additional external test set of 422 patients. It had good discrimination for ATTR-CM detection with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.85 (5-fold cross-validation, 0.77-0.85) in the internal set and 0.82 (95% CI, .81-0.83) in the external test set with similar performance in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White patients. A total of 1471 patients were identified with positive AI model scores 0.5 or more during the study period, with 256 eligible patients who met study criteria. Of these patients, 50 underwent amyloidosis testing after physician and patient approval; 24 (48%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM, and 21 (88%) initiated treatment within 3 months. The positivity rate was more than 2.8 times higher than historical controls (15.3%; 95% CI, 13.1%-17.9%; P < .001), with an 18% relative increase in new diagnoses vs the prior year.AI-augmented screening may improve ATTR-CM detection and identify patients who are missed by usual care.

41213154,Loss of lung mesenchymal identities in culture and a screening approach to identify restorative cues.,"Lung fibroblasts generate and respond to mechanical, biochemical, and matrix cues present in their microenvironment. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, multiple studies describe transcriptionally unique fibroblast subpopulations in the human lung. However, limited published data suggest a loss of fibroblast native phenotypes and functions after culture ex vivo. In this study, we characterized changes in transcriptional programs of human lung mesenchyme isolated from freshly procured tissue and maintained in traditional cell culture conditions. Our results demonstrate that fibroblasts isolated and cultured in this manner adopt transcriptional programs largely distinct from those observed in vivo. To recapitulate distinct native fibroblast states in vitro, we sought to develop a screening approach to identify cues promoting native fibroblast identities. From published single-cell data, we identified unique transcriptional markers of alveolar and adventitial fibroblast subpopulations and validated the sensitivity of ELISAs for detecting changes in secreted markers of these fibroblast subpopulations. We then stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts with soluble cues known to act on fibroblasts, quantifying changes in secreted and transcriptional markers by ELISA and qPCR. While our small pilot screen did not identify single cues capable of fully recapitulating fibroblast in vivo states, it established a system that can be expanded to broadly screen additional cues and pointed toward factors likely to be critical in developing better culture models for studying human lung fibroblast function and plasticity.",American journal of physiology.

41213815,Deep-Learning Accelerated Vessel Wall Imaging Using T1-SPACE at Ultra-High Field Strength MRI.,"To evaluate the feasibility and technical performance of a post-contrast T1-SPACE sequence using deep-learning based image reconstruction (DLBIR) for intracranial vessel wall imaging (IC-VWI) at 7T, comparing image quality, artifacts, and acquisition time with the standard-of-care (SOC) T1-SPACE sequence.In this retrospective single-center study, 36 patients (21 women; mean age, 53.3 ± 16.2 years) underwent IC-VWI at 7T using both SOC T1-SPACE and DLBIR-accelerated T1-SPACE sequences. Two independent neuroradiologists assessed overall image quality (noise, artifacts, sharpness, and overall quality), wall and lumen visualization along the intracranial vessels using a 4-point Likert scale. A cumulative-logit mixed-effects model (CLMM) of segment ratings was used for intersequence comparison. Segments were also pooled into proximal vs distal vessels and quality compared using exact paired sign test. Overall image quality metrics were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests and Bland-Altman plots. Inter-reader agreement was summarized using percent agreement.On segment-level analysis, T1-SPACEDL yielded markedly higher ratings than T1-SPACESOC [wall: OR = 22.79 (95% CI 15.83- 32.82), lumen: OR = 97.0 (95% CI 66.8-141.0); both FDR-adjusted p<0.001]. Effects remained large when segments were pooled into proximal and distal segments [For wall, proximal segment OR = 297.0 (95% CI 40-∞) and distal segment OR = 71.0 (28-404); for lumen, proximal OR = 82.0 (36-339) and distal OR = 225.0 (60-13350); all FDR-adjusted p<0.001]. Reader-wise Wilcoxon tests showed higher overall image quality scores across noise, artifacts, sharpness, and overall quality for T1-SPACEDL ([all p < 0.001]). Inter-reader agreement was uniformly high with T1-SPACEDL when compared to T1-SPACESOC. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a positive bias favoring T1-SPACEDL. Acquisition time was reduced from 7:30 minutes with T1-SPACESOC to 6:00 minutes (20% reduction) with T1-SPACEDL.Contrast-enhanced T1-SPACEDL at 7T may have potential clinical utility for IC-VWI, given the shorter acquisition, significantly improved image quality and reduced image artifacts.DLBIR＝deep learning-based image reconstruction; SNR＝signal-to-noise ratio; CNR＝contrast-to-noise ratio; VWI＝Vessel Wall Imaging; DL＝ deep-learning; SOC＝ standard-of-care.© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",AJNR.

41214336,"20 years of taxane therapy in prostate cancer - the past, present and future.","2024 marked the twentieth anniversary of FDA approval for taxane therapy, namely docetaxel, in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Approval of this treatment modality signified a breakthrough in the field, as it demonstrated for the first time that a non-antiandrogen targeting agent could significantly improve survival of patients with prostate cancer. New evidence has further solidified the role of taxanes, demonstrating that it improves survival when used in combination with androgen-targeting therapy in early-stage metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Consequently, taxane therapy is currently considered a gold standard and mainstay in the treatment of prostate cancer. In this Review, we present an up-to-date analysis of the pivotal role of taxanes in the treatment of prostate cancer, discuss reasons why taxanes are effective and discuss how the mechanisms that confer resistance to taxanes in prostate cancer might be exploited to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.© 2025.

40239134,Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Digital Pathology Biomarker to Predict Benefit of Long-Term Hormonal Therapy and Radiotherapy in Men With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Across Multiple Phase III Trials.,"Long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) receiving radiotherapy (RT). Predictive biomarkers are needed to guide ADT duration.A multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI)-derived predictive biomarker was trained for long-term (LT) versus short-term (ST) ADT using pretreatment digital prostate biopsy images and clinical data (age, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason, and T stage) from six NRG Oncology phase III randomized radiotherapy trials. The novel MMAI-derived biomarker was developed to predict the differential benefit of LT-ADT on the primary end point, distant metastasis (DM). MMAI predictive utility was validated on a seventh randomized trial, RTOG 9202 (N = 1,192), which randomly assigned men to RT + ST-ADT (4 months) versus RT + LT-ADT (28 months). Fine-Gray and cumulative incidence analyses for DM, and secondarily, death with DM, were performed. Deaths without DM were treated as competing risks.In the validation cohort (median follow-up, 17.2 years), LT-ADT significantly improved DM from 26% to 17% (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.82], P < .001). A significant biomarker-treatment predictive interaction was observed (P = .04) for DM, whereby MMAI biomarker-positive men (n = 785, 66%) had reduced DM with LT-ADT versus ST-ADT (sHR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.73], P < .001), whereas no treatment benefit was observed for MMAI biomarker-negative men (n = 407; sHR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.84], P = .84). The estimated 15-year DM risk difference between RT + LT-ADT and RT + ST-ADT was 14% in MMAI biomarker-positive men and 0% in MMAI biomarker-negative men. The MMAI biomarker was also prognostic for DM, irrespective of treatment (sHR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.72 to 3.19], P < .001).To our knowledge, the MMAI model is the first validated predictive biomarker to guide ADT duration with RT in localized/locally advanced PCa. Approximately one third of men with high-risk PCa could safely be spared the additional 24 months of ADT and the associated morbidity.",J Clin Oncol,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Armstrong A J|Liu V Y T|Selvaraju R R|Chen E|Simko J P|DeVries S|Sartor O|Sandler H M|Mohamad O|Huang H|Griffin J|Yamashita R|Esteva A|Tran P T|Spratt D E|Carson J H|Peters C|Gore E|Lee S P|Monson J M|Augspurger M E|El-Gayed A|Rodgers J P|McKay R|Morgan T|Feng F Y|Nguyen P L,Sartor O,"Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.|Artera Inc, Los Altos, CA.|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.|University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD.|Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.|Saint John Regional Hospital, Saint John, New Brunswick, CA.|Northeast Radiation Oncology Center, Dunmore, PA accrual for Regional Hospital of Scranton.|Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI.|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, Accrual for Clarkson Hospital.|Long Beach VA Healthcare System, Long Beach, CA.|Saint Agnes Medical Center, Fresno, CA.|Baptist Medical Center South, Jacksonville, FL.|Saskatoon Cancer Centre, Saskatoon, SK.|NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center, Philadelphia, PA.|American College of Radiology, Philadelphia, PA.|University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.","Armstrong A J, Liu V Y T, Selvaraju R R, Chen E, Simko J P, DeVries S, Sartor O, Sandler H M, Mohamad O, Huang H, Griffin J, Yamashita R, Esteva A, Tran P T, Spratt D E, Nguyen P L, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40239134/,"This study developed an artificial intelligence-based biomarker that can predict which men with high-risk prostate cancer will benefit from longer-term hormonal therapy and radiation therapy.
