41026957,Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Then Blinatumomab for Older Adults With Newly Diagnosed B-Cell ALL: Alliance Study A041703 Cohort 1 Results.,"Older patients with ALL receiving conventional chemotherapy have poor survival due to toxic death and relapse. We hypothesized that a chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen using the anti-CD22 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by the bispecific anti-CD19/CD3 T-cell engager blinatumomab would reduce toxic death and yield high rates of prolonged remission and survival.Eligible patients were age 60 years and older with untreated, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative, CD22-positive, B-cell ALL. Patients received up to two cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by four or five cycles of blinatumomab with intrathecal methotrexate CNS prophylaxis. The primary end point was 1-year event-free survival (EFS).The 33 eligible patients had a median age of 71 years (range, 60-84) and a median CD22 expression of 92% (range, 21%-100%). Eight (24%) had previous chemotherapy or radiation for other cancers, six for multiple myeloma. The composite complete remission rate was 85% after two cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin and 97% by the end of two cycles of blinatumomab. At a median follow-up of 30 months, the 1-year EFS and overall survival were 75% (95% CI, 61 to 92) and 85% (95% CI, 73 to 98), respectively. EFS was shorter with lower CD22 expression or detectable measurable residual disease at any time point.Inotuzumab ozogamicin then blinatumomab without maintenance chemotherapy in older patients with untreated, Ph-negative, CD22-positive, B-cell ALL yields a high remission rate and excellent EFS. Given the lack of standard, safe, and effective therapies in this population, the regimen should be considered a standard treatment option.",J Clin Oncol,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Wieduwilt M J|Yin J|Kour O|Teske R|Stock W|Escherich C|Yang J|Li Z|Byrd K|Doucette K|Mangan J|Hall S|Mims A S|Jamieson K|Dinner S N|Bseiso A W|Giordano G|Saygin C|Uy G L|Litzow M R|Stone R M,Yin J|Kour O|Teske R|Litzow M R,"Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC.|Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center, Rochester, MN.|University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.|St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.|Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Westwood, KS.|Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC.|University of California San Diego Medical Center, La Jolla, CA.|Helen F.

40239134,Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Digital Pathology Biomarker to Predict Benefit of Long-Term Hormonal Therapy and Radiotherapy in Men With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Across Multiple Phase III Trials.,"Long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) receiving radiotherapy (RT). Predictive biomarkers are needed to guide ADT duration.A multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI)-derived predictive biomarker was trained for long-term (LT) versus short-term (ST) ADT using pretreatment digital prostate biopsy images and clinical data (age, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason, and T stage) from six NRG Oncology phase III randomized radiotherapy trials. The novel MMAI-derived biomarker was developed to predict the differential benefit of LT-ADT on the primary end point, distant metastasis (DM). MMAI predictive utility was validated on a seventh randomized trial, RTOG 9202 (N = 1,192), which randomly assigned men to RT + ST-ADT (4 months) versus RT + LT-ADT (28 months). Fine-Gray and cumulative incidence analyses for DM, and secondarily, death with DM, were performed. Deaths without DM were treated as competing risks.In the validation cohort (median follow-up, 17.2 years), LT-ADT significantly improved DM from 26% to 17% (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.82], P < .001). A significant biomarker-treatment predictive interaction was observed (P = .04) for DM, whereby MMAI biomarker-positive men (n = 785, 66%) had reduced DM with LT-ADT versus ST-ADT (sHR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.73], P < .001), whereas no treatment benefit was observed for MMAI biomarker-negative men (n = 407; sHR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.84], P = .84). The estimated 15-year DM risk difference between RT + LT-ADT and RT + ST-ADT was 14% in MMAI biomarker-positive men and 0% in MMAI biomarker-negative men. The MMAI biomarker was also prognostic for DM, irrespective of treatment (sHR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.72 to 3.19], P < .001).To our knowledge, the MMAI model is the first validated predictive biomarker to guide ADT duration with RT in localized/locally advanced PCa. Approximately one third of men with high-risk PCa could safely be spared the additional 24 months of ADT and the associated morbidity.",J Clin Oncol,"Nov 10, 2025",2025,Nov,10,Armstrong A J|Liu V Y T|Selvaraju R R|Chen E|Simko J P|DeVries S|Sartor O|Sandler H M|Mohamad O|Huang H|Griffin J|Yamashita R|Esteva A|Tran P T|Spratt D E|Carson J H|Peters C|Gore E|Lee S P|Monson J M|Augspurger M E|El-Gayed A|Rodgers J P|McKay R|Morgan T|Feng F Y|Nguyen P L,Sartor O,"Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.|Artera Inc, Los Altos, CA.|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.|University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD.|Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.|Saint John Regional Hospital, Saint John, New Brunswick, CA.|Northeast Radiation Oncology Center, Dunmore, PA accrual for Regional Hospital of Scranton.|Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI.|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, Accrual for Clarkson Hospital.|Long Beach VA Healthcare System, Long Beach, CA.|Saint Agnes Medical Center, Fresno, CA.|Baptist Medical Center South, Jacksonville, FL.|Saskatoon Cancer Centre, Saskatoon, SK.|NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center, Philadelphia, PA.|American College of Radiology, Philadelphia, PA.|University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA.|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.","Armstrong A J, Liu V Y T, Selvaraju R R, Chen E, Simko J P, DeVries S, Sartor O, Sandler H M, Mohamad O, Huang H, Griffin J, Yamashita R, Esteva A, Tran P T, Spratt D E, Nguyen P L, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40239134/,"The study developed an artificial intelligence-based biomarker that can predict which men with high-risk prostate cancer will benefit from long-term hormonal therapy and radiotherapy.

41207798,The validation of histological criteria from the IAIH-PG to distinguish AIH from drug-induced liver injury.,"To validate the applicability of the new histological criteria for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) proposed by the International AIH Pathology Group (IAIH-PG) among Chinese patients with AIH and drug-induced liver injury (DILI).The gold standard for diagnosis relied on clinical response: discontinuing treatment without relapse supported DILI, while relapse or ongoing immunosuppressive treatment confirmed AIH. This two-centre retrospective cohort study included inpatients with DILI or AIH from January 2002 to March 2023. Cases that underwent liver biopsy were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The diagnostic performance of the criteria was assessed by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).Out of 69 patients: AIH (41, 59%) and DILI (28, 41%). The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the new histological criteria for likely and possible AIH were 70%, 98% and 29%, respectively, with an AUROC of 0.8236 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7533-0.8938]. For likely AIH, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 73%, 61% and 89%, respectively, with an AUROC of 0.9177 [95% CI: 0.8757-0.9596]. Moreover, for possible AIH, significant differences were found in serum alanine aminotransferase levels [178.4 (87.0, 435.0) versus 536.5 (206.9, 930.4) U/L] and antinuclear antibody (ANA) ≥1:160 [10 (67%) versus 1 (6%)], as well as in lobular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate [15 (100%) versus 12 (71%)] and more than mild inflammation [13 (87%)versus 6 (35%)] between AIH and DILI (all P values were <0.05).The new histological criteria exhibit good diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing AIH from DILI in China, with high AUROC. Key discriminators include low aminotransferase, ANA ≥1:160, lobular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and more than mild inflammation, which may further improve diagnostic accuracy for AIH.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Histopathology,"Nov 09, 2025",2025,Nov,09,Ma Z|Wang L|Liu J|Saxena R|Chen Z|Zhang X|Wang H|Vij M|Komuta M|Soon G|Zheng W|Zhang J|Wang B|Li M|Yang Y|Zhao X,Chen Z,"Liver Research Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.|Department of Infectious Disease and Liver Disease, The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.|Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.|Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.|The Institute of Liver Disease & Transplantation, Dr. Rela Institute & Medical Center, Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, India.|Department of Pathology, International University of Health and Welfare, School of Medicine, Narita Hospital, Chiba, Japan.|Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore City, Singapore.|Department of Pathology, Guangzhou Huayin Medical Laboratory Center, Guangzhou, China.|Department of Pathology, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Diagnostic Pathology Center, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.|Department of Clinical Epidemiology and EBM, National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.","Ma Z, Wang L, Liu J, Saxena R, Chen Z, Zhang X, Wang H, Vij M, Komuta M, Soon G, Zheng W, Zhang J, Wang B, Li M, Yang Y, Zhao X",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41207798/,"This study validated the use of new histological criteria proposed by the International AIH Pathology Group to distinguish autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) from drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in Chinese patients.

41206949,Different diabetes types and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a Mendelian randomization and pathway/gene-set analysis.,"The associations between different types of diabetes, characterized by distinct pathophysiology and genetic architecture, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk are not understood.We investigated associations of genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D), eight T2D mechanistic clusters, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) with PDAC risk. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level statistics for T2D (242,283 cases, 1,569,734 controls), T1D (18,942 cases, 501,638 controls), and PDAC (10,244 cases and 360,535 controls) in individuals of European ancestry.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using the Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR-RAPS) method indicated that genetically predicted T2D was associated with PDAC risk (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.05-1.15), particularly the T2D obesity (OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.42) and lipodystrophy (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.03-1.51) clusters. No association was observed for T1D with PDAC risk (OR = 1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.02). Pathway/gene-set analysis using the summary-based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) method revealed a significant association between the MODY gene-sets and PDAC risk (P = 1.5 × 10-8), which remained after excluding 20 known PDAC GWAS loci (P = 7.6 × 10-4). HNF1A, FOXA3, and HNF4A were the top contributing genes after excluding the previously identified GWAS loci regions.Our results from this genetic association study support that T2D, particularly the obesity and lipodystrophy mechanistic clusters, and MODY genomic susceptibility regions play a role in the etiology of PDAC.Published by Oxford University Press 2025.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,"Nov 09, 2025",2025,Nov,09,Zhang T|Hua X|Mohindroo C|Wang X|Dutta D|Liu J|Katta S|Li S A|Wang J|Antwi S O|Arslan A A|Beane Freeman L E|Bracci P M|Canzian F|Du M|Gallinger S|Goodman P J|Katzke V|Kooperberg C|Le Marchand L|Neale R E|Patel A V|Perdomo S|Shu X|Visvanathan K|Van Den Eeden S K|White E|Zheng W|Albanes D|Andreotti G|Bamlet W R|Brennan P|Buring J E|Chanock S J|Chen Y|Darst B|Ferrari P|Giovannucci E L|Goggins M|Haiman C|Hassan M|Holly E A|Hung R J|Jones M R|Kraft P|Kurtz R C|Malats N|Moore S C|Ng K|Oberg A L|Orlow I|Peters U|Porta M|Rabe K G|Rothman N|Sánchez M|Sesso H D|Silverman D T|Southey M C|Um C Y|Yarmolinsky J|Yu H|Yuan C|Zhong J|Wolpin B M|Risch H A|Amundadottir L T|Klein A P|Yu K|Zhang H|Stolzenberg-Solomon R Z,Antwi S O|Bamlet W R|Oberg A L|Rabe K G,"Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.|Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, Rockville, MD, USA.|National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Jacksonville, FL, USA.|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.|Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.|Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.|Genomic Epidemiology Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.|Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System and University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|SWOG Statistical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.|Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.|Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA, USA.|Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, HI, USA.|Population Health Program, QIMR Berghofer, Brisbane, Queensland.|School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland.|Department of Population Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.|Genomic Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.|Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.|Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.|Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Pleasanton, CA, USA.|Cancer Prevention Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Genomic Epidemiology Branch., International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.|Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

41206919,A Proposed Path to Explaining the Unexplained Anemia of Aging.,"Approximately 17% of people aged 65 years and older are anemic, and 10% of death certificates report anemia as a secondary cause of death in the US. Nonetheless, anemia remains unexplained in 30-50% of older adults. This unexplained anemia of aging (UAA) is a diagnosis of exclusion. The mechanism, impact, and progression of UAA remain unknown. At older ages, anemia adds to pre-existing co-morbidities with significant adverse health consequences, representing a compelling unmet clinical concern. The National Institute on Aging held a workshop in 2024 to discuss current knowledge and research opportunities. Topics included the epidemiology of anemia at older age, its clinical implications; probable mechanism(s) underlying UAA, ie; low grade inflammation's effects on erythropoiesis; the role of microbiota in iron regulation in bone marrow; the importance of ruling out a diagnosis of leukemic clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which is more prevalent in older age; the role of senescence and aging governing hematopoiesis, and effects of sex hormones on hematopoietic stem cell aging. Understanding the roles of these factors could reduce the proportion of the older anemic population whose anemia remains unexplained and offer insights into new potential diagnostic and intervention strategies. Speakers reviewed previous clinical trials in patients with UAA and CH. They discussed lessons learned, and future research priorities ., including efforts to develop new diagnostic algorithms and potential uses of machine learning.© The Author(s) 2025.
