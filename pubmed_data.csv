41372636,Translational Relevance of the Genomic Landscape of KRASG12D-Mutant Colorectal and Pancreatic Cancers.,"KRASG12D is one of the most prevalent driver mutations in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). Although this genetic alteration is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, additional genomic features may contribute to the behavior of KRAS-mutant PDACs and CRCs.Here, we aimed at defining the landscape of these additional genomic features of KRASG12D-mutant PDAC and CRC, and their impact on clinical outcomes.This retrospective analysis utilized circulating tumor DNA data from two cohorts with advanced CRC and PDAC: a national cohort from Guardant (n = 27,497) and a Mayo Clinic cohort (n = 1434). Patients were categorized into three groups: KRASG12D alone, KRASG12D with putative resistance alterations, and KRAS not detected (ND). Genomic co-occurrences were summarized. Overall survival (OS) was compared among groups using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable survival analysis.Among patients with KRASG12D mutation, additional oncogenic alterations were detected in 34.5% of CRC and 11.5% of PDAC in the national cohort; 38.9% of CRC, and 17.4% of PDAC in the Mayo cohort. Common additional oncogenic alterations included EGFR amplifications, additional KRAS point mutations, and alterations in NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA. Patients with KRASG12D and these alterations had significantly shorter median OS compared with those with KRASG12D alone and KRAS ND for CRC (p < 0.0001) and PDAC (p < 0.0001). Presence of KRASG12D and additional oncogenic alterations was the only variable significantly associated with OS outcomes in both CRC and PDAC.We described the genomic landscape of KRASG12D-mutant CRC and PDAC, demonstrating that cases often have additional oncogenic alterations linked to resistance to KRAS inhibition. These alterations are also associated with a worse prognosis. Recognizing these alterations may inform new therapeutic strategies. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in ongoing clinical trials.© 2025.

41372621,RoLaCaRT-1: pilot randomised phase II study of robotic vs laparoscopic hemicolectomy for right colon cancer.,"Previous stage I-III colon cancer trials demonstrated improved peri-operative and similar long-term oncological outcomes with minimally invasive approaches compared with open surgery. Subsequent technical developments, including intracorporeal anastomosis, complete mesocolic excision (CME), refined pathologic grading systems and robotic approaches are increasingly used despite minimal supporting evidence. This international phase II trial aims to assess patient, surgical and pathological outcomes following robotic (RRHC) with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (LRHC) for right sided colon cancer.Prospective, international multicentre pilot randomised phase II trial for patients with right colon adenocarcinoma, randomised 2:1 to robotic (RRHC) or laparoscopic (LRHC) surgery performed by accredited surgeons. Primary outcome was 90-day surgical morbidity measured using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Standardised pathology reviews, patient reported quality of life and surgeon task load index data was captured.RRHC vs. LRHC surgery allocation was 19 vs. 10, mean operative time 3.8 vs. 3.1 h with no operative mortality, all had R0 resection, CME rate 53 vs. 50% and intact mesocolon 94 v 100%. CCI was significantly lower at 30 and 90 days after RRHC (median (Q1, Q3): 0 (0, 9) vs. 21 (21, 26); median difference: 21; 95% CI 9-26; p = 0.005 at 30 days; p = 0.008 at 90 days). No significant differences in pathological nor quality of life data was observed. Surgeons task load data tended to favour robotic procedures. Median follow-up was 6 months. Limited funding led to early study closure.RRHC improved short-term surgical morbidity and surgeon physical demand and performance whilst obtaining similar quality of life and pathological specimen quality compared to LRHC for right sided colon cancer, supporting the case for larger randomised trials.ACTRN12620001378910.© 2025.

41372462,EchoGraph system for automated quality assessment of echocardiography reports.,"Generative AI needs automatic clinical text accuracy metrics, but none exist for echocardiography. To address this, we developed EchoGraph, a BERT-based model trained on 600 densely annotated echocardiography reports from the Mayo Clinic (2017), split 7:2:1 for training, validation, and testing, using a tailored schema with 48,256 entities and 29,731 relations annotated. Sixty random MIMIC-EchoNote reports were annotated (3672 entities and 2360 relations) for external validation. EchoGraph demonstrated strong performance predicting entities (micro F1 0.85) and relations (micro F1 0.70), maintaining performance on external validation (entity micro F1 0.80, relation micro F1 0.52). EchoGraph F1 score showed superior error sensitivity versus RadGraph F1, with 2.8-fold higher slope magnitude (-0.817 vs -0.291) and better variance explained (R2 = 0.803 vs 0.578). EchoGraph offers an effective solution for evaluating language model-based echocardiography applications, supporting more accurate AI-generated reports.© 2025.

41372416,Mapping the genetic landscape across 14 psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders display high levels of comorbidity and genetic overlap1,2, challenging current diagnostic boundaries. For disorders for which diagnostic separation has been most debated, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder3, genomic methods have revealed that the majority of genetic signal is shared4. While over a hundred pleiotropic loci have been identified by recent cross-disorder analyses5, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic influences remains poorly defined. Here we addressed this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Using genetic association data from common variants, we identified and characterized five underlying genomic factors that explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders (around 66% on average) and were associated with 238 pleiotropic loci. The two factors defined by (1) Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (SB factor); and (2) major depression, PTSD and anxiety (Internalizing factor) showed high levels of polygenic overlap6 and local genetic correlation and very few disorder-specific loci. The genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (for example, transcriptional regulation), while more specific pathways were shared at the level of the individual factors. The shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the Internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate targets for therapeutic development designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations.© 2025.

41372401,Uncovering the role of LINE-1 in the evolution of lung adenocarcinoma.,"Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth1,2. Here, in a landscape analysis of 1,024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUADs with a diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G>A:T driver mutations3 in KRAS and short subclonal diversification. LUAD in people who have never smoked (hereafter, never-smokers) showed early occurrence of copy-number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumours containing EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in female individuals of European-ancestry. Tumours from Asian never-smokers showed a short clonal evolution. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID24 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumours with ID2 showed short latency and high long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, hereafter L1) retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumours exhibited an aggressive phenotype with genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low neoantigen burden, metastasis propensity and poor overall survival. Reactivated L1-retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis probably contributes to the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family5. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans.© 2025.

41371987,Reduction of Erroneous ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Diagnoses: A Successful Nurse-led Quality Improvement Project.,"An ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is a life-threatening condition within the spectrum of acute coronary syndrome, with well-recognized implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Retrospective review of our institutional electronic health records identified patterns of inaccurate acute coronary syndrome diagnostic assignment, including the presence of erroneous ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses in discharge records. Such erroneous diagnoses in the durable health record may increase risk to patients through inadequate risk assessment and inappropriate follow-up care. Misapplication of a shortcut in our electronic health record system for rapidly ordering emergent cases was identified as a potential cause of the quality gap. To address this issue, a nurse-led quality improvement project was developed by using the define, measure, analyze, improve, and control framework. The project intervention decreased the percentage of patients with erroneous diagnoses from 24% to 7% and marginally improved nursing staff satisfaction. Our project successfully addressed an institutional quality concern. Our goal of reducing erroneous discharge diagnoses with minimal disruption to our existing practice was achieved, positively affecting our patients. Including both nurse leaders and frontline health care workers ensured the success of our project.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Secondary end points included response rates, overall survival (OS), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate (<10-5), and safety.Overall, 263 patients were randomly assigned (venetoclax-dexamethasone, n = 133; pomalidomide-dexamethasone, n = 130). Median PFS was 9.9 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.6) with venetoclax-dexamethasone versus 5.8 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 9.2) with pomalidomide-dexamethasone (HR, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.596 to 1.136]; P = .24). Overall response and very good partial response or better rates were 62% and 39%, respectively, with venetoclax-dexamethasone versus 35% and 14% with pomalidomide-dexamethasone. MRD negativity rate was 8% with venetoclax-dexamethasone and 0% with pomalidomide-dexamethasone. Median OS was 32.4 months (95% CI, 26.4 to 40.7) with venetoclax-dexamethasone and 26.9 months (95% CI, 20.4 to 38.9) with pomalidomide-dexamethasone (HR, 0.856 [95% CI, 0.612 to 1.197]). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event rates were 67% with venetoclax-dexamethasone versus 83% with pomalidomide-dexamethasone. There were 16 (12%) treatment-emergent deaths with venetoclax-dexamethasone versus 8 (6%) with pomalidomide-dexamethasone.The primary end point of PFS was not met. PFS and OS were numerically longer with venetoclax-dexamethasone versus pomalidomide-dexamethasone in t(11;14)-positive RRMM. Consistent with previous studies, infections were associated with venetoclax-dexamethasone; no new safety signals were observed.",J Clin Oncol,"Dec 10, 2025",2025,Dec,10,Popat R|Beksac M|Dimopoulos M A|Gatt M E|Gay F|Jo J|Kapoor P|Katodritou E|Kortüm K M|Ling S|Nagarajan C|Suzuki K|Qiu L|Onishi M|Ku G|Dail M|Mukherjee N|Ross J A|Badawi M A|Fusco M J|Dobkowska E|Arriola E|Bueno O F|Bahlis N J|Iida S|Moreau P|Valent J|Mateos M,Kapoor P,"Haematology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.|Department of Hematology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.|Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.|Department of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.|Department of Hematology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.|Division of Hematology 1, Department of Biotechnology and Health Science, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Città della Salute e della Scienza, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.|Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.|Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Hematology, Theagenion Cancer Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.|Department of Internal Medicine II, Würzburg University Hospital, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.|Department of Haematology, Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.|Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.|Myeloma/Amyloidosis Center, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.|National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders & State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.|Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA.|AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, IL.|Pharmacyclics Switzerland GmbH, An AbbVie Company, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.|AbbVie, Maidenhead, United Kingdom.|Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.|Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.|Department of Hematology, University Hospital Hôtel-Dieu, Nantes, France.|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.|Haematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Salamanca and Institute of Cancer Molecular and Cellular Biology and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.","Popat R, Beksac M, Dimopoulos M A, Gatt M E, Gay F, Jo J, Kapoor P, Katodritou E, Kortüm K M, Ling S, Nagarajan C, Suzuki K, Qiu L, Onishi M, Ku G, Mateos M, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41370738/,"The study found that the combination of venetoclax and dexamethasone did not significantly improve progression-free survival compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with the t(11;14) genetic mutation.

41369677,HER2CLIMB-05: A Phase 3 Study of Tucatinib Versus Placebo in Combination with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab as First-line Maintenance Therapy for HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"The HER2CLIMB-05 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05132582) is investigating the efficacy and safety of adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and pertuzumab as first-line (1L) maintenance therapy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC).Patients with centrally confirmed HER2+ MBC without evidence of progression post-induction therapy and no or asymptomatic brain metastases (BM) were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to tucatinib (300 mg) or placebo BID combined with trastuzumab/pertuzumab. Primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), PFS per blinded independent central review, CNS-PFS, and safety.Between March 2022 and July 2024, 654 patients were randomly assigned to tucatinib (n = 326) and placebo (n = 328) arms. All patients were female (median age: 54 years), 69.3% had de novo MBC, 52.6% were hormone receptor-positive, and 12.4% had presence/history of baseline BM. In this primary analysis, PFS was statistically significantly improved with addition of tucatinib versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.641 [95% CI: 0.514, 0.799]; P < 0.0001; median PFS: 24.9 vs 16.3 months); a PFS benefit was seen regardless of presence/absence of BM or hormone receptor status. OS data remains immature. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the tucatinib arm were diarrhea (72.7%), nausea (33.1%), and elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase: 28.2%; aspartate aminotransferase: 25.8%), of which 6.1%, 0.9%, 13.5%, and 7.1%, respectively, were grade ≥3. In the tucatinib arm, 13.5% discontinued tucatinib due to TEAEs.Tucatinib addition to trastuzumab and pertuzumab demonstrated improvement in PFS with no new safety signals identified and may be an option for 1L maintenance therapy in patients with HER2+ MBC.",J Clin Oncol,"Dec 10, 2025",2025,Dec,10,Dieras V|Curigliano G|Martin M|Lerebours F|Tsurutani J|Savard M|Jerzak K J|Hu X|Martins de Aquino Pimentel L C|O'Sullivan C C|Tokunaga E|Okines A|Huang C|Jacot W|Sohn J|Cronemberger Silva E|Mueller V|Yang S|Granata G|Shen Q|Santarpia L|Hamilton E,O'Sullivan C C,"Medical Oncology Department, Centre Eugène Marquis, Rennes, France.|European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Milano, Italy.|Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.|Medical Oncology Service, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañon, Universidad Complutense, CIBERONC, GEICAM, Madrid, Spain.|Institut Curie, Saint-Cloud, Paris, France.|The Innovative Center of Translational Research and Clinical Science for Cancer Therapy, Showa Medical University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.|Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.|Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.|Medical Oncology, Liga Norte-Rio Grandense Contra o Cancer, Brazil.|Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Breast Oncology, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.|Medical Oncology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.|Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.|Breast Care Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.|Département d'Oncologie Médicale, Institut Regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier University, INSERM U1194, Montpellier, France.|Division of Medical Oncology, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Republic of Korea.|Medical Oncology, Centro Regional Integrado de Oncologia (CRIO), Fortaleza, Brazil.|Department of Gynecology and University Breast Center, Universitaetsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.|Biostatistics, Pfizer Inc, Bothell, WA, USA.|Oncology Late Stage Development, Pfizer AG, Zug, Switzerland.|Oncology, Research and Development, Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA, USA.|Oncology, Research and Development, Pfizer AG, Zug, Switzerland.|Medical Oncology, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN, USA.","Dieras V, Curigliano G, Martin M, Lerebours F, Tsurutani J, Savard M, Jerzak K J, Hu X, Martins de Aquino Pimentel L C, O'Sullivan C C, Tokunaga E, Okines A, Huang C, Jacot W, Sohn J, Hamilton E, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41369677/,"The HER2CLIMB-05 study found that adding the drug tucatinib to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, compared to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone.

41369216,Dermoscopy Education: Association With Skin Lesion Evaluation Confidence Among Physician Associate/Assistant Students.,"Dermoscopy is a proven technique that improves diagnostic acumen in skin lesion evaluation. However, data are scarce on dermoscopy knowledge among physician associate or assistant (PA) students. The aim of this study was to ascertain US PA student's confidence in evaluating skin lesions, current dermoscopy knowledge, and current dermoscopy curriculum.An anonymous, optional survey was included in the 2024 Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) (American AAPA) student survey.A total of 613 (35.7%) PA students responded to the optional survey. Although most (78%) respondents were aware of the terms ""dermatoscope"" or ""dermoscopy,"" nearly two-thirds (65%) had not yet received dermoscopy training in their PA education and 78% indicated desire to use dermoscopy in their future practice. Respondents were slightly (27%) or somewhat confident (44%) in their ability to differentiate benign and malignant skin lesions, and those with an anticipated dermatology specialty were more confident than their peers seeking other specialties. Respondents who did not recognize the term ""dermoscopy"" (odds ratios [ORs] = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.6) and those who did not have prior dermoscopy training (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.3, 1.0) were also less likely to be confident.Physician assistant students are interested in dermoscopy training, but training is lacking in PA programs. Physician assistant programs should incorporate dermoscopy into their curriculums to ensure trained PAs have the skill to confidently evaluate skin lesions across a range of medical specialties.Copyright © 2025 PA Education Association.",J Physician Assist Educ,"Dec 10, 2025",2025,Dec,10,Middleton H T|Young P A|Kolhoff S|Warren H M|Tapia A L|O'Laughlin D J|Swanson D L|Sartori-Valinotti J C|Weatherly R M|Boswell C L,Middleton H T|Young P A|Kolhoff S|Warren H M|Tapia A L|O'Laughlin D J|Swanson D L|Sartori-Valinotti J C|Weatherly R M|Boswell C L,"Hayden T.
