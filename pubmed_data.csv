41223342,Urine Sorbitol and Xylitol for the Diagnosis of Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency-Related Neuropathy.,"Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, due to biallelic loss-of-function variants in the SORD gene, is a recently recognized cause of autosomal recessive hereditary neuropathy. Specific diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone, and molecular genetic testing of SORD is complicated by the presence of a pseudogene. Biochemical testing of serum sorbitol is suggested as a potential biomarker. We report a novel urine biochemical profile of elevated excretion of sorbitol and a second polyol, xylitol, to aid in the identification of individuals with SORD-related neuropathy.Patients with confirmed or suspected SORD-related neuropathy were recruited by clinicians from 7 academic medical centers and 1 nonprofit specialty care center. Urine was analyzed by a clinically validated, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to measure sorbitol and xylitol excretion. Over 700 reference samples were evaluated from residual clinical samples. Clinical and molecular findings were gathered using a standardized questionnaire.Nineteen individuals with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of SORD-related neuropathy (median age 31 years, 47% female) and 715 reference samples were used to determine the initial performance of this index urine test. The median sorbitol excretion in affected individuals was 638 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 456; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 198). The median xylitol excretion was 1,577 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 1,242; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 102). In this patient cohort, the combination of sorbitol and xylitol yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity for SORD-related neuropathy. Four additional individuals who had clinical phenotypes compatible with SORD-related neuropathy had abnormal urine sorbitol/xylitol profile, 2 with genotypes involving a variant of unknown significance in SORD and 2 with a single heterozygous pathogenic SORD variant detected, whereas normal urine sorbitol/xylitol levels were observed in 11 asymptomatic, heterozygous carriers.These data demonstrate the clinical utility of urine sorbitol and xylitol analysis in the screening and diagnosis of SORD deficiency-related neuropathy. In addition, this is the first description of elevated xylitol in SORD deficiency as a clinically informative biomarker, which may increase the specificity of biochemical testing.",Neurology,"Dec 09, 2025",2025,Dec,09,Bontrager J E|White A L|Brigatti K W|Laxen W|Loken P R|Grider T|Oglesbee D|Gavrilov D K|Tortorelli S|Hall P L|Matern D|Lauer E|Pickart A|Salsbery K|Niu Z|Smith C|Albright A|Mukherjee-Clavin B|Parmar P|Mhoon J|Massie R|Pilon-Cadieux C|Gauthier A|Alawneh J|Emilie Nguyen C|Shy M E|Koehler A E|Carson V J|Herrmann D N|Schultz M J,Bontrager J E|White A L|Laxen W|Loken P R|Oglesbee D|Gavrilov D K|Tortorelli S|Hall P L|Matern D|Lauer E|Pickart A|Salsbery K|Niu Z|Herrmann D N|Schultz M J,"Department of Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY.|Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Clinic for Special Children, Gordonville, PA.|Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.|Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.|Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.|Department of Neurology, Montreal Neurological Hospital, McGill University, QC, Canada.|Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada; and.|Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE.","Bontrager J E, White A L, Brigatti K W, Laxen W, Loken P R, Grider T, Oglesbee D, Gavrilov D K, Tortorelli S, Hall P L, Matern D, Lauer E, Pickart A, Salsbery K, Niu Z, Schultz M J, et al.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41223342/,"The key finding of this research is that measuring the levels of sorbitol and xylitol in urine can accurately diagnose a rare genetic condition called sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, which causes a type of nerve damage.

41225518,"Study protocol for a multicenter, multinational prospective randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes in subjects with Gram-negative bacteremia who have blood culture evaluation using Fast Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing vs. standard of care testing: the FAST trial.","Novel, rapid blood culture diagnostics can provide faster antibiotic susceptibility results (AST) compared to standard methods but their impact on clinical outcomes is unclear and not assessed in many prospective clinical trials.This study is a two-arm, multicenter, multinational, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in countries with high antibiotic resistance rates including Greece, India, Israel, and Spain. Nine hundred hospitalized subjects who have blood cultures collected as part of routine clinical care with growth of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) will be randomized 1:1 to blood culture evaluation using standard of care (SOC) AST vs. a rapid phenotypic AST method, VITEK REVEAL™ in addition to SOC AST. Subjects in both study arms will be reviewed by antibiotic stewardship clinicians who will recommend changes to antibiotic therapy, if indicated. The primary outcome is a composite three-category Desirability of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) defined using three ordered levels: alive without deleterious events, alive with at least one deleterious event, and death. Key secondary outcomes include mortality, length of stay, and time to antibiotic escalation or de-escalation within 3 days of randomization. Exploratory outcomes include a five-category DOOR, categorial agreement between VITEK REVEAL™ and SOC testing, clinician compliance with antibiotic stewardship recommendations, and desirability of treatment selection based on antibiotic spectrum, activity, and bloodstream isolate susceptibility profile (DOOR MAT). The primary analysis will be conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population.This trial will evaluate whether use of a rapid phenotypic AST method improves outcomes compared to use of conventional methods for patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections in clinical settings with high antibiotic resistance rates.ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06174649. Registered on Dec 18 2023.Number 20-0021, version 5.0, 11-April-2024.© 2025.

41221644,Exome Sequencing Enhances Screening for Familial Hypercholesterolemia Within a Multi-Site Healthcare System.,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that increases risk for premature coronary artery disease and has accessible and effective interventions. The Dutch lipid clinic network is currently the most used diagnostic criterion; however, genetic sequencing provides a definitive diagnosis of FH. The goals of this study were to determine whether germline genetic screening using exome sequencing could be used to efficiently identify individuals who were genotype positive for FH.Participants were recruited from 3 geographically and racially diverse sites in the United States (Rochester, MN; Phoenix, AZ; and Jacksonville, FL). Participants underwent Exome+ sequencing (dba Helix, San Mateo, CA) and return of results for specific genetic findings in APOB, LDLR, or PCSK9. A chart review was performed to collect demographics, personal, and family cardiovascular history.At the time of the study, 84 413 participants were enrolled in the Tapestry study. Annotation and interpretation of all variants in genes for FH resulted in the identification of 419 likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants (prevalence, 0.50%), which included 116 APOB, 298 LDLR, and 5 PCSK9. Sixty-six percent were female, the mean body mass index was 27.3, with 12.3% reporting a history of diabetes. Hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dL) was present in 39.5% and reduced HDL (<50 mg/dL) was present in 56.7% of patients. 27.5% of patients were not on cholesterol-lowering medications, and only 10% of FH carriers were at goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A history of coronary artery disease was reported in 22.4% of the cohort. Nearly 90% of these participants were newly diagnosed carriers of FH. Only 30.8% of confirmed genetic diagnoses of FH satisfied clinical (Dutch lipid clinic network) criteria for a diagnosis.Our results emphasize the need for wider utilization of germline genetic sequencing for enhanced screening and detection of individuals who have familial hypercholesterolemia.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT05212428.",Circulation.

41222035,Pursuing a headache fellowship: A narrative review.,"The intent of this review is to provide practical guidance for trainees considering a headache medicine fellowship and examine key factors that contribute to program selection. Headache medicine continues to gain appeal as a neurologic subspecialty, and the number of headache fellowship programs across the country has paralleled that growth. Residents who develop interest in the field must decide whether to pursue fellowship for more specialized training. Establishing a framework for navigating this process can help trainees better evaluate programs and make informed decisions.This narrative review was conducted as an initiative by the New Investigators and Trainees Special Interest Group of the American Headache Society in collaboration with a group of academic leaders and headache clinicians who participated in headache fellowship and/or the match process. Topics were selected based on themes identified in existing literature on fellowship selection across other disciplines. Headache-specific information was obtained from a review of literature on headache education and fellowship, along with relevant professional society and program institution websites. This information was supplemented by the authors' perspectives when available evidence was limited.Physicians choose headache medicine for various reasons. This career path derives from inspiration through mentorship received during residency, exposure to a diverse patient population during training, and the desire to provide new therapies and procedural interventions. Headache medicine fellowships offer structured and in-depth training through clinical, educational, professional, and scholarly activities. Programs may vary in size, structure, support, and patient care settings. These factors can help trainees decide whether to pursue fellowship and what to evaluate in different programs.This review identifies key factors in pursuing a headache medicine fellowship, allowing trainees to seek programs that support professional interests and career aspirations.© 2025 American Headache Society.",Headache,"Nov 12, 2025",2025,Nov,12,Fensterwald M|Pace A|Robertson C E|Robbins M S,Robertson C E,"Department of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.|Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.","Fensterwald M, Pace A, Robertson C E, Robbins M S",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41222035/,"The key finding of this medical research is that headache medicine fellowships offer specialized training through clinical, educational, professional, and scholarly activities, and trainees should consider factors such as program size, structure, support, and patient care settings when deciding whether to pursue a headache fellowship.

41222751,The comparative efficacy and safety of one-site versus two-site phacotrabeculectomy: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To compare the efficacy and safety of one-site versus two-site phacotrabeculectomy in the management of concurrent cataract and glaucoma through an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.Systematic searches were conducted across seven electronic databases through February 2025. Only randomized controlled trials comparing one-site versus two-site phacotrabeculectomy were included. Primary outcome was intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Secondary outcomes included anti-glaucoma medication (AGM) use, visual acuity, endothelial cell loss, and complications. Meta-regression analyzed the effects of mitomycin C (MMC) usage, age, and follow-up duration on outcomes.Sixteen randomized controlled trials (1087 eyes) were included. Both techniques achieved comparable IOP reduction at most timepoints. Although two-site surgery demonstrated a trend toward greater IOP reduction at select intervals (e.g., day one and 18 months), these differences were not statistically significant. AGM requirements were similar between groups at 12 months (mean difference: 0.05; 95% CI - 0.16, 0.27). Visual outcomes were comparable, though influenced by age (p = 0.004) and MMC use (p = 0.025). Endothelial cell loss was initially greater with two-site surgery but stabilized over time. Complication rates, including hyphema (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.76) and bleb-related complications (OR: 1.09; 95% CI 0.55, 2.16), were similar between groups.One-site and two-site phacotrabeculectomy demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety profiles. While two-site surgery shows a trend toward greater IOP reduction, the differences are not clinically significant. Surgical approach should be individualized based on patient characteristics, surgeon experience, and specific surgical goals rather than assumed superiority of either technique.© 2025.

41222926,International Reference Values for Surgical Outcomes of Total Pancreatectomy.,"Total pancreatectomy (TP) is indicated for advanced pancreatic cancer or multifocal tumors. Furthermore, TP may be performed to avoid the risk of pancreatic fistula in selected patients to improve the perioperative risk profile.To define reference values for TP based on a low-risk cohort treated at expert centers.This multicenter study analyzed outcomes from patients undergoing primary TP for malignant or benign lesions from 25 international expert centers from January 2017 to November 2023. Low-risk patients undergoing TP (LR-TP) were without vascular resections or significant comorbidities.TP.Twenty reference values were derived from the 75th or the 25th percentile of the median values of all centers. Outcomes of LR-TP were compared with a cohort of TP with vascular resection, TP due to high-risk pancreatic anastomosis, and the benchmark values for low-risk pancreatoduodenectomy.Of 994 patients, 333 (33.5%; median [IQR] age, 66 [58-72] years; 171 male [51.4%]) qualified as the LR-TP cohort. Reference values included blood loss (≤1000 mL), major complications (≤37%), 3-month postoperative mortality (<6%), and retrieved lymph nodes (≥29). Compared with TP with vascular resections, reference cutoffs were not met for major complications (51% vs LR-TP ≤37%) and 90-day mortality (11% vs LR-TP ≤6%). For TP due to high-risk anastomosis, failure to rescue rate (38% vs ≤6%) and 90-day mortality (11% vs LR-TP ≤6%) were not met. Compared with pancreatoduodenectomy, reference values for postoperative mortality were 3 times higher for LR-TP (≤2% vs ≤6%) and less for resected lymph nodes (≥16 vs ≥29).This case-control study provided global reference values for TP, indicating significantly higher postoperative morbidity and mortality compared with pancreatoduodenectomy. Perioperative morbidity of TP was especially increased in patients with vascular resections.

41223026,PhenoFit: a framework for determining computable phenotyping algorithm fitness for purpose and reuse.,"Computational phenotyping from electronic health records (EHRs) is essential for clinical research, decision support, and quality/population health assessment, but the proliferation of algorithms for the same conditions makes it difficult to identify which algorithm is most appropriate for reuse.To develop a framework for assessing phenotyping algorithm fitness for purpose and reuse.Phenotyping algorithms are fit for purpose when they identify the intended population with performance characteristics appropriate for the intended application.Phenotyping algorithms are fit for reuse when the algorithm is implementable and generalizable-that is, it identifies the same intended population with similar performance characteristics when applied to a new setting.The PhenoFit framework provides a structured approach to evaluate and adapt phenotyping algorithms for new contexts increasing efficiency and consistency of identifying patient populations from EHRs.© The Author(s) 2025.

41223415,Mechanobiology and Resolution of Lung Fibrosis.,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating and progressive disease marked by replacement of gas-exchanging tissue with collagen-rich scar. The mechanical environment is profoundly altered in pulmonary fibrosis and contributes to disease progression via feedback relationships between cells, the extracellular matrix, and the evolving mechanical environment. Targeting these mechanobiological feedback loops has emerged as a promising approach to interrupt disease progression, though with challenges in how to intervene selectively, safely, and effectively. We posit that further delineation of cell-matrix mechanobiological interactions will be pivotal to promoting fibrosis resolution and should guide efforts to discover and implement new approaches that can preserve or even restore lung function. To set the stage for these advances, we first review the mechanobiology of the healthy lung and the feedback loops that promote fibrosis progression. We then lay out the challenges and opportunities for targeting the fibrotic matrix as an essential element for protecting or restoring lung function.",Annual review of physiology,"Nov 12, 2025",2025,Nov,12,Link P A|Tschumperlin D J,Tschumperlin D J,"1Roy J.

41225259,Expanding the spectrum of annexin A11 proteinopathy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neuron disease.,"Aggregation of TAR-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is strongly associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), motor neuron disease (MND-TDP), and overlap disorders like FTLD-MND. Three major forms of motor neuron disease are recognized and include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Annexin A11 (ANXA11) is understood to aggregate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS-TDP) associated with pathogenic variants in ANXA11, as well as in FTLD-TDP type C. Given these observations and recent reports of ANXA11 variants in patients with semantic variant frontotemporal dementia (svFTD) and FTD-MND presentations, we sought to characterize ANXA11 proteinopathy in an autopsy cohort of 379 cases diagnosed with a primary TDP-43 proteinopathy, including FTLD-TDP, FTLD-MND, and MND-TDP. Cases with FTLD-MND and MND-TDP were classified further into PLS, ALS, and PMA based on the relative loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ANXA11 proteinopathy was present in over 40% of FTLD-MND cases. Further, ANXA11 colocalized with TDP-43 in the pathologic inclusions of all FTLD-TDP type C cases, as well as 38 out of 40 FTLD-PLS cases (95%), of which 84% had TDP type B or an unclassifiable TDP-43 proteinopathy and 16% had TDP type C. Genetic analysis excluded pathogenic ANXA11 variants in all ANXA11-positive cases. We thus demonstrated two novel ANXA11 proteinopathies strongly associated with FTLD-PLS, but not with TDP type C or pathogenic ANXA11 variants. Given the emerging relationship between TDP-43 and ANXA11 in neurodegenerative disease, we propose that TDP-43 and ANXA11 proteinopathy (TAP) comprises a distinct group of molecular pathologies and define three TAP types based on key clinical and neuropathologic characteristics.© 2025.

41225295,Socioeconomic status and concussion recovery in young athletes.,"Socioeconomic status (SES) may be associated with time to return to play (RTP) after sport-related concussion (SRC), but the literature is limited and has yielded mixed results. The purpose of our study was to determine the association between SES and concussion recovery in high school and middle school athletes.High school and middle school athletes from 24 schools in southeast Minnesota who sustained a SRC between 2020 - 2023 were included in this study. Data obtained for each concussion included date of injury and date of clearance to complete a RTP protocol. A validated measure of SES, HOUSES (HOUsing-based index of SES), was used to determine SES by pairing home addresses to publicly available property data. SES was divided into 4 quartiles determined for the region (Q1 = lowest SES quartile, Q4 = highest SES quartile). A negative-bimodal regression model was used to analyze the relationship between SES and RTP time.A total of 132 athletes (mean age 15.9 ± 1.5 years, 75.0% male) were included in the study. Among the total cohort, median RTP time was 12.0 days. Within each HOUSES quartile, median RTP time was 16 days in Q1, 12 days in Q2, 13 days in Q3, and 11 days in Q4. After adjusting for sex, race, ethnicity, and prior diagnosis of migraines, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, and mood disorder, athletes were estimated to have 23.9% fewer recovery days for each 1-unit increase in HOUSES quartile (p < 0.001).RTP time after concussion may be related to SES in young athletes, with higher SES associated with shorter RTP timelines.",The Physician and sportsmedicine,"Nov 12, 2025",2025,Nov,12,Kreitner L A|Crowley E M|Hentz R C|Wi C I|Soma D B,Kreitner L A|Crowley E M|Hentz R C|Wi C I|Soma D B,"Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Mn, USA.|Department of Orthopedics - Division of Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Mn, USA.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Rochester, Mn, USA.|Department of Community Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Mn, USA.","Kreitner L A, Crowley E M, Hentz R C, Wi C I, Soma D B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41225295/,"The study found that higher socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with shorter recovery time after a sports-related concussion in young athletes.

40393691,Effect of low-dose colchicine on pericoronary inflammation and coronary plaque composition in chronic coronary disease: a subanalysis of the LoDoCo2 trial.,"Low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events in coronary disease, but its mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. We investigated whether low-dose colchicine is associated with changes in pericoronary inflammation and plaque composition in patients with chronic coronary disease.We performed a cross-sectional, nationwide, subanalysis of the Low-Dose Colchicine 2 Trial (LoDoCo2, n=5522). CT angiography studies were performed in 151 participants randomised to colchicine or placebo after a median treatment duration of 28.2 months. Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) attenuation measurements around proximal coronary artery segments and quantitative plaque analysis for the entire coronary tree were performed using artificial intelligence-enabled plaque analysis software.Median PCAT attenuation was not significantly different between the two groups (-79.5 Hounsfield units (HU) for colchicine versus -78.7 HU for placebo, p=0.236). Participants assigned to colchicine had a higher volume (169.6 mm3 vs 113.1 mm3, p=0.041) and burden (9.6% vs 7.0%, p=0.035) of calcified plaque, and higher volume of dense calcified plaque (192.8 mm3 vs 144.3 mm3, p=0.048) compared with placebo, independent of statin therapy. Colchicine treatment was associated with a lower burden of low-attenuation plaque in participants on a low-intensity statin, but not in those on a high-intensity statin (pinteraction=0.037).Pericoronary inflammation did not differ among participants who received low-dose colchicine compared with placebo. Low-dose colchicine was associated with a higher volume of calcified plaque, particularly dense calcified plaque, which is considered a feature of plaque stability.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.
