41353287,Reproducibility of digital pathology features extracted from deep learning and foundational AI models on sequential tissue slides.,"Numerous deep learning (DL) and foundational models (FMs) designed for digital pathology analysis employ advanced feature extraction techniques from digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides obtained from tissue sections. These extracted features may serve as the input for complex models enabling automated classification tasks, slide searching, and other various medical inferences. Subtle variations in morphology observed in distinct cross sections of the same tissue sample may introduce variability that may be of little to no clinical relevance. The reproducibility of features derived from DL models and FMs on ostensibly identical tissue cross sections remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to characterize the reproducibility of features extracted from three sequential cross sections of 50 independent normal prostate samples. Slides were sectioned at approximately 50 μm intervals and we extracted cell-type specific counts, proportions, and spatial features per slide using DL models, along with feature embeddings from popular digital pathology FMs. Reproducibility of the features across sequential cross sections of tissues was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for DL model features, while extracted FM embedding distributions were evaluated via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein's distance. The median [IQR] ICC estimates for cell-type specific proportion and spatial features from the cross sections was 0.838 [0.764, 0.897], and 0.873 [0.809, 0.923] respectively. The bootstrapped mean differences of ICC estimates for the features were significantly lower (p-value < 0.05) for distant cross sections compared to the two neighboring cross sections. The feature embeddings derived from state-of-the-art digital pathology FMs showed an overall high agreement with the median [IQR] MMD of 0.06 [0.016, 0.169], and median [IQR] Wasserstein's distance of 0.021 [0.011, 0.038]. These findings demonstrate that the features derived from multiple cross sections of the same tissue exhibit overall high reproducibility, while also illustrating the expected increase in intra-sample variability as a function of physical distance between sections.© 2025.

41352976,Comparison of partial breast radiation modalities in women with early-stage breast cancer: a target trial emulation.,"Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is an effective treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, evidence comparing different PBI modalities is limited.This trial emulation uses electronic health records from a multi-state large tertiary health system. Three PBI modalities were compared proton radiation therapy, photon radiation therapy, and applicator-based brachytherapy. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to balance confounders. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR).Between 2013-2023, 1,041 women with early-stage breast cancer were treated with PBI. 1,026 patients were included in the analyses. The median age was 66 years; 22.51% had DCIS, and 97.56% were estrogen receptor positive. With median followup of 38.2 months, the rate of IBR in the overall group was 3.05% (95% CI 1.99-4.65%) at 3 years. After IPW, Compared to photon PBI, the hazard ratio (HR) for IBR for proton PBI was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-6.33), and for brachytherapy, 3.86 (95% CI 1.39-10.69). Compared to proton PBI, the HR for IBR for brachytherapy was 1.83 (95% CI 0.88-3.81). IBR risk was similar across PBI modalities for patients with tumor size ≤ 10 mm and in patients treated for DCIS. Among patients with tumor size >10 mm, the HR for IBR for brachytherapy was 7.64 (95% CI 1.64-35.58) and 3.59 (95% CI 1.22-10.56) relative to photons and protons, respectively.Partial breast irradiation with applicator-based brachytherapy was associated with higher ipsilateral breast recurrence than photon or proton PBI in patients with tumor size > 10 mm, suggesting the need for more careful PBI patient selection for this modality.© The Author(s) 2025.

41351635,Perioperative Continuous Propofol Infusion in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: A 25-Year Retrospective Study.,"In pediatric cardiac critical care, patients often require specific anesthesia and sedation considerations due to unique physiological vulnerabilities. This study assessed the incidence of propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS) in Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PCICU) patients receiving continuous propofol infusion for non-procedural sedation. We conducted a retrospective review of post-operative congenital heart disease patients < 18 years admitted to the PCICU from 1/1/2000-9/30/2024, who received continuous propofol infusions ≥ 12 hours and/or ≥ 2.4 mg/kg/hour. The primary outcome was the incidence of PRIS. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and survival to hospital discharge. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, stratified by physiological complexity (single vs. double ventricle) and surgical mortality risk scores (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery [STAT] score). A total of 641 patients were included. No statistically significant differences in propofol characteristics were found across physiologic or surgical risk groups. The median infusion rate was 1.2 mg/kg/hour, with a median duration of 22.7 hours. No cases of PRIS occurred. Survival to hospital discharge was 97%. The median ICU length of stay was 7.1 days. In this single center, retrospective study of post-operative congenital heart disease patients, continuous propofol infusion was not associated with any cases of PRIS. These findings support the cautious use of propofol in pediatric cardiac critical care. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate safety across the heterogenous congenital heart disease population, including those with single ventricle physiology.© 2025.

41351627,"Non-invasive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy: systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness, safety, and optimal stimulation parameters.","Drug-resistant epilepsy is a common and disabling condition, with few non-surgical treatment options. Non-invasive neurostimulation is an emerging therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy, though evidence is mixed and comparisons between modalities remain challenging. This review systematically appraises and compares the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), low-intensity focused ultrasound (LI-FUS), transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) in drug-resistant epilepsy. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness in seizure reduction (primary outcome), and a meta-regression analysis was conducted to investigate optimal parameters. Sixty-three studies (1342 active participants, 505 controls) were included. At the end of follow-up, pooled mean changes in seizure frequency were: rTMS - 30.2% (95% CI: [- 49.6, - 10.7%]), tDCS - 46.9% (95% CI: [- 66.6, - 27.3%]), and tVNS - 49.2% (95% CI: [- 86.7, - 11.8%]). There was insufficient data to determine effect sizes in tACS, LI-FUS and TNS. Responder rates (percentage of participants with a > 50% decrease in seizure frequency) were: rTMS 38% (95% CI: [24, 51%]), tDCS 49% (95% CI: [32, 66%]), tVNS 29% (95% CI: [7, 50%]), and TNS 42% (95% CI: [24, 60%]); with inadequate data for tACS and LI-FUS. No serious adverse events were reported, and seizure precipitation was rare. rTMS and tDCS demonstrate the strongest evidence for effectiveness, while tVNS and TNS show promise, and tACS and LI-FUS require further study. These findings, while encouraging, should be interpreted in the context of methodological heterogeneity between studies and overall low certainty of evidence.© 2025.

41351430,Learning Anatomy With Radiology: A Systematic Review.,"Radiology education is critical for medical students' anatomical competence and clinical readiness. However, it remains insufficiently integrated in medical curricula as residency program directors describe interns' basic image interpretation as unsatisfactory. This review aims to assess the efficacy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray in facilitating the learning of anatomy among medical students. Following PRISMA guidelines, 983 articles were screened, and 52 studies published between 2000 and 2025 met the inclusion criteria by comparing radiology-integrated anatomy education with traditional methods such as cadaver and atlas use. Data extraction covered study design, radiology modalities, and effect sizes. Both integrated and traditional methods consisted of medical student cohorts assessed on objective knowledge and skills with recorded quantitative outcomes. Included studies showed knowledge gains on multiple choice assessments (pooled Cohen's d = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.34-1.65) but with high heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 99.5%). Controlled designs were used in 21% of studies. Other investigations (68% of studies) used attitudinal surveys that revealed strong student preference for radiology-integrated learning. Of the modalities present, ultrasound was predominant (85% of studies), with other modalities (CT: 15%; MRI/X-ray: < 5%) substantially underrepresented despite clinical relevance. Radiology integration was shown to enhance anatomy education and clinical preparedness. The incorporation of radiology, specifically ultrasound, into anatomical education leads to a significant and substantial improvement in student learning outcomes. Future investigations can standardize assessments, expand multimodal research, and address global curricular disparities.© 2025 The Author(s).
