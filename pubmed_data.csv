41329905,Physical and Cognitive Activities and Trajectories of AD Neuroimaging Biomarkers: Longitudinal Analysis in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.,"Engagement in physical and cognitive activities is associated with a decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, but the association with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuroimaging biomarkers is less clear. We thus examined associations of physical and cognitive activities with longitudinal trajectories of AD neuroimaging biomarkers among older adults free of dementia.We conducted a longitudinal study within the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (mean follow-up durations 1.3-3.4 years). Participants were aged 50 years or older and were cognitively unimpaired or had MCI at baseline. Engagement in physical and cognitive activities during 12 months before baseline was assessed through questionnaires. Participants underwent AD neuroimaging biomarker assessments at 1 or more time points. We ran linear mixed-effect models to examine associations between physical and cognitive activity composite scores and trajectories of individual yearly change in amyloid deposition (Pittsburgh compound B [PiB]-PET centiloid), tau burden (tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]), and regional glucose hypometabolism (fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET SUVR), adjusted for age, sex, APOE ɛ4 carrier status, and medical comorbidity.We included 1,176 participants (47% female; mean [SD] age, 68.7 [9.6] years) for PiB-PET trajectories, 399 participants (49% female; mean [SD] age, 71.9 [11.0] years) for tau-PET trajectories, and 983 participants (46% female; mean [SD] age, 67.9 [9.2] years) for FDG-PET trajectories. PiB-PET and tau-PET measures increased during follow-up (3.4 [SD 4.0] and 1.3 [SD 2.1] years, respectively), whereas FDG-PET values decreased over 2.9 (SD 3.5) years of follow-up. Participants with higher total physical activity (interaction estimate 0.0017; 95% CI 0.0003-0.0031; p = 0.021) and higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (interaction estimate 0.0015; 95% CI 0.0001-0.0029; p = 0.040) had a less pronounced decrease in FDG-PET over time. Participants with higher cognitive activity experienced a less pronounced increase in PiB-PET (interaction estimate -0.2253; 95% CI -0.4437 to -0.0070; p = 0.043) and a smaller decrease in FDG-PET (interaction estimate 0.0015; 95% CI 0.0001-0.0028; p = 0.038) over time.Physical activity was associated with less synaptic dysfunction and cognitive activity with less synaptic dysfunction and lower amyloid burden over time, albeit effect sizes were small. Further research is needed to validate findings and clarify causal inference between physical and cognitive activities and AD neuroimaging biomarkers.",Neurology,"Dec 23, 2025",2025,Dec,23,Krell-Roesch J|Syrjanen J A|Hansen A L|Vemuri P|Scharf E L|Fields J A|Kremers W K|Lowe V J|Graff-Radford J|Jack C R|Petersen R C|Racette S B|Woll A|Vassilaki M|Geda Y E,Krell-Roesch J|Syrjanen J A|Vemuri P|Scharf E L|Fields J A|Kremers W K|Lowe V J|Graff-Radford J|Jack C R|Petersen R C|Vassilaki M,"Institute of Sports and Sports Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.|Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Radiology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Phoenix, AZ.|Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN.|Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.|College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix; and.|Department of Neurology and the Franke Barrow Global Neuroscience Education Center, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ.","Krell-Roesch J, Syrjanen J A, Hansen A L, Vemuri P, Scharf E L, Fields J A, Kremers W K, Lowe V J, Graff-Radford J, Jack C R, Petersen R C, Racette S B, Woll A, Vassilaki M, Geda Y E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41329905/,"The study found that higher levels of physical activity were associated with less decline in brain glucose metabolism over time, while higher levels of cognitive activity were associated with less increase in amyloid deposition and less decline in brain glucose metabolism.

41331355,Posterior rectus sheath hernia: a case series with emphasis on imaging findings.,"Posterior rectus sheath hernia (PRSH) is a rare interparietal hernia that is often undetected or misdiagnosed on imaging. We conducted a retrospective review of a case series to define the specific imaging findings and clinical features associated with these hernias.We retrospectively reviewed our institution's imaging and surgical databases to identify patients with PRSH. Cases meeting strict diagnostic criteria of focal defect of the posterior rectus sheath with herniation into the rectus sheath and without features of a lateral (Spigelian) hernia-were included. Clinical presentation, imaging modality, hernia contents, and management were recorded.Seven patients with PRSH were identified (five spontaneous, two post-surgical). Presentations ranged from incidental, asymptomatic findings to abdominal pain and gastrointestinal obstruction symptoms. Contrast-enhanced CT was the primary imaging modality. Hernia contents included omentum, properitoneal fat and small bowel. While most patients did not require operative intervention, one patient had incarcerated small bowel through a ~ 1 cm posterior sheath defect and required surgical repair.PRSH is a rare interparietal hernia that often goes undetected. Radiologists should evaluate the posterior rectus sheath on CT and MRI for presence of PRSH. Careful description of the rectus sheath defect and its contents-particularly bowel-can guide appropriate management and distinguish cases needing surgical referral from those managed nonoperatively.© 2025.

41329382,Risk of Intestinal and Extraintestinal Malignancies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease With and Without Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While both conditions independently increase cancer risk, the comparative burden of cancer in patients with coexisting IBD and PSC (IBD-PSC), isolated IBD, and isolated PSC remains inadequately defined.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX nationwide electronic health records database. Patients with IBD-PSC were compared to individuals with isolated IBD and isolated PSC. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to balance key baseline characteristics across groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies across three pairwise comparisons: IBD-PSC vs isolated IBD, IBD-PSC vs isolated PSC, and isolated PSC vs isolated IBD.After matching, 4,187 patients were included in each of the IBD-PSC and isolated IBD groups. IBD-PSC was associated with increased risks of colorectal cancer (aHR 4.01, 95% CI: 2.79-5.75, p < 0.001), cholangiocarcinoma (aHR 27.54, 95% CI: 15.05-50.38, p < 0.001), liver cancer (aHR 13.41, 95% CI: 7.42-24.26, p < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (aHR 2.37, 95% CI: 1.18-4.76, p = 0.013), and gallbladder cancer (aHR 36.26, 95% CI: 4.94-266.23, p < 0.001). Compared to isolated PSC, IBD-PSC had higher risks of colorectal (aHR 5.72, 95% CI: 3.17-10.31, p < 0.001) and gallbladder cancer (aHR 4.14, 95% CI: 1.69-10.14, p = 0.001).IBD-PSC is associated with substantially elevated risks of both intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies compared to isolated IBD or PSC. These findings highlight the synergistic oncogenic potential of coexisting IBD and PSC and underscore the need for tailored surveillance and early detection strategies in this high-risk population.© 2025.

40990886,"Global, Regional, and National Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors in 204 Countries and Territories, 1990-2023.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and are among the foremost causes of disability globally. CVD burden has continued to increase in most countries since 1990, with trends driven by changing exposures to harmful risk factors, population growth, and population aging.We report estimates of global, national, and subnational CVD burden, including 18 subdiseases and 12 associated modifiable risk factors. We analyzed change in CVD burden from 1990 to 2023 and identified drivers of change including population growth, population aging, and risk factor exposure.The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, a multinational collaborative research study, quantified burden due to 375 diseases including CVD burden and identified drivers of change from 1990 to 2023 using all available data and statistical models. GBD 2023 estimated the population-level burden of diseases in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023.CVDs were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths estimated in the GBD. As of 2023, there were 437 million (95% UI: 401 to 465 million) CVD DALYs globally, a 1.4-fold increase from the number in 1990 of 320 million (292 to 344 million). Ischemic heart disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and hypertensive heart disease were the leading cardiovascular causes of DALYs in 2023 globally. As of 2023, age-standardized CVD DALY rates were highest in low and low-middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI) settings and lowest in high SDI settings. The number of CVD deaths increased globally from 13.1 million (95% UI: 12.2 to 14.0 million) in 1990 to 19.2 million (95% UI: 17.4 to 20.4 million) in 2023. The number of prevalent cases of CVD more than doubled since 1990, with 311 million (95% UI: 294 to 333 million) prevalent cases of CVD in 1990 and 626 million (95% UI: 591 to 672 million) prevalent cases in 2023 globally. A total of 79.6% (95% UI: 75.7% to 82.5%) of CVD burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors 347 million [95% UI: 318 to 373 million] DALYs in 2023). Globally, high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and air pollution were the modifiable risks responsible for most attributable CVD burden in 2023. Since 1990, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors have had mixed effects on CVD burden, with increases in high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and low physical activity leading to higher burden, while reductions in tobacco usage have mitigated some of these increases. Population growth and population aging were the main drivers of the increasing burden since 1990, adding 128 million (95% UI: 115 to 139 million) and 139 million (95% UI: 126 to 151 million) CVD DALYs to the increase in CVD burden since 1990.CVD remains the leading cause of disease burden and death worldwide with the greatest burden in low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions. Large variation exists in CVD burden even for countries at similar levels of development, a gap explained substantially by known, modifiable risk factors that are inadequately controlled. The decades-long increase in CVD burden was the result of population growth, population aging, and increased exposure to a subset of risk factors led by metabolic risks. Countries will need to adopt effective health system and public health strategies if they are to progress in achieving global goals to reduce the burden of CVD.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

This highlights the need for countries to implement effective strategies to address these risk factors and reduce the burden of CVDs."
41092105,Analytical Error of Cardiac Troponin and Impact on the Performance of Accelerated Diagnostic Protocols in Patients with Acute Chest Pain.,"This study simulates how assay-specific bias influences the diagnostic performance of 0/1-h accelerated diagnostic protocols (ADPs) for 3 different high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays.We included 1493 patients presenting with chest pain. hs-cTnT (Roche Diagnostics), hs-cTnI from Abbott Diagnostics (hs-cTnI-A), and Siemens Healthineers (hs-cTnI-S) were measured at admission. The absolute total error observed in a state-of-the-art EQA study were added to the admission concentrations, producing 6 new variables being adjusted for maximum possible bias (if analytical variation is 0) (+biasmean, +biasmax95%CI, +biasmin95%CI, -biasmean, -biasmax95%CI, -biasmin95%CI). The influence of this ""worst-case scenario"" bias was compared after calculating sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and rule-out proportion for 30-day myocardial infarction or death for the observed and bias-adjusted hs-cTn concentrations.For 0-h rule-out, hs-cTnI-S and hs-cTnT had a sensitivity of >99.0%, compared to 97.7% for hs-cTnI-A. After adding the bias, sensitivity was unchanged for hs-cTnI-S (99.5%), but lower for hs-cTnT (95.5%), and hs-cTnI-A (96.2%). For the 0-/1-h algorithm, adding bias reduced sensitivity to 95.5% for hs-cTnT, while both hs-cTnI algorithms were unchanged (100.0%). Rule-out proportions for 0 h ranged from 0% to 60.0% for hs-cTnT, 28.2%-62.7% for hs-cTnI-A, and 3.5%-35.5% for hs-cTnI-S. For the 0-/1-h algorithm, ranges were 57.7%-75.8% (hs-cTnT), 52.8%-67.5% (hs-cTnI-A), and 45.7%-61.2% (hs-cTnI-S).Analytical bias of hs-cTn assays affects the clinical rule-out rate of the 0/1-h ADPs more than the diagnostic sensitivity. Bias may have a greater influence on the proportion of patients requiring hospital admission and may contribute to the heterogeneity of the reported rule-out rates of current ADPs.

41326865,Factors influencing immediate post-angiographic occlusion outcomes in intracranial aneurysms treated with the woven endobridge device: a multi-center analysis and predictive model from the WorldWideWEB consortium.,"The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device treats wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms, but occlusion rates vary. This study aims to identify factors associated with immediate WEB device occlusion. Data from patients treated with WEB devices across 36 sites were analyzed. Machine learning algorithms and ordinal regression models were developed to predict immediate incomplete occlusion for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. The study included 1565 patients, with 436 ruptured and 1129 unruptured aneurysms. Immediate complete occlusion was achieved in 38.3% of ruptured and 32.8% of unruptured aneurysms. For ruptured aneurysms, the CatBoost classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.69. Key predictors of incomplete occlusion included pretreatment mRS, aneurysm diameter, and MCA location. Ordinal regression revealed that smoking history (OR: 1.95, p < 0.001), neck diameter (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.50, p < 0.001), and presence of a branch from the aneurysm (OR: 2.06, p = 0.016) were associated with incomplete, while bifurcation aneurysms (OR: 0.55, p = 0.017) were associated with complete immediate occlusion. For unruptured aneurysms, the CatBoost classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.68. Significant predictors of immediate incomplete occlusion included aneurysm neck width, MCA location, and presence of daughter sac. Ordinal regression revealed that smoking history (OR: 1.29, p = 0.032), neck diameter (OR: 1.24, p < 0.001), and presence of a daughter sac (OR: 1.53, p = 0.005) were associated with incomplete, while bifurcation aneurysms (OR: 0.71, p = 0.02) and posterior circulation location (OR: 0.68, p = 0.01) were associated with complete immediate occlusion. Careful evaluation of patient demographics and specific aneurysm characteristics may help improve the outcomes of intracranial aneurysms treated with WEB device.© 2025.

41329001,Involvement of a tick-borne orthomyxovirus matrix protein in vRNP nuclear export.,"Thogotoviruses are arthropod-borne viruses belonging to the genus Thogotovirus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. Like other orthomyxoviruses, such as the influenza A viruses (IAV), thogotoviruses replicate in the nucleus. As a result, progeny viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) must be exported to the cytoplasm prior to virion assembly and budding at the plasma membrane. In IAV, this export depends on binding of the viral nuclear export protein (NEP) to the cellular exportin chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1). In contrast, the mechanism of vRNP nuclear export, including identification of a protein with NEP functionality, has not been characterized for any thogotoviruses. Here, we characterized vRNP nuclear export in Dhori virus (DHOV), a prototypic member of the Thogotovirus genus. DHOV replication and nuclear export of the viral nucleoprotein were inhibited by the canonical CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), suggesting that DHOV vRNP export also utilizes CRM1. Interestingly, LMB treatment led to nuclear retention of the DHOV matrix (M) protein in both infected and transfected cells. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, we found that DHOV M interacts with CRM1 through a nuclear export sequence (NES) located between amino acids 111 and 128. Mutation of hydrophobic residues within this NES reduced M-CRM1 interaction, abolished the NES phenotype when fused to a fluorescent protein, and impaired rescue of recombinant DHOV by reverse genetics. Together, our results reveal that DHOV vRNP nuclear export is CRM1-dependent and mediated by the M protein rather than a dedicated NEP-like protein, providing the first mechanistic insight into vRNP egress in the genus Thogotovirus.Dhori virus (DHOV) is a pathogenic tick-borne virus in the genus Thogotovirus, in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Despite evidence of DHOV exposure in various mammals, including humans, its basic biology is not well understood. We investigated how DHOV's progeny genome and protein complexes-viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs)-are transported out of the nucleus. Our findings show that DHOV, like the influenza viruses, uses the cellular protein chromosomal maintenance protein 1 (CRM1) for vRNP export. We found that chemically inhibiting CRM1 completely blocked DHOV vRNP export, preventing the production of progeny viruses from infected cells.

41329556,Contextual Analysis and Implementation Strategies for an Age-Friendly Emergency Department Uptake: The FRED Study Protocol.,"Older adults frequently present to the Emergency Department (ED). In response, a Swiss university hospital introduced age-friendly interventions and achieved Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation (GEDA) by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). However, the impact of previously introduced interventions and the reasons behind emergency clinicians' varying uptake or lack of continued use remain unclear. To further improve patient outcomes, conducting a contextual analysis to identify implementation barriers and facilitators is crucial, followed by the development of tailored implementation strategies supporting the sustainable uptake of all age-friendly program elements. The project's overall aim is to systematically promote the uptake and sustainable re-implementation of the existing age-friendly ED program. The first study phase outlined in this protocol (""Phase A"") focuses on 2 key objectives: (1) to assess current age-friendly interventions in the ED and identify barriers and facilitators affecting their reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance; (2) to develop tailored implementation strategies for re-implementing program elements.This project uses a modified implementation mapping in 5 Steps across 2 Phases. Phase A includes Steps 1-4: (1) conducting a contextual analysis using a mixed-methods design combining observations, interviews, patient chart reviews, E-survey and a Gemba walk; (2) identifying expected intervention and implementation outcomes, performance objectives; (3) adapting, extending, or developing tailored implementation strategies based on the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change taxonomy; and (4) co-designing an implementation protocol to guide re-implementation. The follow-up Phase B will involve the re-implementation of the intervention elements and co-designing the evaluation protocol (Step 5) for the implementation process.Age-friendly EDs are essential for person-centered emergency care, enhancing safety and quality of care for older adults. This study will provide insights into adaptable, evidence-informed implementation strategies that support behavioral change among emergency clinicians to increase patient reach and sustainability of age-friendly interventions for complex ED settings.© 2025 The Author(s).

41329562,Evaluation of the accuracy and readability of large language model responses on menopause and hormone therapy.,"Generative artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is now being explored in health care to support patient and clinician education. This study evaluated the accuracy, completeness, and readability of four large language models (LLMs): ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini, ChatGPT 4.0, and OpenEvidence in answering questions about menopause and hormone therapy.A total of 35 questions (20 patient-level, 15 clinician-level) were entered into each LLM. OpenEvidence was only used for clinician-level questions. Four blinded expert reviewers rated responses as accurate and complete, accurate but incomplete, or inaccurate. Readability of patient-level responses was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and word count. Analysis used ANOVA for readability, odds ratios for accuracy comparisons.For patient-level questions, ChatGPT 3.5 achieved the highest accuracy (70%), followed by ChatGPT 4.0 (60%) and Gemini (30%); Gemini had significantly lower odds of accuracy compared with ChatGPT 3.5 (OR=0.18, 95% CI=0.05-0.71; P=0.014). FRES scores differed significantly (P<0.001): Gemini scored 38.9±7.3 (""difficult""), ChatGPT 3.5 scored 31.0±11.2, and ChatGPT 4.0 scored 26.5±8.6 (both ""very difficult"").

41329901,FLIPI24: A Modern Prognostic Model and Clinical Trial Enrichment Tool for Newly Diagnosed Follicular Lymphoma.,"Although most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) can expect an indolent course, progressive lymphoma remains the primary cause of death during the first decade after diagnosis. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of starting first-line (1L) immunochemotherapy defines a high-risk population with poor survival, but better risk stratification at diagnosis is needed.The FLIPI24 model was developed and internally validated to predict 24-month event rates using individual data from 4,485 patients treated with 1L immunochemotherapy from 10 observational cohorts of FL. Overall and cause-specific survival was further evaluated in FLIPI24 risk groups. External validation in the 1L immunochemotherapy setting was performed using the prospective observational Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort (N = 565) and three randomized phase III trials (N = 3,192); extension to all patients with FL (any 1L therapy) was performed in the LEO cohort (N = 1,445) and its Molecular Epidemiology Resource subcohort (N = 1,074).The FLIPI24 model uses age and four blood-based variables (hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and WBC count). FLIPI24 showed consistent performance across validation and extension data sets, which was superior to existing prognostic tools. Across the four external immunochemotherapy validation data sets, patients with high-risk FLIPI24 (23%-32% of patients) had significantly higher 24-month event rates (22%-35%) and inferior 5-year overall survival (77%-83%) compared with patients with low-risk FLIPI24 (29%-31% of patients, 24-month event rates: 10%-12%; 5-year OS: 96%-97%). Results were consistent when evaluating lymphoma-related death and when extended to all patients with FL.The FLIPI24 model robustly stratifies, at diagnosis, patients with FL at increased risk of lymphoma-related death versus patients with very low lymphoma-related mortality during the first decade after diagnosis.

41330695,Preoperative biopsy is not associated with overall survival in patients with surgically resected localized thymoma.,"Society guidelines discourage biopsy of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) due to the perceived risk of local seeding or pleural dissemination. However few studies have evaluated this concern, and the true risk of preoperative biopsy remains unknown.We queried the United States' National Cancer Database for adults with localized TETs who underwent upfront R0 thymectomy 2004-2015. Use of preoperative biopsy over time was assessed with the Cochran-Armitage test. Postoperative outcomes were compared with chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods.We identified 1,056 patients. The median age was 61 years; 47% (492) were male. Use of preoperative percutaneous biopsy increased 2006-2015 from 18% to 33% (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent biopsy had larger tumors [median 6.6 vs 5.0 cm], more open operations [72% (150) vs 62% (331)] and regional lymphadenectomies [44% (118) vs 33% (250)], and a longer length of hospitalization (median 4 vs 3 days). Thirty-day mortality was similar between the groups. There was no difference in 10-year OS between the biopsy and no-biopsy groups [75% (95% CI 69%-82%) vs 76% (95% CI 73%-80%), p = 0.8]. After adjusting for age, sex, primary payor, histology, and tumour size, OS was similar between the biopsy and no-biopsy groups [AHR 0.97 (95% CI 0.72-1.29), p = 0.9].In this analysis of patients with localized TETs undergoing upfront R0 thymectomy, preoperative biopsy is not associated with worse overall survival. More study is needed to further explore whether biopsy increases risk of recurrence.© The Author(s) 2025.

41330929,DDX6 undergoes phase separation to modulate metabolic plasticity and chemoresistance.,"Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs), assembled via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), are critical for spatial regulation of gene expression in the cytoplasm. However, their roles in tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) as the most promising vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screenings using a specialized library targeting RNA-binding proteins enriched in SGs and PBs. Knockout (KO) of DDX6 significantly delays leukemogenesis with minimal impact on normal hematopoiesis. Importantly, the functions of DDX6 in AML depend largely on its ability to trigger LLPS and PB assembly. Mechanistically, PBs serve as ""reservoirs"" for the mRNAs interacting directly with DDX6 and having low GC content. DDX6 KO leads to rapid PB dissolution and release of PB-enriched mRNAs, such as BCAT1, into the cytosol, where these transcripts undergo degradation. By reducing BCAT1 levels, DDX6 KO reprograms amino acid metabolism and sensitizes AML cells to cytarabine chemotherapy.© 2025.

41331135,MASCC oncodermatology clinical practice statement: prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis with Mepitel Film and Hydrofilm.,"Acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) is a frequent and burdensome complication of radiotherapy (RT), particularly in patients with breast and head and neck cancers. Film dressings, such as Mepitel Film and Hydrofilm, have emerged as effective prophylactic interventions for reducing ARD severity. This Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice statement (CPS) aims to provide practical, evidence-based guidance for the prevention and management of ARD using these film dressings.The CPS was developed through a literature review and expert consensus within the MASCC Oncodermatology Study Group. Recommendations were formulated addressing key aspects of film dressing use, including patient selection, timing of application, skin preparation, dressing technique, product choice, and monitoring.Evidence from systematic review, network meta-analysis, and multiple RCTs indicates that Mepitel Film and Hydrofilm can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of ARD. Reduction is most prominent for moist desquamation in patients undergoing RT for breast and selected head and neck cancers. Practical guidance was established for identifying suitable patient groups, optimising application techniques, managing adherence challenges, and ensuring safe and effective use throughout the RT courses.Prophylactic use of Mepitel Film and Hydrofilm is recommended for reducing the severity of ARD in breast cancer and selected head and neck cancer patients. Clinical implementation should be individualised, considering anatomical factors, patient tolerance, and institutional resources.© 2025.

40754790,Developing a novel algorithm to identify incident and prevalent dementia in Medicare claims-the ARIC Study.,"There is an urgent need to improve dementia ascertainment robustness in real-world studies assessing drug effects on dementia risk. We developed algorithms to dementia identification algorithms using Medicare claims (inpatient/outpatient/prescription) from 3318 Visit 5 (2011-2013) and 1828 Visit 6 (2016-2017) participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, validated against ARIC's rigorous syndromic dementia classification. Algorithm performance was compared to existing algorithms (Jain, Bynum, Lee). We further evaluated algorithms effectiveness in a 20% random Medicare sample aged ≥70 years who initiating liraglutide or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) to assess 3-year adjusted risk difference (aRD) for dementia. Our incident dementia algorithm required two dementia diagnostic codes within 1-year, or one dementia code plus a new dementia prescription within 90 days. It achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 69.2%, specificity of 99.0%, and sensitivity of 34.6% (population prevalence: 8.8%), comparable to extant algorithms (PPV, 58.7-68.6%; sensitivity 25.5-40.4%). Prevalent dementia algorithm (without requiring incident diagnoses/prescriptions) demonstrated similar performance. In the Medicare sample, dementia risk ranged from 3.0% to 12.5%, aRD comparing liraglutide to DPP4i varied -1.2% to -3.6%, with our algorithm closely matching the Bynum algorithm.
