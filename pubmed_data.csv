41270809,Pharmacogenomic Testing.,"Clinical laboratories are increasingly implementing pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing. Although PGx is similar to genetic testing for other indications, there are unique aspects that laboratories should consider.To aid clinical laboratories that are implementing clinical PGx testing by describing characteristics of PGx test design and validation, as well as approaches to reporting. Resources that are useful for clinical laboratories performing PGx testing will be highlighted.The College of American Pathologists formed a workgroup composed of laboratorians with expertise in clinical PGx testing. The workgroup included representatives from the Association for Molecular Pathology and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The workgroup reviewed pertinent literature, as well as experience from proficiency testing and from members' laboratories.The workgroup recommends that laboratories implementing PGx consider the following concepts: testing platform, test design (ie, selection of pharmacogenes and variants/alleles), use of reference materials during test development and as controls during clinical runs, star allele and standard nomenclature systems, translations from genotype to predicted phenotype, and considerations for result reporting including making medication recommendations. The workgroup provides considerations when using report vendors, emphasizing the clinical laboratory's role and responsibility when implementing such reporting tools from vendors.Clinical laboratories should be familiar with the fundamentals of PGx, ensure that PGx testing meets the applicable regulatory requirements for all aspects of the clinical laboratory testing process, and follow recommendations for standardization of nomenclature and reporting.© 2025 College of American Pathologists.",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,"Nov 22, 2025",2025,Nov,22,Ji Y|Brunk L|Bove B|Danyal K|Langman L J|Mot N|Mroz P|Natowicz M|Reddi H|Shirts B|Smock K|Wool G D|Zhang B M|Moyer A M,Langman L J|Moyer A M,"From the Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City (Ji, Smock).|Proficiency Testing, College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois (Brunk, Mot).|self-employed, consultant LDT/PGx, Wilmington, Delaware (Bove).|the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington (Danyal).|the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (Langman, Moyer).|the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (Mroz).|Division of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (Natowicz).|Clinical Operations, Belay Diagnostics, Chicago, Illinois (Reddi).|the Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee (Shirts).|the Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois (Wool).|the Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California (Zhang).","Ji Y, Brunk L, Bove B, Danyal K, Langman L J, Mot N, Mroz P, Natowicz M, Reddi H, Shirts B, Smock K, Wool G D, Zhang B M, Moyer A M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41270809/,"This research provides guidance for clinical laboratories on implementing pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, which can help personalize medication treatment based on a person's genetic makeup.

41269781,CHARM is Prognostic of Geriatric Morbidity and Toxicity after Allogeneic Transplant for Older Adults: BMT CTN 1704 Study.,"Despite concerns about the toxicity of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in older patients, prospective data are limited characterizing prevalence or risk-stratification for geriatric morbidity such as disability or frailty. We prospectively assessed the prognostic impact of the novel composite health assessment risk model (CHARM), a score established to predict 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM), among 1105 patients aged ≥60 years enrolled on the Bone Marrow Transplant-Clinical Trials Network Study 1704. Secondary endpoints were assessed post-alloHCT at day (D) 100, 180 and 365 in multivariable models adjusted with predetermined clinical variables. Among alloHCT survivors, the prevalence of disability by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), frailty by the Physical Frailty Phenotype and physical function impairment by PROMIS was highest at D100, and lower D180 and D365. Higher CHARM scores were independently associated with greater IADL disability [coefficient=-0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.85 to -0.43, p<0.001], increased frailty (coefficient=0.19, CI: 0.081 to 0.31, p<0.001), worse PROMIS physical function, greater PROMIS depression, increased serious organ toxicity by D100, more cognitive decline at D100, higher mortality after acute GVHD but not significantly associated with PROMIS anxiety or acute GVHD. Higher CHARM score predicted for worse disability-free survival (OR = 2.03, CI: 1.66 - 2.48, p<0.001) and lower frailty-free survival (OR =2.00, CI: 1.61 - 2.49). In summary, CHARM is an independent prognostic scoring system not only for NRM, but also for geriatric morbidity and functional limitation-free survival through 1-year after alloHCT. Pre-alloHCT CHARM is a novel tool to aid shared decision-making for older patients.

41269206,Medical Management and Revascularization for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis.,"Improvements in medical therapy, carotid-artery stenting, and carotid endarterectomy call into question the preferred management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Whether adding revascularization to intensive medical management would provide greater benefit than intensive medical management alone is unclear.We conducted two parallel, observer-blinded clinical trials that enrolled patients with high-grade (≥70%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis across 155 centers in five countries. The stenting trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid-artery stenting plus intensive medical management (stenting group); the endarterectomy trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid endarterectomy plus intensive medical management (endarterectomy group). The primary outcome was a composite of any stroke or death, assessed from randomization to 44 days, or ipsilateral ischemic stroke, assessed during the remaining follow-up period up to 4 years.A total of 1245 patients underwent randomization in the stenting trial and 1240 in the endarterectomy trial. In the stenting trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 to 8.3) in the medical-therapy group and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.3) in the stenting group (P = 0.02 for the absolute difference). In the endarterectomy trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.3 to 7.4) in the medical-therapy group and 3.7% (95% CI, 2.1 to 5.5) in the endarterectomy group (P = 0.24 for the absolute difference). From day 0 to 44, in the stenting trial, no strokes or deaths occurred in the medical-therapy group and seven strokes and one death occurred in the stenting group; in the endarterectomy trial, three strokes occurred in the medical-therapy group and nine strokes occurred in the endarterectomy group.Among patients with high-grade stenosis without recent symptoms, the addition of stenting led to a lower risk of a composite of perioperative stroke or death or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years than intensive medical management alone. Carotid endarterectomy did not lead to a significant benefit.

41269210,Upregulation of TNFR2 Precedes TOX Expression by Exhausted T cells and Restricts Antitumor and Antiviral Immunity.,"Exhaustion represents a collection of programmed T cell differentiation states and an important mode of T cell dysfunction. T cell progression from progenitor to terminal exhaustion is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor TOX. Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete.Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to evaluate expression of TNF receptors on human and murine tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to assess exhaustion markers and TNF receptors on CD8+ T cells. Bulk RNA sequencing was used to demonstrate the role of TNFR2 on the overall exhaustion profile. Finally, the effect of TNFR2 on the overall anti-tumor response was established using TNFR2 KO mice and an antagonist.We reveal that upregulation of TNFR2 coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Loss of TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and contain functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple subcutaneous and intracranial tumor models.Our data place TNFR2 signaling as a potential upstream regulator of TOX expression in T cells and propose TNFR2 antagonism as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy.",Clin Cancer Res,"Nov 21, 2025",2025,Nov,21,Hoyt-Miggelbrink A M|Waibl Polania J|Wachsmuth L|Lorrey S|Mohan A|Hardigan A|Blandford E|Lerner E|Wilkinson D|Hotchkiss K M|Cook S|Hemmers S|Patel A|Ayasoufi K|Fecci P,Ayasoufi K,"Duke University, Durham, United States.|Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.|Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, United States.|Duke University, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.|University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.","Hoyt-Miggelbrink A M, Waibl Polania J, Wachsmuth L, Lorrey S, Mohan A, Hardigan A, Blandford E, Lerner E, Wilkinson D, Hotchkiss K M, Cook S, Hemmers S, Patel A, Ayasoufi K, Fecci P",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41269210/,"The key finding of this medical research is that the upregulation of TNFR2 precedes the expression of TOX, a transcription factor associated with T cell exhaustion.

41269246,Vitamin C as an Epigenetic Gatekeeper of Osteogenesis and Skeletal Health - a New Perspective on an Ancient Molecule.,"Vitamin C has been long recognized as an important nutrient for skeletal biology, historically attributed to its role in collagen synthesis and connective tissue integrity. Recent studies, however, reveal vitamin C as a critical epigenetic regulator of cellular differentiation. As a required cofactor for α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, vitamin C controls the enzymatic activity of a broad array of histone and DNA demethylases, thereby modulating chromatin accessibility and driving cell-specific gene expression. This review provides a novel, integrated perspective that directly links vitamin C's epigenetic functions to osteogenesis and skeletal health, highlighting experimental evidence that redefines its role beyond collagen maturation and antioxidant defense, and elucidating its sex-dimorphic effects. Importantly, inadequate vitamin C status remains widespread across diverse socioeconomic groups even in Western countries, with low vitamin C intake associated to higher risk of osteoporosis and fractures in the elderly. Viewed through the dual lenses of epigenetic-mechanistic function and clinical relevance, vitamin C emerges as a central epigenetic determinant of skeletal health and a safe, low-cost, and scalable adjuvant to complement current bone therapies. Integrating nutrient epidemiology, clinical data and epigenetic-mechanistic insights may enable targeted interventions to enhance skeletal resilience, particularly in vulnerable populations.© The Author(s) 2025.

41269481,"Temporal trends in mortality attributable to atrial fibrillation among adults with acute renal failure in the United States, 1999-2024.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute renal failure (ARF) frequently coexist, creating a bidirectional pathophysiologic interaction that amplifies morbidity and mortality risks. Despite their clinical significance, nationwide trends in AF-associated mortality among patients with ARF remain underexplored in the United States.Using mortality data from the CDC WONDER database (1999-2024), we conducted a retrospective analysis of deaths among adults aged 25 years and older with AF (ICD-10: I48) and ARF (ICD-10: N17). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) were calculated per 100,000 population using the 2000 U.S. standard population. Temporal trends and annual percent changes (APCs) were assessed using Joinpoint regression analysis.From 1999 to 2024, 139,956 AF-ARF-associated deaths were recorded. AAMRs increased from 0.6 (95% CI 0.6-0.7) in 1999 to 5.0 (95% CI 4.9-5.1) in 2024, peaking during 2019-2022 (APC: + 34.55, p < 0.000001), followed by a significant decline (APC: - 8.55, p = 0.0036). Mortality remained consistently higher in men than women and was greatest among non-Hispanic Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives. The South and nonmetropolitan regions exhibited the highest regional mortality burdens. State-level disparities showed particularly elevated rates in Kentucky, South Carolina, and Washington.AF-associated mortality among individuals with ARF has risen dramatically over two decades, with a recent partial decline. Persistent sex, racial, and geographic disparities underscore the need for targeted prevention, early identification, and integrated cardio-renal management strategies to mitigate mortality in this high-risk population.© 2025.

41269503,Pulsed field ablation for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia: a systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis.,"Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is a novel, non-thermal technique for atrial fibrillation ablation that is currently under early investigation for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PFA in this setting.We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science for studies on PFA in PSVT, including atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) with concealed or manifest accessory pathways. Outcomes included acute ablation success, success at 1, 3, and 6 months, and procedural/postoperative adverse events (AEs). Proportions were pooled using a random-effects model with arcsine transformation to account for extreme values. Analyses were conducted using R (v4.3.2).Five prospective single-arm studies involving 202 patients were included. The pooled acute success rate was 99.98% (95% CI: 99.29-100), with sustained success at 1, 3, and 6 months. Procedural and postoperative AE rates were low: 0.92% (95% CI: 0.00-4.88) and 0.06% (95% CI: 0.00-0.87), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed 100% acute success in AVNRT and in AVRT with concealed pathways, with high sustained success at 6 months. In AVRT with manifest pathways, acute success was 97.5% (95% CI: 84.74-100), maintained through follow-up.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PFA demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy for the treatment of PSVT. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish the outcomes of PFA in this setting relative to thermal ablation.© 2025.

41269777,Real-World Comparative Effectiveness of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma.,"This real-world retrospective cohort study evaluated utilization and comparative effectiveness of covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (cBTKi) monotherapies in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL) from electronic health records in the United States. Adults with R/R MCL who received second- or third-line (2L/3L) zanubrutinib, acalabrutinib, or ibrutinib monotherapy, on or after January 1, 2018, were included. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used in adjusted Cox models to compare real-world time-to-next treatment (rwTTNT) and overall survival (rwOS). Among 698 patients who received 2L/3L cBTKi monotherapy, 49%, 32%, and 19% received acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, and zanubrutinib, respectively. Unadjusted analyses showed median rwTTNT for 2L zanubrutinib, acalabrutinib, and ibrutinib was 14.5 (95%CI 11.0-23.2), 12.8 (95%CI 10.5-15.6), and 10.3 (95%CI 7.6-13.7) months and median rwOS was 26.4 (95%CI 23.2-not reached [NR]), 29.2 (95%CI 22.9-38.1), and 29.3 (95%CI 21.8-41.6) months, respectively. Median rwTTNT for 3L zanubrutinib, acalabrutinib, and ibrutinib was 21.1 (95%CI 3.9-NR), 9.2 (95%CI 6.8-14.7), and 9.6 (95%CI 4.8-18.0) months and median rwOS was NR (95%CI 27.3-NR), 27.4 (95%CI 15.1-42.2), and 27.0 (95%CI 15.6-NR) months, respectively. Adjusted models in the 2L/3L cohorts combined showed numerically longer rwTTNT and statistically significantly longer rwOS for zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib (hazard ratio 0.63, 95%CI 0.42-0.96), and trends for improved rwTTNT and rwOS for zanubrutinib over acalabrutinib. Toxicity was a frequent reason for changing to another cBTKi. These findings suggest potential improvements in rwTTNT and rwOS with the use of second- and next-generation cBTKis for R/R MCL from 2018 and beyond.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Hematology.",Blood advances,"Nov 21, 2025",2025,Nov,21,Phillips T J|Di M|Miller T|Wang J|Pierre A|Maglinte G A|Seymour E K|Wang Y,Wang Y,"City of Hope National Cancer Center, Duarte, California, United States.|University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.|University of Cincinnati, Fruitland Park, Florida, United States.|Flatiron Health, New York, New York, United States.|BeOne Medicines Ltd., San Carlos, California, United States.|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.","Phillips T J, Di M, Miller T, Wang J, Pierre A, Maglinte G A, Seymour E K, Wang Y",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41269777/,"This study compared the real-world effectiveness of three Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (zanubrutinib, acalabrutinib, and ibrutinib) in treating relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

41270148,Oculofacial plastic surgeons' attitudes towards sustainability in surgery.,"A survey of American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) members' opinions and attitudes towards sustainability in oculofacial plastic surgery practice was conducted. This represents the first survey on this topic that has been conducted within the subspeciality.An 11-point survey about sustainability practices was posted on the ASOPRS forum and sent via email to ASOPRS members who opted-in to receive surveys. Members were able to access the survey from November 2024 to January 2025, and all responses were submitted anonymously.A total of 114 surgeons started the survey. Of the 79 surgeons completing the survey, 68 were practicing oculofacial plastic surgeons, 10 were fellows-in-training and one was retired from clinical practice. Over 90% of respondents expressed concern about climate change and 93% agreed that the amount of waste generated during oculofacial plastic surgery is excessive.

41271731,Epithelial-mesenchymal cell competition coordinates fate transitions across tissue compartments during lung development and fibrosis.,"The coordination between epithelial progenitors and their mesenchymal niche is critical for organogenesis and repair, yet the mechanisms governing their competitive interactions remain unclear. Here, we reveal a paradigm of tissue-scale fitness sensing in the lung, where mesenchymal Yap levels antagonize epithelial Yap levels to dictate epithelial stem cell fate. We show that reduced fitness in alveolar fibroblasts (AF1s) via Yap/Taz or Myc deletion leads to their apoptotic elimination and a collapse of the alveolar stem cell niche. This niche collapse triggers a pathological competitive response from the epithelium, which undergoes aberrant bronchiolization that phenocopies human pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, we uncovered a molecular switch that controls mesenchymal fate. During development and fibrosis resolution, Snail1/2 sequesters Yap/Taz to drive an adipogenic program, generating niche-supportive AF1s. Conversely, Yap/Taz-TEAD-Myc binding instructs a myogenic, pro-fibrotic program. Our findings demonstrate that inter-tissue cell competition, governed by a Snail/Yap rheostat, orchestrates lung architecture and provides a framework for targeting the mesenchymal niche to treat fibrotic disease.© 2025.

41270242,Efficacy and Safety of Varied Bisphosphonate Therapy Dosing in Patients With Hypercalcemia of Malignancy.,"The difference in time to serum calcium normalization and rates of subsequent refractory hypocalcemia between bisphosphonates requires further investigation. Our primary objective was to assess the difference in normalization of serum calcium between pamidronate and zoledronic acid during treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) and rates of subsequent, refractory hypocalcemia following therapy.A retrospective review of patients with cancer who received pamidronate or zoledronic acid inpatient at Mayo Clinic for treatment of HCM between January 2018 and January 2024 was conducted. Logistic regression evaluated the association between treatment groups and outcomes. Multivariable modeling was adjusted for baseline differences, including severity of hypercalcemia.We evaluated 856 patients. The median age was 68 (IQR, 59-75) years, and 476 (55.6%) were male. The most common cancer diagnoses were lymphoma (n = 158, 18.5%), followed by multiple myeloma (n = 145, 16.9%) and lung cancer (n = 111, 13%). Overall, 292 (46.8%) patients and 154 (32.8%) patients achieved serum calcium normalization by hospital day 4 and day 7, respectively. The rate of normalization was similar between all bisphosphonates, regardless of pamidronate dose. Significantly higher rates of hypocalcemia were observed on day 4 for patients who received zoledronic acid 4 mg once compared with either dose (60 mg once and 90 mg once) of pamidronate (40.7% v 27.6% v 26.8%, P = .049, respectively). No significant difference in rates of hypocalcemia were observed on day 7 (56.8% v 50% v 42.9%, P = .26, respectively) and day 30 (39.1% v 39.0% v 37.5%, P = .50, respectively).Bisphosphonates were equally efficacious in normalizing serum calcium in patients with HCM.

41270274,Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist therapy on vertebral bone mineral density as measured by CT-based Hounsfield units.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are established therapeutics for weight loss that are increasingly used for BMI optimization prior to spine surgery. However, emerging evidence has suggested that GLP-1 agonists might reduce bone mineral density (BMD), increasing the risk of postoperative biomechanical complications. CT-based Hounsfield units (HUs) have gained popularity as a method for measuring spinal BMD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GLP-1 agonist-induced weight loss on spinal BMD as measured by opportunistic CT-based HUs.Patients who were treated with any GLP-1 agonist (2017-2022) for > 3 months were retrospectively identified. Patient body weight (BW), BMI, and HU measurements in the L1 vertebral body were measured before and after GLP-1 therapy. Patients were grouped according to the percentage of weight loss during GLP-1 therapy. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean changes in spinal HUs across the groups.Among the 102 included patients, the mean ± standard error of the mean BW reduction was 14.5 ± 2.5 kg over 15.9 ± 1.2 months of GLP-1 agonist therapy. Of these, 7 patients (6.9%) lost > 20% BW (mean decrease of 31.9 ± 7.0 HU, p = 0.011), 14 (13.7%) lost 15%-20% BW (mean decrease of 19.1 ± 8.3 HU, p = 0.038), 14 (13.7%) lost 10%-15% BW (mean decrease of 12.2 ± 5.1 HU, p = 0.036), 24 (23.5%) lost 5%-10% BW (mean decrease of 15.7 ± 3.3 HU, p < 0.0001), 26 (25.5%) lost < 5% BW (mean decrease of 14.7 ± 6.0 HU, p = 0.022), and 17 (16.7%) gained BW during GLP-1 therapy (mean decrease of 6.3 ± 5.0 HU, p = 0.229). One-way ANOVA testing did not show a significant difference in HU reduction across the weight loss groups (F = 1.12, p = 0.355). In addition, there was a significant correlation between the decrease in L1 HUs and the duration of GLP-1 therapy (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001) but not the amount of weight loss (r = -0.18, p = 0.070). In the multivariate analysis, the duration of GLP-1 therapy (p = 0.032) was a significant independent predictor of vertebral HU reduction, but the amount of weight loss (p = 0.664) was not.Despite similar pretreatment BW and HU measurements, all weight loss groups had significant decreases in vertebral HUs following GLP-1 agonist therapy, with a significant correlation observed between HU reduction and treatment duration. This suggests that long-term GLP-1 agonist therapy can significantly diminish spinal BMD regardless of the amount of weight loss achieved.",Journal of neurosurgery.

41270277,When the tumor encases or displaces the abducens nerve: anatomically based strategies to prevent its injury in the retrosigmoid route.,"Lesions of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and petroclival region represent a challenging surgical target due to the complex anatomy of the involved neurovascular structures. In this scenario, cranial nerve (CN) VI is particularly exposed to potential injuries due to its deep-seated location and absence of a bony foramen that serves as a reference of its most distal cisternal point, especially when it is encased or displaced by large lesions. This study aimed to provide reliable operative guidance for preventing injuries to CN VI during the retrosigmoid approach to address CPA and petrotentorial lesions.Four formalin-fixed, latex-injected anatomical specimens were dissected to highlight and investigate the relevant anatomy of the CPA and petroclival region during the retrosigmoid approach. Additionally, 50 sides of noninjected formalin-fixed specimens were dissected for morphometric evaluation. Correlations between the petrotentorial junction (PTJ), porus acusticus (PA), and trigeminal impression (TI) with the entry point of CN VI into Dorello's canal were evaluated. An illustrative clinical case and a 3D anatomical model generated through the photogrammetry scanning technique were described.In the sagittal plane, CN VI entrance into Dorello's canal was found in a trajectory parallel to the PTJ, passing through the inferior aspect of the PA and 21.5 ± 1.3 mm anteriorly. In the coronal plane, the entry point of CN VI into Dorello's canal was estimated at 6.2 ± 1.2 mm from the anterior edge of the TI in a trajectory perpendicular to the PTJ in 47 (81%) specimens.The obtained results demonstrated two surgical strategies to locate Dorello's canal within the retrosigmoid route: 1) approximately 20 mm anterior along the inferior edge of the PA parallel to the PTJ; and 2) approximately 6 mm inferior to the anterior edge of the TI, perpendicular to the PTJ. The defined operative strategies provide reliable anatomical guidance to locate the entrance of CN VI into Dorello's canal within the retrosigmoid route, potentially reducing the risk of abducens nerve palsy and improving patient outcomes.",Journal of neurosurgery,"Nov 21, 2025",2025,Nov,21,Torregrossa F|Piazza A|Shinya Y|De Bonis A|Leonel L|Graepel S|Grasso G|Lanzino G|Link M J|Peris Celda M,Torregrossa F|Piazza A|Shinya Y|De Bonis A|Leonel L|Graepel S|Lanzino G|Link M J|Peris Celda M,"1Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|2Rhoton Neurosurgery and Otolaryngology Surgical Anatomy Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.|3Neurosurgical Unit, Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics (BiND), University of Palermo, Italy.|4Division of Neurosurgery, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.|5Department of Neurosurgery and Gamma Knife Radiosurgery, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.|6Department of Clinical Anatomy, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota.|7Department of Education, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and.|8Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","Torregrossa F, Piazza A, Shinya Y, De Bonis A, Leonel L, Graepel S, Grasso G, Lanzino G, Link M J, Peris Celda M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41270277/,"The study identified two reliable anatomical landmarks to locate the abducens nerve during a surgical approach to the cerebellopontine angle and petroclival region.

41271414,Which way? Group-based smoking and vaping cessation support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women: protocol for a non-randomised type 1 hybrid implementation study.,"Tobacco use is the most significant modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes, and early research indicates there are also significant harms associated with vaping. National targets aim to reduce smoking and vaping during pregnancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. While most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people want to quit, cessation is frequently attempted without support, increasing the chance of relapse. Group-based smoking cessation programmes increase quit success by 50%-130% in the general population; however, they have never been evaluated in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities.The Gulibaa study is an Indigenous-led and community-embedded project that will co-design, implement and evaluate a group-based model of care to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to be smoke- and vape-free. Staff of Health Services in New South Wales, Australia, will receive training to deliver a face-to-face group-based smoking and vaping cessation intervention. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people who identify as a woman or non-binary, are pregnant or of reproductive age (16 to 49 years), currently smoke or vape at least once per day and are willing to attend the programme are eligible to participate. Up to 500 participants will be recruited. A mixed method evaluation approach will be implemented guided by the RE-AIM framework. Outcomes will include intervention reach, intervention effectiveness (determined primarily by self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months follow-up), acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, programme fidelity and maintenance and cost effectiveness.Embedding culturally safe support to quit during pregnancy can result in improved outcomes for both mother and child and immediately improve intergenerational health and well-being. Ethics approval has been provided by the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council and the University of Newcastle. Study findings will be disseminated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in ways that are meaningful to them, as well as through Aboriginal health services, key national bodies, relevant state and federal government departments.ACTRN12625001050448.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

41268677,Fascial Border Absence Between the Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus and Brachioradialis Muscles.,"Ultrasound (US) guidance may ensure proper needle placement during electromyography (EMG) when assessing for suitable donor muscles for upper limb reconstruction. A distinct intermuscular fascial border aids in delineating the separation between the brachioradialis (BR) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) muscles. However, this border may be absent, making correct needle placement complex and assessment more difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe the presence and absence of this fascial border in healthy individuals to help with accurate EMG needle placement.Twenty healthy patients underwent sonographic examination by a single sonographer physician of the ECRL and BR to identify the presence or absence of the intermuscular fascial border.The fascial border that routinely separates the ECRL and BR was absent in at least one arm in 20% of subjects (12.5% of upper limbs). One subject had an absent fascial border in both upper limbs.US can assess for the presence or absence of intermuscular fascial borders. This assessment is important for accurate EMG needle placement and localization. While the clinical significance of an absent ECRL-BR fascial border is currently unknown, future studies should examine the effect of absent ECRL-BR fascial borders on wrist extension.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Muscle & nerve,"Nov 21, 2025",2025,Nov,21,Meiling J B|Wu K Y|Luetmer M T|Boon A J,Meiling J B|Wu K Y|Luetmer M T|Boon A J,"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.|Division of Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.","Meiling J B, Wu K Y, Luetmer M T, Boon A J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41268677/,"The key finding of this medical research is that the fascial border between the extensor carpi radialis longus and brachioradialis muscles is absent in 20% of healthy individuals, which can make it more difficult to accurately place electromyography needles during medical assessments.
