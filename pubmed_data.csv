41241792,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals T cell heterogeneity and metabolic reprogramming in human immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.,"Immune-mediated glomerulonephritis (IMGN) is a major cause of kidney failure worldwide, yet the precise roles of T cells in its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. However, existing studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and functional roles of IMGN T cells in the human context. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing targeted therapies. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) data from three primary IMGN types-IgA nephropathy (IgAN), lupus nephritis (LN), and membranous nephropathy (MN)-we identified T cell subtype alterations at single-cell resolution. Utilizing advanced sc-RNA-seq computational pipelines, we constructed gene co-expression networks (GCNs), inferred T-cell differentiation trajectories, and assessed metabolic and intercellular signaling features. IMGN kidneys presented expanded T-cell compartments, with significant enrichment of cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) cells and GZMK⁺ effector memory T (GZMK⁺ Tem) cells. Notably, LTB⁺ memory T cells (LTB⁺ Tm) were selectively elevated in IgAN and LN patients. A coexpression module centered on RGS1 was significantly correlated with 24-h proteinuria (p < 0.001). Metabolic profiling revealed subtype-specific disruptions in the glutathione (GSH) and 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate (3PD) pathways. Interaction analysis highlighted endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and fibroblasts as key mediators of pathogenic T-cell activation via defined ligand‒receptor pairs. This study provides the first comprehensive single-cell atlas of human IMGN T cells, revealing disease-specific T-cell states, metabolic signatures, and activation mechanisms. Our findings offer new insights into human renal immunopathology and identify promising therapeutic targets for IMGN.",Autoimmunity,"Dec 31, 2025",2025,Dec,31,Qing J|Zhao Y|Cheungpasitporn W|Miao J|Thongprayoon C|Wu H|Wu J,Cheungpasitporn W|Miao J|Thongprayoon C,"Department of Nephrology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.|Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.|Department of Nephrology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University (The First Hospital of Jiaxing), Jiaxing, China.","Qing J, Zhao Y, Cheungpasitporn W, Miao J, Thongprayoon C, Wu H, Wu J",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41241792/,"The study used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze T cell changes in three types of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis (IMGN), a major cause of kidney failure.

41056789,Chronological survival improvement over time with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus targeted agents in metastatic colorectal cancer: An ARCAD database study.,"The combination of oxaliplatin-based doublet chemotherapy and molecular targeted agents is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the temporal evolution of associated treatment outcomes is unclear. We utilized Aide et Recherche en Cancérologie Digestive (ARCAD) data to evaluate the chronological changes in clinical outcomes associated with this regimen in metastatic colorectal cancer.An individual patient data meta-analysis was performed using data from 5424 patients enrolled in 13 randomized controlled trials within the ARCAD database between 2004 and 2017. Eligible patients received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Intervals of 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2017 were examined. Overall, progression-free, and post-progression survivals were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for key prognostic factors.Median overall survival improved over time, from 21.4 months (2004-2008) to 28.6 months (2009-2013) and 29.7 months (2014-2017). Similar trends were observed for progression-free and post-progression survivals. Multivariable analysis confirmed the treatment period as an independent prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survivals. Subgroup analyses revealed improvements in overall survival for left-sided and RAS wild-type tumors, whereas minimal gains were found for right-sided or RAS-mutated tumors. Increased use of subsequent therapies contributed to prolonged post-progression survival.We demonstrated progressive improvements in survival outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus molecular targeted agents. The findings highlight the importance of biomarker-driven treatment strategies and the evolving role of subsequent therapies in optimizing clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

41241759,"Oxidative degradation of alpha-tocopherol by reactive oxygen species, identifying products, and product anticancer activity.","α-Tocopherol (α-TQ) is a potent antioxidant with diverse applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is susceptible to oxidation by various reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study first identifies the oxidation product of α-tocopherol produced by either H2O2 or HOCl, which could be formed in foods and biological systems. Second, the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of these oxidation reactions are characterized. Finally, the anticancer activity of α-TQ and its oxidation products was revealed. The direct oxidation product is α-tocopheryl quinone (α-TQQ), which dimerizes through an ether linkage and undergoes addition reactions. LC-MS/MS identified new products, primarily including positional and diastereoisomers of α-TQQ dimers resulting from H2O2 and HOCl addition. A kinetic study demonstrated that the oxidation reaction is first-order for both α-TQ and H2O2 or HOCl. The mechanism is proposed based on the identified products and kinetic behavior. The postulated mechanism also aligns with the reaction's UV-Vis spectra, including the formation of the hemiketal (242 nm) and α-TQQ (261 nm) intermediates, as well as the addition products of the α-TQQ dimer (265 nm). α-TQQ dimer products of H2O2 oxidation reaction exhibited 1.7-fold (IC50 264.72 µM) and 2.0-fold (IC50 253.72 µM) higher cytotoxicity than that of α-TQ (IC50 448.45 and 496.53 µM) against breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, respectively. These results indicate that natural α-TQ and its oxidation products, when administered at a suitable dose, can express protection against various types of cancer.© 2025.

41241390,Type III and type VI collagen neoepitopes are associated with disease severity in systemic sclerosis.,"Dysregulated collagen turnover is implicated in systemic sclerosis (SSc) pathogenesis. We evaluated collagen turnover biomarkers in relation to the severity of fibrotic manifestations, key cytokines, and progression in SSc.Baseline and 6-month serum samples of early SSc patients in the CONQUER cohort were analyzed for type III (PRO-C3 and C3M) and type VI (PRO-C6 and C6M) collagen turnover biomarkers, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon (IFN)-inducible proteins. The modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and forced vital capacity percent predicted (FVC%) served as surrogate markers of disease severity.222 patients were included. PRO-C3 (p<0.001) and PRO-C6 (p<0.001) concentrations were higher in patients with diffuse disease, while C6M (p=0.041) was higher in those with ILD. Baseline PRO-C3 (p<0.001) and PRO-C6 (p<0.001) positively correlated with mRSS, whereas C3M (p=0.029) and C6M (p=0.011) negatively correlated with FVC%, although the magnitude of the observed correlations was in the weak range (Rs<0.4). Collagen biomarker concentrations positively correlated with CRP, IL-6, and IFN-inducible proteins at baseline. While changes in CRP correlated positively with changes in collagen degradation protein levels (C3M and C6M), they did not correlate with changes in collagen formation protein levels (PRO-C3 and PRO-C6). In contrast, changes in IFN score showed the highest correlation with changes in PRO-C6.PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 correlated with skin disease severity, while C3M and C6M correlated with lung disease severity.

41236405,Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in the young (aged 50 years and younger): Divergent clinical and molecular characteristics from the elderly.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is largely a disease of individuals older than 50 years; its occurrence in patients aged 50 years and younger is rare. The authors sought to characterize the clinicopathologic features and genetic profile of young-onset (age 50 years and younger) CMML (y-CMML) compared with older onset (older than 50 years) CMML (o-CMML).The authors conducted a multi-institutional study of 32 patients with y-CMML and 119 patients with o-CMML, analyzing clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular data.Patients who had y-CMML frequently presented with splenomegaly (59% vs. 11%; p < .001) and hepatomegaly (25% vs. 2%; p < .001) compared with those who had o-CMML. Although the overall incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities was similar, patients who had y-CMML exhibited distinct mutational patterns. PTPN11 mutations were significantly more common in y-CMML (13% vs. 3%; p = .034) than in o-CMML, whereas TET2 (6% vs. 57%; p < .001) and SRSF2 (16% vs. 46%; p = .002) mutations were significantly less frequent. In addition, multi-hit TET2 (6% vs. 34%; p = .002) and TET2-SRSF2 (3% vs. 29%; p = .003) co-mutations were rare in y-CMML. However, the molecular differences did not affect the CMML-specific risk-stratification categories because the clinical outcomes, including overall survival and leukemia-free survival, did not differ between the two groups.CMML in patients aged 50 years and younger is rare and presents with unique clinical and mutational features, suggesting a distinct pathogenesis.© 2025 The Author(s).

41138791,"Image-based meta- and mega-analysis (IBMMA): A unified framework for large-scale, multi-site, neuroimaging data analysis.","The increasing scale and complexity of neuroimaging datasets aggregated from multiple study sites present substantial analytic challenges, as existing statistical analysis tools struggle to handle missing voxel-data, suffer from limited computational speed and inefficient memory allocation, and are restricted in the types of statistical designs they are able to model. We introduce Image-Based Meta- & Mega-Analysis (IBMMA), a novel software package implemented in R and Python that provides a unified framework for analyzing diverse neuroimaging features, efficiently handles large-scale datasets through parallel processing, offers flexible statistical modeling options, and properly manages missing voxel-data commonly encountered in multi-site studies. IBMMA successfully analyzed a large-n dataset of several thousand participants and revealed findings in brain regions that some traditional software overlooked due to missing voxel-data resulting in gaps in brain coverage.

41101875,The Role of Radiation Therapy in the Management of Gray Zone Lymphoma.,"Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) is a rare disease that currently has poor treatment outcomes. The role of radiation therapy (RT) in the management of GZL is not well established. This trial is the largest study to report on the outcomes of patients with GZL treated with and without RT.A retrospective review of 30 patients with GZL treated across 3 institutions from 2009 to 2021 was performed. Treatment response was assessed using end-of-treatment (EST) and/or interim (1) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography or computed tomography scans, per Lugano criteria. A complete response (CR) on an interim PET scan (Deauville score, 1-3) was a rapid-early-response, whereas a partial response (PR) on an interim PET scan without progression was a slow-early-response (SER). For EST assessment, a Deauville score of 1 to 3 was considered CR, and a score of 4 to 5 without progression was considered PR. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined from initiation of frontline chemotherapy to disease progression/relapse, initiation of salvage therapy, or death.At a median follow-up of 4 years, the 2-year EFS was 26% for all patients, 33% for RT, and 23% for no-RT (P = .44). The 2-year EFS based on EST was 46% and 10% for CR and PR, respectively (P = .004). Patients with PR to chemotherapy who received RT had significantly better 2-year EFS compared with those who did not (17% vs 0%, P = .007). Among patients with SER, RT was also associated with improved 2-year EFS (33% vs 13%, P = .038). Patients with bulky mediastinal disease had a 2-year EFS of 43% with RT versus 11% without RT (P = .08).Patients with GZL have a high risk of relapse, and RT improves EFS, particularly for patients with SER, PR, and bulky mediastinal disease.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40752653,"Long-Term Results of NRG/RTOG 9601, a Randomized Trial of Radiation With or Without Antiandrogens in Patients Receiving Salvage Prostate Bed Radiation Therapy Postprostatectomy.","Salvage radiation therapy (RT) is used in men with prostate cancer (PC) recurrence following radical prostatectomy signaled by a persistent or delayed elevation in prostate specific antigen. It was previously reported that the use of antiandrogen therapy (AAT) with RT improved cancer control and overall survival (OS). Long-term follow-up results are presented in this study.From 1998 to 2003, 760 eligible postradical prostatectomy patients with stage pT3N0 or with pT2N0 and positive margins and prostate specific antigen from 0.2 to 4.0 ng/mL were randomly assigned on a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of RT + placebo versus RT + AAT (24 months of bicalutamide, 150 mg daily) during and after RT (64.8 Gy in 36 fractions prostate bed). The primary endpoint was OS estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Time to PC death and metastatic PC (competing risk of death without an event) was estimated using cumulative incidence. The hazard ratio (HR) was obtained using Cox models (OS) and subdistribution HRs (sHRs) used the Fine-Gray model (time to PC death and metastatic PC).Median follow-up for surviving patients was 18.9 years. OS at 18 years was 53% (95% CI, 47%-58%) for RT + AAT and 43% (95% CI, 38%-49%) for RT + placebo (adjusted HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00; 1-sided P = .025). The 18-year incidence of centrally reviewed PC deaths was 18% (95% CI, 14%-22%) RT + AAT and 28% (95% CI, 23-33%) RT + placebo (unadjusted sHR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.84; 2-sided P = .002). The 18-year incidence of metastatic PC was 22% (95% CI, 18-26%) and 31% (95% CI, 26-36%) for AAT and placebo arms, respectively (unadjusted sHR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83; 2-sided P = .001).Long-term results of 24-month duration AAT during and after salvage RT are consistent with the primary report with significantly improved long-term OS, reduced incidence of metastatic PC, and PC death for RT + AAT. In comparison with previous reports, the improvement in OS with AAT has risen from 5% at 12 years to 9.8% at 18 years.Copyright © 2025.

40516619,Downregulated mitochondria-encoded long non-coding RNAs in mood disorders.,"Mitochondrial genome-encoded long non-coding RNAs (mt-LncRNAs) that play roles in regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, both crucial in mood disorder pathogenesis, yet remain poorly explored despite growing interest. This study examines their expression levels in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), siblings of individuals with BD (SIB), and healthy controls (HC).Blood samples from 153 participants (31 MDD, 40 BD, 39 SIB, 43 HC) were analyzed for 10 mt-LncRNAs via RT-qPCR. Samples from a subgroup of 15 remitted MDD (MDDREM) patients following 8-week treatment were included for exploratory analysis. A composite score for all LncRNAs, global factor, was derived using principal component analysis. All comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, BMI, and multiple comparisons.Global scores showed overall downregulation in MDD, BD, and SIB compared to HCs, with BD exhibiting the lowest levels (p < 0.01). All mt-LncRNAs were downregulated in BD and SIB, while 8 (excluding ASncmtRNA-2 and 7S RNA) were downregulated in MDD (p < 0.05). Mt-LncRNA levels were lower in BD than in SIB and MDD (p < 0.05), with 6 also lower in SIB compared to MDD (p < 0.05). Exploratory analysis revealed a significant increase in 8 mt-LncRNAs (excluding LIPCAR and 7S RNA) in MDDREM compared to baseline MDD (p < 0.05).Findings show a significant mt-LncRNA downregulation in mood disorders and suggest genetic transmission as well as a capacity to change with treatment. Further research is needed to explore the genetics and modifiability of mt-LncRNAs in mood disorders.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

40389098,"Hypofractionated Preoperative Radiation Therapy for Extremity and Superficial Trunk Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Results of a Prospective, Phase 2 Trial.","Preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for resectable extremity soft tissue sarcomas has historically been delivered over 5 weeks and associated with a 35% major wound complication (WC) rate. We investigated the rate of WC in a cohort of soft tissue sarcoma patients treated with a moderately hypofractionated course of preoperative RT.MC1973 was a single-arm, prospective, phase 2, noninferiority trial completed at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Arizona. We administered preoperative RT to 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions. Patients underwent standard of care tumor resection afterward. The primary endpoint was a major WC occurring within 120 days of surgery. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, Fisher Exact tests, and Conchran-Armitage Trend tests were used to evaluate associations with WC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to report early survival-associated outcomes.Between November 24, 2020 and January 30, 2024, 120 patients enrolled on trial. One patient withdrew before receiving treatment. Most common tumor location was proximal lower extremity (48.7%). After RT, 117 patients (97.5%) underwent tumor resection. Two patients treated with RT came off study before surgery because of death. A major WC developed in 27 of 117 patients (23.1%). Median time to WC resolution was 17.4 weeks. The rate of persistent WC at 6 months was 26%. On univariate analysis, leiomyosarcoma histology (n = 5) correlated with a higher WC rate (60%). Median follow-up was 21.1 months. Fourteen patients experienced acute grade 3 adverse events. One year disease-free survival was 86.0% (95% CI, 79.7%-92.9%). Two patients developed local recurrence. One fracture was observed.The major WC rate was 23.1% with a preoperative regimen of 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions. This suggests moderate hypofractionation is not inferior compared with historical standards of major WC rate. Additional follow-up will allow evaluation of oncologic outcomes, long-term treatment-associated adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.
