41076458,Novel targets beyond vascular endothelial growth factor-A inhibition: improving vision with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treatment.,Khanani AM; Bakri SJ; Regillo C; Weng CY; Wong TY; Baldwin ME; Han JJ; Leitch IM,,Eye (Lond),,2025 Oct 11,"{'main_findings': 'The paper explores novel therapeutic targets beyond vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibition for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). It highlights the potential of targeting other VEGF family members, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which may provide improved vision outcomes for patients compared to current standard-of-care VEGF-A inhibitors.', 'clinical_significance': 'Targeting VEGF-C and VEGF-D in addition to VEGF-A could lead to better visual acuity outcomes for patients with nAMD, who may not achieve optimal results with current VEGF-A inhibitor monotherapies. This could have significant implications for improving quality of life and reducing the burden of vision loss in this patient population.', 'methodology': 'This is a review article that discusses the role of the VEGF family of ligands and receptors in nAMD pathogenesis and the development of novel therapies targeting mediators beyond VEGF-A, such as the investigational trap biologic sozinibercept.', 'limitations': 'As a review, the article does not present original research data, and the efficacy and safety of the novel therapies discussed are still under investigation in clinical trials.', 'keywords': ['neovascular age-related macular degeneration', 'VEGF-A', 'VEGF-C', 'VEGF-D', 'novel therapeutics', 'vision outcomes'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"

41075055,Sinonasal Tract Osteochondromyxoma: An Underrecognized Tumor Easily Mistaken for Nasal Chondromesenchymal Hamartoma.,Bishop JA; Alani A; Fernandes IL; Bacchi CE; Klink DF; Marshall CB; Baumhoer D; Folpe AL,,Head Neck Pathol,,2025 Oct 11,"{'main_findings': 'Osteochondromyxoma (OCM) is a rare matrix-producing tumor that can occur in the sinonasal tract, often mistaken for other similar-appearing tumors like nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. The authors describe 6 new cases of sinonasal OCM, which presented in young patients with nasal obstruction and masses.', 'clinical_significance': 'Recognizing OCM as a distinct entity is important, as it is associated with the Carney complex genetic syndrome. Immunohistochemical demonstration of PRKAR1A loss can help confirm the diagnosis and prompt further clinical evaluation.', 'methodology': 'The authors retrospectively reviewed cases of sinonasal OCM from their surgical pathology files, describing the clinicopathologic features.', 'limitations': 'The study is limited by its retrospective nature and small sample size, as OCM is an extremely rare tumor. Long-term follow-up data was not available for all patients.', 'keywords': ['osteochondromyxoma', 'sinonasal tract', 'nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma', 'Carney complex', 'PRKAR1A'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"

41074561,Research Communication: Comparative Effectiveness of Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab in the Management of Chronic Pouchitis-A Population-Based Study.,Alsakarneh S; Tome J; Farraye FA; Pardi DS,,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,,2025 Oct 11,"{'main_findings': 'This real-world study found that ustekinumab was associated with significantly lower relapse rates, longer time to relapse, reduced hospitalizations, and decreased need for steroids or antibiotics compared to vedolizumab in the management of chronic pouchitis.', 'clinical_significance': 'These findings suggest that ustekinumab may offer advantages over vedolizumab for the treatment of chronic pouchitis, a major therapeutic challenge in patients with ulcerative colitis following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. This information can help guide clinicians in selecting the most appropriate biologic therapy for these patients.', 'methodology': 'This was a propensity-matched cohort study of 856 patients from a healthcare database, comparing the effectiveness of ustekinumab and vedolizumab in the management of chronic pouchitis.', 'limitations': 'The study was observational in nature, and there may be unmeasured confounding factors that could have influenced the results. Additionally, the study was limited to a single healthcare database, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.', 'keywords': ['chronic pouchitis', 'ulcerative colitis', 'ustekinumab', 'vedolizumab', 'biologic therapy'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"

It shows that cancer is a leading cause of death globally, with a disproportionate burden in low- and middle-income countries. The study also estimates the cancer burden attributable to various risk factors.', 'clinical_significance': 'The findings highlight the need for comprehensive national and international efforts to address the growing cancer burden, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This includes developing and implementing effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies tailored to local contexts.', 'methodology': 'The study used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate estimates of cancer burden, including incidence, mortality, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years. It also used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate cancer burden attributable to various risk factors.', 'limitations': 'The study relies on data from various sources, including population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsies, which may have varying levels of completeness and accuracy across different countries and regions. The forecasting methods also rely on assumptions about future trends in risk factor exposures and other sociodemographic factors.', 'keywords': ['cancer burden', 'global health', 'risk factors', 'low- and middle-income countries', 'cancer prevention and control'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"
