41082215,Slow-Tempo Music and Delirium/Coma-Free Days Among Older Adults Undergoing Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Khan BA; Khan SH; Perkins AJ; Heiderscheit A; Unverzagt FW; Wang S; Downs JH 3rd; Gao S; Chlan LL,,JAMA Intern Med,,2025 Oct 13,"{'main_findings': 'This randomized clinical trial found that a slow-tempo music intervention did not significantly decrease delirium duration, delirium severity, pain, or anxiety symptoms in older adults undergoing mechanical ventilation compared to a control group.', 'clinical_significance': 'The results suggest that a slow-tempo music intervention may not be an effective strategy for managing delirium and associated symptoms in this patient population. Healthcare providers should consider other evidence-based interventions to address delirium in critically ill older adults.', 'methodology': 'This was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 158 older adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomized to receive either a slow-tempo music intervention or a control intervention (listening to silence) for up to 7 days. The primary outcome was delirium/coma-free days, and secondary outcomes included delirium severity, pain, and anxiety.', 'limitations': 'The study was limited by its relatively small sample size and short intervention period. Additionally, the study did not assess the long-term impact of the music intervention on patient outcomes.', 'keywords': ['delirium', 'mechanical ventilation', 'music intervention', 'older adults', 'critical care'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"
41082199,Posttreatment Amyloid Levels and Clinical Outcomes Following Donanemab for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,Lu M; Kim MJ; Collins EC; Shcherbinin S; Ellinwood AK; Yokoi Y; Brooks DA; Hansson O; Knopman DS; Sims JR; Mintun MA,,JAMA Neurol,,2025 Oct 13,"{'main_findings': ""This secondary analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial found that lower posttreatment amyloid levels in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease were correlated with slower clinical progression, as measured by cognitive and functional assessments, as well as decreases in certain biomarkers like phosphorylated tau."", 'clinical_significance': ""These findings support amyloid plaque removal as the mechanism of action for donanemab treatment and suggest that posttreatment amyloid levels could be used as a surrogate biomarker to predict clinical benefit in amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease."", 'methodology': ""This was a post hoc exploratory analysis of the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which included 1,582 participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who were randomized to receive donanemab or placebo. Participants were categorized into deciles based on their lowest posttreatment amyloid level, and correlations were assessed between amyloid levels and clinical outcomes as well as plasma biomarkers."", 'limitations': ""This was a secondary analysis, and the findings need to be confirmed in a prospective study designed to specifically evaluate the relationship between posttreatment amyloid levels and clinical outcomes. The study population was limited to those with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, so the results may not be generalizable to all stages of the disease."", 'keywords': [""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid', 'donanemab', 'biomarkers', 'clinical outcomes'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"

However, post-hoc analysis showed that the highest dose of vilobelimab significantly decreased the median counts of draining tunnels and the international HS4 score by 63%.', 'clinical_significance': 'These findings suggest that vilobelimab may have an adjunctive effect on reducing draining tunnels in patients with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, which could be clinically relevant despite not meeting the primary endpoint. Further investigation is warranted to explore the potential benefits of vilobelimab in this patient population.', 'methodology': 'The SHINE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial that enrolled 177 patients with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Patients were treated with either placebo or one of four doses of vilobelimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the complement split product C5a. The primary endpoint was the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at 16 weeks.', 'limitations': 'The study did not meet its primary endpoint, potentially due to an unexpectedly high placebo response rate. Additionally, the post-hoc analysis on draining tunnels and the international HS4 score was not pre-specified, and the study was not powered to detect these secondary outcomes.', 'keywords': ['hidradenitis suppurativa', 'vilobelimab', 'C5a', 'draining tunnels', 'clinical trial'], 'confidence_score': 0.85, 'summary_length': 'concise'}"
41077924,Utility of MRI perilesional biopsy in prostate cancer: impact of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System and biopsy history.,Cannoletta D; Stabile A; Quarta L; Barletta F; Pellegrino F; Scuderi S; Porzi ME; Scilipoti P; Robesti D; Longoni M; Mazzone E; Brembilla G; De Cobelli F; Gandaglia G; Karnes JR; Roupret M; Montorsi F; Briganti A,,BJU Int,,2025 Oct 13,"{'main_findings': 'The study found that overall, targeted biopsies plus systematic biopsies (TBx + SBx) had a higher detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) compared to targeted biopsies plus perilesional biopsies (TBx + PLBx), particularly in patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions and those on active surveillance. However, TBx + PLBx may be considered in PI-RADS 4-5 lesions to reduce detection of insignificant prostate cancer.', 'clinical_significance': 'The findings suggest that TBx + SBx should remain the preferred biopsy strategy, especially for patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions and those on active surveillance, as it offers the highest detection of csPCa. TBx + PLBx may be considered in select cases to reduce detection of insignificant prostate cancer.', 'methodology': 'This retrospective study analyzed data from 2,852 patients with PI-RADS ≥3 lesions who underwent TBx + SBx at three tertiary referral centers. The primary outcome was detection of csPCa (ISUP Grade Group ≥2) between the two biopsy strategies, stratified by PI-RADS score and biopsy history.', 'limitations': 'The study was retrospective, and the decision to perform PLBx in addition to TBx was at the discretion of the treating urologist, which may have introduced selection bias.

This information could be useful for healthcare providers in understanding and managing patients' emotional experiences and responses."", 'methodology': 'The study consisted of two separate investigations with a total of 277 participants. Participants completed self-report measures of emotional awareness and underwent tasks to assess various components of emotional reactivity.', 'limitations': 'The study relied on self-report measures and laboratory tasks, which may not fully capture real-world emotional experiences.
