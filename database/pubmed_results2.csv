41086370,Lung-targeted Lipid Nanoparticle Delivery of a Matricellular mRNA Promotes Fibrotic Lung Repair.,Betageri KR; Meridew JA; Parrett BJ; Gilbert RM; Link PA; Schussler NA; Mercado-Perez A; Caporarello N; Barry MA; Tschumperlin DJ,,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,,2025 Oct 14,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung disease where scarring and stiffening of the lungs makes it difficult to breathe. In this study, researchers explored a new way to deliver treatments directly to the lungs using tiny lipid nanoparticles. They tested whether these lung-targeted nanoparticles could safely deliver a specific protein-encoding mRNA to the lungs of healthy and fibrotic mice, both young and old. The researchers found that the nanoparticles successfully delivered the mRNA to the lung tissue, without causing harmful side effects. Excitingly, when they delivered mRNA for a protein called CCN3 to older mice with established lung fibrosis, it helped promote repair and reduce scarring in the lungs. This suggests that targeted delivery of beneficial proteins could be a promising new approach to treat pulmonary fibrosis, a debilitating disease that currently has limited treatment options. While more research is needed, this study demonstrates the potential of using specialized nanoparticles to selectively target and deliver therapies to the lungs, which could lead to more effective and safer treatments for patients with fibrotic lung diseases."
41085838,Rapid early progression of glioblastoma: evaluation of a novel prognostic radiologic biomarker.,Guzzino J; Crompton DJ; Agarwal S; Kern S; Bogan A; Vora SA; Quinones-Hinojosa A; Burns TC; Sherman WJ; Brown PD; Laack N; Peterson J; Uhm JH; Ruff MW; Sener UT; Breen WG; Trifiletti DM,,J Neurooncol,,2025 Oct 14,"This research study examined a concerning phenomenon called ""rapid early progression"" (REP) in patients with glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer. Glioblastoma often grows and spreads quickly, and the researchers wanted to better understand how frequently this rapid progression occurs and what factors might contribute to it. 

The researchers reviewed medical scans and records for over 400 glioblastoma patients who received radiation therapy. They found that REP, defined as significant tumor growth between the initial surgery and the start of radiation treatment, occurred in over 60% of patients. REP was more common in patients who had less of the tumor removed during surgery. Importantly, the time between surgery and radiation treatment did not seem to impact REP, suggesting the tumor's biology, not just treatment delays, drives this rapid progression. Patients with REP, especially more severe cases, had shorter progression-free survival times.

These findings highlight REP as an important biomarker that could help identify glioblastoma patients at highest risk of rapid disease progression. This knowledge could inform treatment decisions and the development of new therapies to better target this aggressive cancer. However, more research is still needed to fully understand the causes of REP and how to prevent or mitigate it for glioblastoma patients."
41085575,Cognitive impact of repeated surgical resections for the management of high-grade glioma.,Koay JM; Dion C; Michaelides L; Chaichana K; Gruenbaum BF; Middlebrooks EH; Quinones-Hinojosa A; Sabsevitz DS,,J Neurooncol,,2025 Oct 14,"High-grade gliomas are a type of aggressive brain tumor that can significantly impact a person's cognitive abilities and quality of life. This study examined how repeated surgical procedures to remove these tumors might affect a patient's cognitive performance over time. The researchers evaluated the cognitive skills of 67 adults with high-grade gliomas, comparing those who were undergoing their first tumor removal surgery to those who had undergone the procedure before. They tested abilities like attention, memory, and problem-solving both before and shortly after the surgery. Surprisingly, the researchers found no meaningful differences in cognitive outcomes between the two groups. Most patients showed little to no decline in their cognitive abilities, regardless of whether they were having their first or a repeat surgery. These findings suggest that repeat surgical resection can be a viable treatment option for recurrent brain tumors, as it does not appear to put patients at greater risk of cognitive impairment compared to initial surgery. While the study had a relatively small sample size and focused only on the short-term effects, it provides encouraging evidence that cognitive function can be preserved even with multiple brain tumor removal procedures. This information could help doctors and patients make more informed decisions about the best course of treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas."

41085249,State-of-the-Art Review of Current Technology in Pressure Injury Early Detection.,Tzen YT; Delmore B; M Bogie K; Sonenblum SE; Newton D; Vargo D; Ronin J; Hester A; Gillespie C; Tescher A; Iyer V; Brienza D,,Adv Skin Wound Care,,2025 Oct 14,"Pressure injuries, also known as bedsores, are a serious medical issue that can develop in patients who are bedridden or have limited mobility. These painful wounds can be difficult to detect early, leading to complications if not caught and treated promptly. This research paper reviewed the latest technologies being developed to help healthcare providers identify pressure injuries sooner. The researchers looked at both devices currently available on the market as well as experimental technologies still in development. They found that these new tools, which use methods like ultrasound, infrared imaging, and light-based measurements, can detect the early signs of pressure injury formation, such as inflammation and reduced blood flow, before the injury becomes visible on the skin. While these devices show promise, the researchers caution that they should not replace the standard practice of visually inspecting and feeling the skin. Instead, they recommend using these new technologies to supplement regular skin assessments, particularly for high-risk patients. Wider adoption of these innovative detection methods could lead to faster treatment and better outcomes for patients, reducing the burden of this common and debilitating condition on the healthcare system."
41085222,Predictors of wrist extensor muscle recovery following acute traumatic spinal cord injury: A model systems replication study.,Johnson BM; Johnson NK; Li Y; Reeves RK; Kirshblum S; Solinsky R,,PM R,,2025 Oct 14,"This research study looked at factors that can predict whether patients with high-level spinal cord injuries will regain the ability to extend their wrists, which is important for hand function and grasping. After a severe spinal cord injury, the nerves that control wrist extension are often damaged, making it difficult for patients to use their hands. Previous research from 1993 had identified a few key factors that could predict wrist extension recovery, but this study aimed to validate those findings using a much larger group of patients. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 35,000 people with acute spinal cord injuries, focusing on 219 cases where the patients initially had weak or no wrist extension. They looked at whether the patients' ability to feel touch on their upper arm, as well as the strength of the muscles in their upper arm and forearm, could predict whether the wrist extension would recover to a functional level within one year. The results showed that these factors were somewhat predictive, but not as strongly as the previous, smaller study had suggested. The best positive predictor was having at least some ability to extend the wrist, while the best negative predictor was a complete lack of feeling or movement in the upper arm. Based on these findings, the researchers created an updated tool to help clinicians provide more accurate prognoses for wrist extension recovery after spinal cord injury."
41085136,Mortality Trends in Atrial Fibrillation With Cardiomyopathy Among Patients Aged 25 and Older in the United States.,Naveed MA; Neppala S; Ali A; Rehan MO; Naveed H; Iqbal R; Azeem B; Ahmed M; Khan MZ; Agarwal S; Chigurupati HD; Shafi N; Sattar Y; Asad ZUA; Munir MB,,Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,2025 Oct 14,"This research examines a concerning trend in the United States - the rising number of deaths related to a combination of two serious heart conditions, atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) and cardiomyopathy (weakened heart muscle). The researchers analyzed national mortality data from 1999 to 2023 to understand how these conditions are impacting adults aged 25 and older. 

They found that deaths from this heart disease combination have steadily increased, with the rate rising from 1.8 per 100,000 people in 1999 to 3.0 per 100,000 in 2023. This upward trend is particularly pronounced in certain groups, including men, Black individuals, and those living in rural areas. The researchers note this represents a significant public health crisis that requires urgent attention and action. Understanding these mortality patterns can help guide prevention strategies and improve treatment approaches for patients with these co-occurring heart conditions. While the data provides valuable insights, the researchers acknowledge limitations in the available information, underscoring the need for continued monitoring and research in this critical area of cardiovascular health."
41084173,Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation Following Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Quelal Analuisa K; Arya N; Donisan T; Harmon D; Alkhouli M; Sugrue AM; Cha YM; Mackram EF; Deshmukh AJ,,J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol,,2025 Oct 13,"This research examined the factors that can lead to the need for a permanent pacemaker after a specific type of heart valve replacement procedure called valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR). ViV-TAVR is used to treat patients whose previous heart valve replacement has deteriorated over time. The researchers analyzed data from over 250 patients who underwent ViV-TAVR, looking at their medical history, test results, and details of the procedure. They found that certain factors, like pre-existing electrical conduction problems in the heart, the depth at which the new valve was placed, and the development of new electrical issues after the procedure, were strongly linked to the need for a permanent pacemaker. Interestingly, patients whose previous valve failed due to leakage rather than stiffening were less likely to require a pacemaker. The researchers also found that patients who needed a permanent pacemaker after ViV-TAVR had significantly higher mortality rates over the following years. These findings can help doctors better identify high-risk patients and plan the ViV-TAVR procedure accordingly, potentially reducing the need for pacemakers and improving outcomes for these patients."
41083288,Prognostic impact of SCAI shock severity classes in AMI-related cardiogenic shock: A sub-study of the ECLS-SHOCK Trial.,Pöss J; Jentzer J; Desch S; Feistritzer HJ; Freund A; Roßberg M; Jung C; Ouarrak T; Schneider S; Akin I; Rassaf T; Thevathasan T; Zeymer U; Thiele H,,ESC Heart Fail,,2025 Oct 13,"This research study examined the usefulness of a classification system called the SCAI (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions) Shock Severity Classification in predicting outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, a serious condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood. The researchers analyzed data from a large clinical trial that tested a treatment called extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for these patients. They found that patients classified as having more severe shock according to the SCAI system were more likely to die within 30 days, require dialysis, and experience poor neurological outcomes. However, the severity of shock did not affect whether the ECLS treatment was effective - the treatment worked equally well across all SCAI shock stages. These findings suggest the SCAI classification could help doctors better understand a patient's prognosis and guide treatment decisions, but the ECLS therapy may still benefit even the most critically ill patients. Limitations include that this was a secondary analysis of an existing trial, so more research is needed to fully validate the SCAI system in this patient population."
41082925,Intersurgeon Variability in Proptosis Reduction After Orbital Decompression for Thyroid Eye Disease: A Multicenter Analysis.,Hong A; Shoji MK; Villatoro GA; Radha-Saseendrakumar B; Baxter SL; Dolman PJ; Kazim M; Harrison AR; Lucarelli MJ; Garrity JA; Selva D; Ediriwickrema LS; Liu CY; Korn BS; Kikkawa DO,,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,,2025 Oct 13,"This study examined how much proptosis (bulging of the eyes) is reduced after orbital decompression surgery for patients with thyroid eye disease, and whether the amount of reduction varies between different surgeons. Thyroid eye disease can cause the eyes to bulge outwards, which can be disfiguring and lead to vision problems. Orbital decompression surgery is a common treatment to reduce proptosis, but the success of the surgery can depend on the surgeon's skill and technique. 

The researchers analyzed data from over 600 eye surgeries performed by 7 different surgeons at 7 different hospitals. They found that the amount of proptosis reduction was similar across surgeons, even when they used different surgical techniques. This suggests that with proper training and experience, surgeons can achieve consistent results in reducing eye bulging for patients with thyroid eye disease. The findings may help strengthen the validity of future clinical trials on orbital decompression, as they indicate that surgical outcomes are not overly dependent on the individual surgeon. This could lead to improved understanding of the best surgical approaches and better care for patients suffering from the disfiguring effects of thyroid eye disease."

41082711,Safety of immunotherapy post liver transplantation- A multicentered study of a prospective standardized clinical practice protocol.,Watt KD; Panda S; Pierluissi V; Abarca R; Rusch D; Tapia AL; Chascsa DMH; Abou-Alfa GK; Azhari H,,Liver Transpl,,2025 Oct 13,"This study examined the safety of using immunotherapy drugs, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), in liver transplant recipients who develop cancer. Liver transplant patients take medications to suppress their immune system and prevent organ rejection, which can make them more vulnerable to infections and cancer. However, ICIs work by boosting the immune system to fight cancer, raising concerns about potential rejection of the transplanted liver. 

The researchers developed a standardized protocol to carefully manage immunosuppression medications while administering ICIs to 20 liver transplant patients with advanced cancers. They closely monitored the patients for any signs of organ rejection or side effects from the immunotherapy. While a few patients experienced complications like pneumonitis or heart inflammation, most tolerated the treatment well. Importantly, the researchers found a low risk of the transplanted liver being rejected, suggesting that ICIs can be used safely in this high-risk population with proper management. Several patients even showed partial responses or slowed progression of their cancers. 

These findings indicate that liver transplant recipients should not be automatically excluded from potentially life-saving immunotherapy, provided that their immunosuppression is carefully monitored and adjusted. This could open up new treatment options for transplant patients with cancer, an area that has been understudied. Ongoing research is still needed to further optimize the balance between cancer control and organ rejection in this complex patient population."
41082621,A Long-Stay Unit Incorporating LPNs Into the Staffing Model: A New Innovation in Patient Flow.,Goodman KJ; Chambers SP; Brake KA; Christenson MM; Gnagey SJ; Masching KJ; Villont KM; Zimmerman AR; Newman JS,,J Nurs Adm,,2025 Oct 13,"This research aimed to address the growing challenge of ""discharge delays"" in hospitals, where patients are ready to leave the hospital but cannot be discharged due to various factors. With a shortage of nurses and increasing patient needs, hospitals are searching for innovative and cost-effective ways to provide quality care. The researchers developed a new care model that co-located patients with discharge delays in a specialized hospital unit, leveraging the skills of licensed practical nurses (LPNs) alongside registered nurses (RNs). In the first year, this unit successfully discharged 358 patients, and patients reported high satisfaction with their care. Nurses also felt less burned out and found more meaning in their work. This innovative approach demonstrates how hospitals can optimize the roles of different nursing staff to provide quality care without overburdening any one group. By incorporating LPNs into the care team, the hospital was able to reduce the overall nursing staff required while maintaining high-quality patient outcomes. This model offers a promising solution to the growing challenge of discharge delays and could help alleviate strain on the healthcare system."

41082342,Long-Term Outcomes After Fontan Conversion Operation: A Comparative Analysis Based on Type of Fontan Connection.,Moustafa A; Kholeif Z; Miranda WR; Connolly HM; Stephens EH; Dearani JA; Egbe AC,,Circ Heart Fail,,2025 Oct 13,"This medical research study looked at long-term outcomes for patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure, a complex heart surgery performed on children born with certain congenital heart defects. The researchers compared three groups of Fontan patients: those with the original atriopulmonary Fontan connection, those who had the connection converted to a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), and those who had the TCPC connection from the start. 

The study found that patients who had the conversion surgery to TCPC and those who had the TCPC connection initially had similar long-term survival rates over 15 years, around 50-60% surviving without needing a heart transplant. However, the researchers noted that the conversion surgery itself carries a high risk of complications and mortality. 

These results suggest that for many adult Fontan patients, the conversion surgery may not be the best treatment option, as the risks may outweigh the potential benefits. The researchers concluded that the length of time a patient has lived with the Fontan physiology, rather than the specific type of connection, may be the most important factor in determining long-term outcomes. This information can help guide treatment decisions and set realistic expectations for Fontan patients and their families."
41082311,Association Between Thyroid Disease and Scleritis Using a Population-Based Method.,Wang KY; Tanke LB; Xu TT; Liu LL; Reynolds MM; Hodge DO; Smith WM,,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,2025 Oct 13,"This study investigated the potential link between thyroid disease and a rare eye condition called scleritis. Scleritis is an inflammation of the white part of the eye that can be painful and lead to vision problems. Thyroid disorders, such as Graves' disease, are known to sometimes cause eye-related symptoms, so the researchers wanted to see if there was a connection between thyroid disease and scleritis as well.

The researchers reviewed medical records from a county in Minnesota to identify all patients diagnosed with scleritis over a 10-year period. They compared these patients to a control group of people without scleritis, matching them for age and sex. The team then checked if the patients in each group also had thyroid disease. 

While the results showed a slightly higher rate of thyroid disease in the scleritis group, this difference was not statistically significant. In other words, the data did not provide strong evidence of a link between thyroid disease and scleritis. However, the researchers did find a significant association between scleritis and other autoimmune conditions. 

This suggests that scleritis may be more closely tied to general autoimmune dysfunction rather than specific thyroid disorders. More research is still needed to fully understand the underlying causes and potential systemic connections of scleritis. But this study provides helpful information for doctors treating patients with eye inflammation or thyroid problems."
41082215,Slow-Tempo Music and Delirium/Coma-Free Days Among Older Adults Undergoing Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Khan BA; Khan SH; Perkins AJ; Heiderscheit A; Unverzagt FW; Wang S; Downs JH 3rd; Gao S; Chlan LL,,JAMA Intern Med,,2025 Oct 13,"In this medical study, researchers investigated whether listening to slow-tempo music could help reduce delirium, pain, and anxiety in older adults on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Delirium, a sudden change in mental state, is a common and serious problem for older ICU patients, affecting up to 80% of them. The researchers conducted a clinical trial where some patients listened to calming music through headphones twice a day, while others listened to silence. They measured the number of delirium-free days, as well as the severity of delirium, pain, and anxiety. However, the study found no significant differences between the music and control groups on any of these outcomes. While this was disappointing, it provides important information that can guide future research on supporting the mental health of vulnerable ICU patients. The study had some limitations, such as a relatively small sample size, that could have influenced the results. Overall, this research highlights the challenges of improving delirium and related symptoms in critically ill older adults, and the need for continued investigation into effective interventions."
41082199,Posttreatment Amyloid Levels and Clinical Outcomes Following Donanemab for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,Lu M; Kim MJ; Collins EC; Shcherbinin S; Ellinwood AK; Yokoi Y; Brooks DA; Hansson O; Knopman DS; Sims JR; Mintun MA,,JAMA Neurol,,2025 Oct 13,"Alzheimer's disease is a devastating condition that affects millions of people worldwide. As the disease progresses, a buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain is a key driver of the condition. This study explored whether reducing these amyloid levels through a new drug called donanemab could slow the clinical decline in people with early-stage Alzheimer's. The researchers conducted a large clinical trial, involving over 1,500 participants, to assess the relationship between amyloid levels after treatment and various measures of disease progression and biomarkers. They found that participants who received donanemab had lower amyloid levels compared to those who received a placebo, and these lower amyloid levels were strongly correlated with slower cognitive decline and improvements in other Alzheimer's-related biomarkers. This suggests that donanemab's ability to remove amyloid plaque is the key mechanism behind its potential clinical benefits. These findings support the use of amyloid levels as a surrogate marker for evaluating the effectiveness of Alzheimer's treatments, which could accelerate the development of new therapies and improve outcomes for patients with this debilitating disease."
